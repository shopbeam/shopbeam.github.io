<p><em>Farrar, Straus and Giroux</em></p>

<p>Autobiographical fiction is currently the thing (see: Ben Lerner, Karl Ove Knausgaard, etc.). Now, Rachel Cusk&#39;s new novel brings that trend one step further. Cusk dispenses with typical plot and arranges her novel in the form of ten conversations between a writer and the people she meets during a creative writing seminar in Athens. But just because this book&#39;s thin on plot doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t a total page-turner.</p>
