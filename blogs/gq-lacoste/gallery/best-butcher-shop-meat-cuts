Additional sizes and colors are always in the back. The butcher case is kinda like that—it&#39;s just a starting place—and the guy on the other side of the glass will happily pull exactly what you want (or great stuff you didn&#39;t even know existed) if you summon the courage to strike up a conversation. To build a relationship with your butcher, follow these tips from Rob Levitt, who co-owns The Butcher &amp; Larder, the first sustainable whole-animal shop in the meatpacking mecca of Chicago. It won&#39;t be long before your own butcher joins your tailor, your doctor, and your accountant as one of the most important advisers in your life.

<p><strong>1. Ask About Your Meat&#39;s Backstory.</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s very <em>Portlandia</em> to discuss how a cow lived before his date with the abbatoir, but meat&#39;s provenance actually does influence quality and flavor. So ask what the cattle were fed. Levitt stocks some beef from cows raised on strictly free- range grass pasture and some finished on grain before slaughter. Grass-fed beef tastes more rustic. With grain, he says, &quot;you get a really nice marbling, a nice fat cover on the outside. The beef doesn&#39;t have so much of that funky, iron-y flavor.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>2. Have Your Butcher Plan Your Party</strong>.</p>

<p> Let&#39;s say you&#39;re having a cookout. Tell the butcher about your guests (how many, how hungry, how picky) and he might be able to save you some hassle— and some cash. &quot;If you plan on buying a mammoth rib eye for each of your friends, it&#39;s gonna cost a lot of money,&quot; Levitt says. Instead, he&#39;d suggest buying a few brontosaurus-sized steaks to share. &quot;You cut off the bone, you slice them up, and you&#39;re ready to go.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>3. Learn to Love the Whole Barnyard. </strong></p>

<p> Tell your butcher what you like and let him suggest something comparable but offbeat. &quot;If you&#39;re used to eating beef and you want something different, lamb is a great place to start,&quot; Levitt says. Any butcher should have shanks; braised in beer or red wine, they&#39;ll make a hearty entrée come fall.</p>

<p><strong>4. Make Sirloin Popsicles.</strong></p>

<p> Buy more than you need and ask for any extra to be wrapped in freezer paper, Levitt says. Unlike regular butcher paper, it has a plastic lining that creates a moisture barrier. Put the wrapped meat in a vacuum-sealable FoodSaver bag or a zip-top freezer bag with the air squeezed out, and then freeze.</p>

<p><strong>5. Call Ahead for That Hog Snout</strong>.</p>

<p> With a week or two of notice, butchers can special-order just about anything. They&#39;ll pull together veal-and-pork sausages like Nonna used to make. They&#39;ll get you a whole suckling pig for your Labor Day blowout. Basically, they&#39;ll procure whatever&#39;s too esoteric to take up regular space in the display window. Levitt hardly flinches at orders for blood sausage or chicken feet. &quot;We&#39;ve had science teachers ask if they can get eyeballs from us.&quot;</p></div><span data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.0.2.0.0.0.5.0.3.1"></span></div></div></div></main></div><div class="col col-md-6" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.0.2.0.1"><aside class="slideshow-aside" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0"><div class="component-counter" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter"><div class="counter" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0"><span class="current" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.0">1</span><span class="divider" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.1">of</span><span class="total" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.2">4</span></div></div><span class="component-toggle toggle-thumbnails" aria-label="Toggle Button" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.3">Toggle Thumbnails</span><div class="gqGalleryBox displayAd displayAd300x250 displayAd300x250Js gallery-aside-ad not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBox300x250_frame" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.4:0"></div></aside></div></div></div></div><div class="gallery-bottom-container" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.1"><div class="col col-md-14 gallery-bottom-pane" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.1.0"><div class="gqGalleryBan displayAd displayAd728x90 displayAd728x90Js gq-gallery-banner not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBan728x90_frame" data-reactid=".7cjsgkc6io.1:3.0.1.0.0"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
