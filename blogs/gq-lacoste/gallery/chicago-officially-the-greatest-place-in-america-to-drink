(See: The Blues Brothers, Polish immigration, winter, et al.) But the Second City has hit its boozy stride. Right now, at this very minute, there isn&#39;t a city in America better suited to our favorite pastime. And we don&#39;t just mean for the schmoozers who can get past a tough door, or the barstool lifers who&#39;ve never missed happy hour. We mean everybody—the beer drinkers, the gin lovers, the rare-bourbon aficionados. The empty-pocketed deal-seekers and the name-dropping foodies. These days you can hardly walk a block without passing a packed new bar. It&#39;s a full-on drinkable renaissance, which is why it&#39;s time to book your tickets, do a cleanse in preparation, and get yourself to the Windy City.</div><span data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.0.2.0.0.0.5.0.3.1"></span></div></div></div></main></div><div class="col col-md-6" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1"><aside class="slideshow-aside" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0"><div class="component-counter" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter"><div class="counter" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0"><span class="current" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.0">1</span><span class="divider" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.1">of</span><span class="total" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.2">22</span></div></div><span class="component-toggle toggle-thumbnails" aria-label="Toggle Button" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.3">Toggle Thumbnails</span><div class="gqGalleryBox displayAd displayAd300x250 displayAd300x250Js gallery-aside-ad not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBox300x250_frame" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.4:0"></div></aside></div></div></div></div><div class="gallery-bottom-container" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.1"><div class="col col-md-14 gallery-bottom-pane" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.1.0"><div class="gqGalleryBan displayAd displayAd728x90 displayAd728x90Js gq-gallery-banner not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBan728x90_frame" data-reactid=".1tx2edydxc.1:3.0.1.0.0"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
