class="caption" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.0.2.0.0.0.5.0.3.0">Craft beer&#39;s universe of flavor spins out into seemingly endless variety—even the once humble shot-and-a-pint corner bar now bristles with tap handles. At times the scene seems pushed more by hype than taste—the rarest and most expensive aren&#39;t always the best—and the best aren&#39;t always the brashest. Agog at this brave new world, what&#39;s a thirsty guy to do? Here&#39;s your road map. But don’t take our word for it. We asked ten of the beer world&#39;s best palates to each pick five icons from their respective realms of expertise. Grab a pen and an empty glass (or fifty) and start checking them off. This is the golden age for beer. Your binge starts now.</div><span data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.0.2.0.0.0.5.0.3.1"></span></div></div></div></main></div><div class="col col-md-6" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1"><aside class="slideshow-aside" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0"><div class="component-counter" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter"><div class="counter" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0"><span class="current" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.0">1</span><span class="divider" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.1">of</span><span class="total" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.2">11</span></div></div><span class="component-toggle toggle-thumbnails" aria-label="Toggle Button" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.3">Toggle Thumbnails</span><div class="gqGalleryBox displayAd displayAd300x250 displayAd300x250Js gallery-aside-ad not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBox300x250_frame" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.4:0"></div></aside></div></div></div></div><div class="gallery-bottom-container" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.1"><div class="col col-md-14 gallery-bottom-pane" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.1.0"><div class="gqGalleryBan displayAd displayAd728x90 displayAd728x90Js gq-gallery-banner not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBan728x90_frame" data-reactid=".1hd0b94qqdc.1:3.0.1.0.0"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
