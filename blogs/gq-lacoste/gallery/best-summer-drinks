data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.0.2.0.0.0.5.0.3.0"><strong>The Champagne of Sodas</strong>

<p>Soda is a guilty pleasure, and for good reason: It&#39;s the equivalent of drinking a Twinkie through a straw, packed as it is with high-fructose corn syrup, chemical coloring, and in some cases phosphoric acid. (Alternate use: dissolving the rust off seagoing ships.) But homemade soda lets you swap the fake stuff for natural ingredients that would be too fragile to bottle and ship. Instead of saccharine and syrupy, you get subtle and quenching. Put another way, you get soda worth savoring.</p>

<p>The big-beverage conglomerates guard their recipes as if they&#39;re next on the WikiLeaks hit list, but whipping up a batch of homemade fizzy involves minimal effort. First, invest in a SodaStream, which carbonates tap water using CO2 cartridges. The recipe is simple: Dissolve sugar in boiling water to create simple syrup and keep a stock of it in your fridge. (It&#39;ll last about three months.) Combine it with soda water, add some fresh-squeezed juice, then serve your soda in an ice-filled Collins glass. And please, skip the straw.</p></div><cite data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.0.2.0.0.0.5.0.3.1">Photo: Jamie Chung</cite></div></div></div></main></div><div class="col col-md-6" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1"><aside class="slideshow-aside" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0"><div class="component-counter" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter"><div class="counter" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0"><span class="current" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.0">1</span><span class="divider" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.1">of</span><span class="total" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.2">7</span></div></div><span class="component-toggle toggle-thumbnails" aria-label="Toggle Button" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.3">Toggle Thumbnails</span><div class="gqGalleryBox displayAd displayAd300x250 displayAd300x250Js gallery-aside-ad not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBox300x250_frame" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.4:0"></div></aside></div></div></div></div><div class="gallery-bottom-container" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.1"><div class="col col-md-14 gallery-bottom-pane" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.1.0"><div class="gqGalleryBan displayAd displayAd728x90 displayAd728x90Js gq-gallery-banner not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBan728x90_frame" data-reactid=".2eyphigbda8.1:3.0.1.0.0"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
