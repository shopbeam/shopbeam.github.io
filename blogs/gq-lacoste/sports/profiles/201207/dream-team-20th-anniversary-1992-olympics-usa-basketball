  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A It was always a silly rule. According to international basketball guidelines in place for decades, professionals from leagues all over the world could compete for their countries at the Olympics—but NBA players could not. The effect was to balance out America\u0027s towering advantage in the sport. You know, give the poor bastards a chance. The rule was dropped in April 1989, though, after the United States finished a humiliating third at the previous summer\u0027s Olympics in Seoul. Parity, everyone learned, wasn\u0027t nearly as captivating as dominance. And make no mistake: Dominating was as important as winning. The idea was to dazzle, to put on a display of American might so awe-inspiring that the best our rivals could hope for was a silver medal. Or even better, Michael Jordan\u0027s autograph.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000APART I: Origins\u000A\u000A \u0022The cast on this team—it was the best of the best.\u0022 \u000A\u000A David Stern (NBA commissioner): The notion that the NBA wanted to redeem the 1988 loss? Patently wrong. From our view, we were stuck with playing in the Olympics. We didn\u0027t see it becoming the phenomenon that it became.\u000A\u000A David Falk (agent for Michael Jordan): There was a growing recognition that we were putting college players out at a time when every other country was putting out pros. And were we being naive to continue that, just because there\u0027s a history?\u000A\u000A Stern: We said to FIBA [the international basketball federation] that we weren\u0027t gung ho to play in the Olympics, but we would try to be good soldiers to support basketball. So they had a vote. The U.S. was against it, and the Russians were against it, too. But the overwhelming vote was in favor.\u000A\u000A Russ Granik (NBA liaison to Team USA): The first tough decision was that it had to be an NBA coach, in order for our owners and players to feel comfortable. But Chuck Daly was a pretty easy choice: He was coming off back-to-back championships with the Detroit Pistons; he had a reputation for being able to deal with smart players; he was great with the media.\u000A\u000A Quinn Buckner (Team USA selection committee): The biggest thing was, you did not want to offend any of these guys. Chuck had to be extra sensitive, a lot like at an all-star game. Because with players of that quality, if you offend them, every time the Pistons saw that player, they were going to take it out on Chuck, on his team.\u000A\u000A Granik: There was a lot of discussion about Larry Bird, because Larry had started having back problems. He clearly wasn\u0027t anywhere near what his peak had been, but if you were putting together such a historic team, you couldn\u0027t leave him off.\u000A\u000A Magic Johnson (Team USA point guard): This was our final moment—the curtain was going to come down. Larry\u0027s back was messed up. And I was already out, dealing with HIV, so we had to make sure that we went out the right way. For me, it was also about showing the world that I could still play, even living with HIV.\u000A\u000A Patrick Ewing (Team USA center): That was my second Olympics—mine, Michael [Jordan], and Chris [Mullin]. We played in the \u002784 Olympics together, and we had a great team then. But the cast on this team—it was the best of the best. I knew it was going to be something special.\u000A\u000A Karl Malone (Team USA power forward): I had an opportunity my freshman year at Louisiana Tech to try out for the Olympic team, and I didn\u0027t make it. Got cut. It was one of the first times playing basketball that a coach told me I wasn\u0027t good enough. That always stuck in the back of my mind.\u000A\u000A Granik: The last player, as I recall, was between Clyde Drexler and Isiah Thomas, and you had two pretty great résumés there. I don\u0027t know what the final vote was—I never asked—but when they counted, it came out for Clyde.\u000A\u000A David DuPree (reporter for USA Today): If they were selecting solely on ability and accomplishments, Isiah Thomas may have deserved it. But who are you going to leave off? Nobody was tougher than John Stockton; nobody was a better passer. John Stockton was a tough son of a bitch.\u000A\u000A Jan Hubbard (NBA columnist for Newsday): Stockton broke a bone in his leg, and it healed very quickly. But initially they were going to replace him, and it was going to be Joe Dumars. So Isiah wasn\u0027t even going to be the first substitute.\u000A\u000A Rod Thorn (Team USA selection committee): Charles Barkley was one of the last guys put on the team. You wanted to make sure that everything went smoothly, that everybody represented the way you wanted them to represent. And there were some who, frankly, were worried about Barkley. But then he ended up being the leading scorer.\u000A\u000A P.J. Carlesimo (Team USA assistant coach): People look back and go, \u0022Look at these other guys—why would they have a college guy?\u0022 People forget, Christian Laettner is arguably the best college player ever. Show me somebody else who accomplished what he did in four years.\u000A\u000A Christian Laettner (Team USA power forward): I tell people all the time, my favorite year at Duke—even though I won championships my junior year and senior year—was my freshman year. Because that\u0027s when you\u0027re at the bottom of the ladder and you\u0027re working your way up, and you gotta go one hundred miles an hour all the time. So I never minded being in that position. I was lucky. I was in awe every moment I was around them.\u000A\u000A Granik: One of the most difficult things was dealing with some of Michael Jordan\u0027s endorsement issues. He was in a class by himself, breaking a lot of ground, and a lot of that conflicted with what the U.S. Olympic Committee assumed they were entitled to do with all their athletes. We really had long and difficult negotiations with Michael and with Nike.\u000A\u000A Falk: It wasn\u0027t anything adversarial. We just had to sit down and work it out.\u000A\u000A Craig Miller (USA Basketball director of public relations): You\u0027d see the list of names growing, and then it became apparent that this was going to be a special team. I think probably the real turning point was the cover of Sports Illustrated. When you saw who was on that cover, you were like, \u0022Wow.\u0022\u000A\u000A Next: PART II: Gods. vs. Babies &amp;gt;&amp;gt;\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A _The hot-tempered Barkley worried some Team USA\u000A\u000Aecutives, but he ended up as the squad\u0027s leading scorer\u000A\u000Aand its most affable off-the-court ambassador. _\u000A\u000A PART II: Gods vs. Babies\u000A\u000A \u0022Make sure you get your sleep, because tomorrow I\u0027m gonna bust your ass.\u0022\u000A\u000A In late June, the players gathered for the first time at a luxury hotel in La Jolla, California, outside San Diego, for a few days of scrimmages against some of the nation\u0027s top college stars. \u000A\u000A Mike Krzyzewski (Team USA assistant coach): The first meeting as a coaching staff, Chuck says to P.J. and I, \u0022Both of you guys have got to learn one thing.\u0022 So we\u0027ve got our notebooks, and we\u0027re ready to write this down. And he says, \u0022Both of you have to learn to ignore.\u0022 We said, \u0022What do you mean?\u0022 \u0022You college guys—you\u0027re looking for every little thing, and you make big things out of it. We\u0027re not going to be sticklers. These guys are men. If there\u0027s something that\u0027s big, we\u0027ll take care of it.\u0022\u000A\u000A Chris Webber (college squad player): I rode from the airport in a limo with Larry Bird, and that was such an honor. We talked about playing against the Pistons, different moves, all this stuff. He was just a great dude. Then, as we got out of the car and I was getting my bags, he goes, \u0022Make sure you get your sleep, because tomorrow I\u0027m gonna bust your ass, and you\u0027re going to remember it the rest of the week.\u0022\u000A\u000A Allan Houston (college squad player): When we got to the gym, there was this balcony [overlooking] the gym, so we didn\u0027t walk right in. It was almost, like, suspenseful. We look down and we see Barkley dunking. We see Michael stealing from somebody and doing one of his things where he takes off from outside the lane and double-pumps under the rim. We\u0027re like, \u0022Wow, they do this in practice, too?\u0022\u000A\u000A Laettner: I remember looking up and seeing my college teammates standing up there, and then the next play, Barkley thunder-dunks on Malone. Every one of them, their jaw was on the floor.\u000A\u000A The first scrimmage between the Dream Team and the college all-stars, on June 24, has become legendary, for unlikely reasons. \u000A\u000A Miller: Coach Daly told the college team coaches he wanted them to play like international players, so when they got near the three-point line, just jack it.\u000A\u000A Houston: We were asked to play a style that they hadn\u0027t really seen a lot of yet. We figured we had nothing to lose. So we go in there, and Penny gets a couple dunks. I remember hitting a couple of shots. Everybody\u0027s kind of flowing.\u000A\u000A Penny Hardaway (college squad player): They just thought, \u0022Okay, they got these young guys to give us a little warm-up. We\u0027re going to beat them up a little bit, sign a couple autographs, and then everybody go on about their merry way.\u0022 They didn\u0027t know how talented we really were.\u000A\u000A Brian McIntyre (NBA vice president of public relations): Penny had a couple of steals at midcourt, and everyone was going, \u0022Whoa.\u0022 There was—I can still feel it—there was tension. First day!\u000A\u000A Charles Barkley (Team USA power forward): The first time we saw them, they looked like babies. We were like, \u0022Hey, man, let\u0027s don\u0027t kill these little kids.\u0022 And they were playing like it was Game 7. Before we knew it, they upset us.\u000A\u000A Houston: The clock ran out—we had a twenty-minute clock—and we were up. And everybody looked around sheepishly, like, This is not supposed to happen. Nobody said anything for a few minutes.\u000A\u000A Malone: We took them for granted, and they kicked our butt. And Coach Daly just had that look on his face like, \u0022Well, this is what we told you guys. You gotta be ready.\u0022 After that, we was chomping at the bit to play them again that same day, but he didn\u0027t let us. He let us stew on it a little bit.\u000A\u000A Webber: When we busted their ass, they didn\u0027t say any prima donna stuff—\u0022We let you win.\u0022 That night was special. I remember me and Bobby Hurley decimating the golf course on some golf carts because we were so excited.\u000A\u000A Houston: Back at the hotel, I was on the same elevator as Bird and C-Webb, and C-Webb was chirping. Bird got off the elevator and said, \u0022Don\u0027t worry, tomorrow\u0027s a new day.\u0022 He kind of left us with that thought. And yeah, we got back in there, and it was a new day. [laughs] \u000A\u000A Barkley: We sent them a little message.\u000A\u000A Webber: We didn\u0027t score a point. Not one point. Not a point on a free throw, not a point in the game. We were the perfect wake-up call for them, and they were the perfect reality check for us.\u000A\u000A McIntyre: When the buzzer sounded, Barkley walks over to the other bench and says, \u0022You guys are just lucky we didn\u0027t come out with an attitude today.\u0022 Just cracked me up.\u000A\u000A Hardaway: We went to MJ\u0027s room afterward and you know how college kids are: \u0022Hey, man! Lemme get some shoes? Everything in your room—just let us have it, bro! I know you can get some more!\u0022\u000A\u000A Webber: Penny didn\u0027t tell you we were on a covert mission. I got socks. I got T-shirts. I asked Jordan for an earring. Some of the stuff I have, my grandkids will have to take it to the Hall of Fame, because I\u0027m gonna keep it until I die. It was awesome. It was the best time. It was the best time.\u000A\u000A Technically, Team USA still had to qualify for the Olympics, so it flew up to Portland, Oregon, for its official debut at the Tournament of the Americas on June 28. \u000A\u000A Marv Albert (NBC announcer): I remember the first time I saw the team walk out, I got the chills. It was, to me, the greatest collection of players comprising a team sport I had ever seen. The first game, they beat Cuba by seventy-nine points.\u000A\u000A DuPree: It was like guys in tank tops and cutoffs playing against them. Well, it wasn\u0027t that bad, but that was the image you got in your mind. They tried.\u000A\u000A Malone: I\u0027m not going to say it was a cakewalk, but it was easy.\u000A\u000A Laettner: The speed of the games was off the charts. Everyone was so athletic and so strong—just the alpha males at every position. \u000A\u000A Stern: The opposing teams were more interested in taking photos with our players than playing against them.\u000A\u000A Nathaniel Butler (official NBA photographer): We were sitting on the baseline. Magic is backing a guy down, and the guy on defense is yelling at his bench, \u0022Now! Now!\u0022 And on the bench, one guy\u0027s pulling a camera out of his sock and taking a photo of his teammate.\u000A\u000A Hubbard: One time they were playing against Venezuela, and the guy who was guarding Magic kept on saying, \u0022I need your shoes! I need your shoes!\u0022 During the game. And Magic goes, \u0022Look, I need my shoes!\u0022\u000A\u000A Lenny Wilkens (Team USA assistant coach): We thought it was funny. But it changed over the years. We always said, \u0022Next time, they won\u0027t bring cameras. They\u0027ll just bring their basketball.\u0022\u000A\u000A PART III: The Princes of Monte Carlo &amp;gt;&amp;gt;\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A _Jordan\u0027s supremacy occasionally irked Barkley, who felt\u000A\u000Ahe was anyone\u0027s equal._\u000A\u000A PART III: The Princes of Monte Carlo\u000A\u000A \u0022The guys were teasing Michael because he was playing golf every morning. Well, that did it.\u0022 \u000A\u000A After romping through the Tournament of the Americas, the Dream Team flew to Monte Carlo for a few days of practice, casino gambling, and golf before the opening ceremonies in Barcelona. \u000A\u000A Miller: I remember the general manager at our hotel telling us before we got there, \u0022This is Monte Carlo. This is a place that kings and queens come to, that rock bands come to. And to be honest, basketball? People aren\u0027t that excited.\u0022 And we said, \u0022Okay.\u0022 The night we flew in, literally, people are wall-to-wall in the parking lot, cheering and waving. There is no security control at all. I saw the manager, and he kind of threw his hands up. I always talk about his line: \u0022This is Monte Carlo! We have kings and queens and rock bands come all the time!\u0022\u000A\u000A Kim Bohuny (NBA manager of international events): We had a dinner with Prince Rainier and Prince Albert. There\u0027s very strict protocol. You know, you can\u0027t eat until Prince Rainier eats—things like that. We were reviewing it with the team beforehand, and I think it shocked some of our guys.\u000A\u000A Miller: They said if the prince puts his fork down and stops eating, you all better stop eating. And Charles said, \u0022Well, I hope he stops when I\u0027m done eating my meal, because I\u0027m eating my meal.\u0022\u000A\u000A Malone: I\u0027m from the country. Our etiquette is pretty much, \u0022Pass me the beans,\u0022 and we pass it down. No disrespect to the prince—it took me a while to understand the rules. This glass was on this side, and this fork was for this... You know what? Let me eat. You\u0027re talking about a fish out of water—that\u0027s how I felt. I had a nice suit on, I guess.\u000A\u000A Carlesimo: Those practices in Monte Carlo were legendary. There was no college team, so that was actually the first time we went against each other.\u000A\u000A Malone: The coaches always kept Magic and Michael on different teams.\u000A\u000A Hubbard: There was one moment where Krzyzewski claps his hands and says, \u0022Okay, plenty of time.\u0022 And Michael is at the other end of the court, and he shouts out: \u0022Fuck that! We\u0027re going to win this game. Fuck that.\u0022 You gotta figure Coach K never heard that at a Duke practice.\u000A\u000A Krzyzewski: That\u0027s why he\u0027s the greatest player ever. That afternoon, the intensity of it was just beautiful to witness.\u000A\u000A Johnson: Oh man, the best basketball I ever played was during those practices. Because everybody said, \u0022Let\u0027s strap up.\u0022\u000A\u000A Wilkens: Our last scrimmage, Magic\u0027s team was dominating Michael\u0027s team. And the guys were teasing Michael, because he was playing golf every morning. Well, that did it. The whole thing turned around.\u000A\u000A Thorn: He got upset, so he started to score every time down the floor. One time he drove, and the refs called, like, a real tick-tack foul. So Magic booted the ball up to the ceiling: \u0022This is ridiculous! Just like the NBA! He gets every call!\u0022\u000A\u000A Hubbard: Magic was saying, \u0022This must be what it\u0027s like playing in Chicago Stadium,\u0022 because Michael was getting the calls. And Michael said, \u0022Well, this is the \u002790s, not the \u002780s.\u0022\u000A\u000A Johnson: Michael was going at Clyde; Clyde was going at Michael. David Robinson was going at Patrick Ewing; Patrick was going after him. Karl Malone was going after Barkley, Barkley after Malone. We were just going at it, man.\u000A\u000A Wilkens: It got so heated we had to stop it.\u000A\u000A Hubbard: Afterward, Charles was in a really grumpy mood. He said, \u0022He\u0027s not the only great player on this team,\u0022 stuff like that. I actually got Jordan alone, and he was kind of sheepish that he had rubbed it in so bad. He said, \u0022How\u0027s your boy?\u0022 and he meant Barkley. And I said, \u0022Well, you know, he\u0027s kind of upset.\u0022 And Michael said, \u0022He\u0027ll get over it.\u0022 That was Michael. Even on something like that, he just had to kick your ass.\u000A\u000A Barkley: Look, you had ten all-stars going at it nonstop, trying to prove a point. Everybody had ego invested.\u000A\u000A Carlesimo: These guys were so competitive. You couldn\u0027t play for an hour and a half with them frothing at the mouth, because they\u0027d kill each other. A regular NBA team, if you\u0027re lucky, has one or two of these guys. We had twelve. They don\u0027t want to lose a drill, don\u0027t want to lose a shooting game, don\u0027t want to lose anything.\u000A\u000A PART IV: Showtime &amp;gt;&amp;gt;\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A _Magic had just retired because of HIV; Bird would soon\u000A\u000Afollow. Jordan was the new king._\u000A\u000A PART IV: Showtime\u000A\u000A \u0022You ever watch a lion or a leopard or a cheetah pouncing on their prey?\u0022 \u000A\u000A On to Barcelona. Because of security concerns, the Dream Team passed on staying at the Olympic Village and instead set up shop at the Ambassador Hotel, just off the city\u0027s main drag, Las Ramblas. \u000A\u000A Miller: We had a helicopter that followed us from the airport. One guy on a motorcycle had a briefcase which we learned had, like, Uzis inside.\u000A\u000A Albert: It\u0027s been said many times—it was like the Beatles. They were rock stars.\u000A\u000A Ewing: We were like the Beatles. We were rock stars.\u000A\u000A Branford Marsalis (bandleader, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno): Going to the Olympics was one of the perks of working on The Tonight Show. I went to the players\u0027 hotel, and the security guard says, \u0022Hello, sir!\u0022 and waves me in. I was like, \u0022Shit, I guess they like The Tonight Show in Spain.\u0022 I saw a friend who worked for the NBA, and she said, \u0022How did you get in here?\u0022 I said, \u0022I don\u0027t know. Dude let me in.\u0022 So they went to the guard and said, \u0022Why\u0027d you let that guy in?\u0022 And he said, \u0022He\u0027s related to Magic, isn\u0027t he?\u0022 He thought I was Magic\u0027s little brother.\u000A\u000A DuPree: No matter what anybody says, Magic was in charge. I remember, near the end of the Olympics, [Sports Illustrated NBA writer] Jack McCallum and I wanted to get our picture taken with the Dream Team, just to have a keepsake. Jack was tight with Karl Malone, so one night he asked Karl if he thought it would be okay. And Karl says, \u0022It shouldn\u0027t be a problem. Let me check with Magic.\u0022 If Magic said go, it was go. If Magic said stop, it was stop.\u000A\u000A McIntyre: I had about eighty basketballs in my room in Barcelona and had to get the players to sign them all. Bird was the last guy, and he says, \u0022What\u0027s the quickest anyone\u0027s done it?\u0022 I said, \u0022Anywhere from eight minutes to twenty.\u0022 And Bird said, \u0022I\u0027m going to be the fastest. Time me.\u0022 So he signs them, and he throws me the last one: \u0022Okay, what is it?\u0022 \u0022Whoa, four and a half minutes!\u0022 And he goes, \u0022Yes!\u0022 Competitive right to the end.\u000A\u000A Bohuny: Other than Charles, it was too hard to go out. You were mobbed. Charles loved it. He wasn\u0027t afraid of the crowds.\u000A\u000A Barkley: I wasn\u0027t going to stay in my room the whole time.\u000A\u000A Hubbard: Charles would walk down Las Ramblas, and people would say, \u0022Charles, what are you doing for security?\u0022 And he\u0027d show you his two fists and say, \u0022This is my security.\u0022 He was like the Pied Piper. He\u0027d have this huge group of people following and yelling and smiling and taking pictures. And he loved it.\u000A\u000A DuPree: Barkley did this first-person column where he would meet up with me after the games and tell me stuff, and I\u0027d write it up. He\u0027d say \u0022Meet me at such and such club,\u0022 so I\u0027d go to the club, and of course, no Barkley, but there\u0027d be a note saying meet him at some other club. So it would take about four or five clubs until about six in the morning before I could track him down. But he always left a note.\u000A\u000A Marsalis: I saw a lot of the guys around the hotel. I saw Jordan sitting watching Angola on tape, just staring, looking for weaknesses. I said, \u0022I don\u0027t even want to bother you, but why are you watching this game?\u0022 And he said, \u0022I always take my opponent seriously. I never underestimate anyone.\u0022 It wasn\u0027t lost on me that he was the only guy watching the game.\u000A\u000A Wilkens: Angola was physical. They were aggressive. They played hard. One guy hit Charles in the back of the head with a forearm.\u000A\u000A Herlander Coimbra (Team Angola): We felt like we were the luckiest guys in the world. We were going to play against the best, but also against African-Americans—our little cousins from America. During warm-ups we tried spectacular dunks to show them that we could play like in the NBA. They didn\u0027t dunk even once. They were really serious, all business. To keep our hopes up, our coach told us that only Larry Bird and Michael Jordan were really, really good—that the other Dream Teamers were just okay. But those guys were on another level—a galaxy far, far away. We tried to do our best, but our emotion got the better of us.\u000A\u000A Barkley: They were playing a little chippy, and I warned him a couple of times. I thought he was getting away with a couple of little cheap shots.\u000A\u000A Wilkens: We thought it was amusing, but Charles was not going to let him get away with it. He chased him the whole way down the court.\u000A\u000A Coimbra: I was listening to my coach on the sideline when suddenly Barkley elbowed me in the chest.\u000A\u000A Barkley: Well, he should have been paying attention.\u000A\u000A Coimbra: After the game, all the journalists wanted to talk to me about the incident. They wanted to know why. Did I say anything to provoke Barkley? I told them I didn\u0027t do anything. For the next days, that\u0027s all the press wanted to talk about. It became so crazy that I had to say in a statement that we only came here to show how good we were. We didn\u0027t want to feed the rumors. But between us, we talked about it. We were not really surprised that Barkley did that, because he was known to be a dirty player.\u000A\u000A Stern: Now it\u0027s the Dream Team of blessed memory, but at the time it was \u0022the U.S. bullies!\u0022\u000A\u000A Hubbard: Chuck started Michael and Magic every game and then rotated the other three. Pippen would start one game, Mullin would start the next. Robinson and Ewing would alternate; Malone and Barkley would alternate. He was a master at managing. But in the second game against Croatia, there was never any doubt: He was putting Pippen on Toni Kukoc [who had just been drafted by the Bulls and had been offered a contract for more money than his future teammate]. Pippen and Jordan were tired of hearing about how great Kukoc was, because they were winning NBA championships.\u000A\u000A Malone: You ever watch a lion or a leopard or a cheetah pouncing on their prey? We had to get Michael and Scottie out of the locker room, because they was damn near pulling straws to see who guarded him. Kukoc had no idea.\u000A\u000A Toni Kukoc (Team Croatia), in a 2011 interview with ESPN: You always want to check people that you\u0027re bringing in. Are they tough enough physically and mentally? Can they respond when you need them to respond? I don\u0027t think they [had] anything against me personally. They\u0027re just testing me. And I later realized that Michael does that [to everyone] on a daily basis.\u000A\u000A Albert: Croatia had a pretty good team. But it didn\u0027t matter, under those circumstances.\u000A\u000A Carlesimo: It was beautiful, the way they played basketball. There were segments of the game where you watch, and you can\u0027t defend better than this. You can\u0027t rebound and run the floor and share the ball better than this. It was breathtaking. You watched because you wanted to see what was next from them—what would you see in this game that you might never see again?\u000A\u000A Granik: The only time we were sure we were going to win gold was in the second half of the final game. We were playing Croatia again, and they had a pretty good team with Kukoc and Drazen Petrovic. I remember seeing [America\u0027s FIBA representative] Dave Gavitt right after that final game, and everybody was celebrating, but what I could see on his face was relief.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A _\u0022It\u0027s been said many times,\u0022 says announcer Marv Albert.\u000A\u000A\u0022It was like the Beatles. They were rock stars.\u0022_\u000A\u000A The Dream Team won all of its games at the Barcelona Olympics by an average of forty-four points. Croatia came the closest of any opponent, losing by thirty-three points in the first game and then, in the gold-medal game, by a razor-thin thirty-two. \u000A\u000A Krzyzewski: During the medal ceremony, they were like kids. Here they had NBA championships and all that, but they were like kids. It was a beautiful moment.\u000A\u000A Ewing: It was like, the guys lost in \u002788, and so then they sent in the Navy Seals. We were the Navy Seals. We were the elite forces, the elite of the elite forces. We came in, and we kicked butt and took names and got everybody back home safely.\u000A\u000A Malone: It wasn\u0027t a gloating thing, it wasn\u0027t bragging, it was just, \u0022This is what we came to do.\u0022 We didn\u0027t come there to try and make world peace. We came there to win the gold medal and bring it back home and say to the other countries, \u0022Now you\u0027ve had our best.\u0022\u000A\u000A Granik: The one thing that got thrown in there at the last minute, which I don\u0027t think people had focused on, was the USOC coming in and saying, \u0022Well, of course, you all have to wear the Reebok jacket on the medal stand.\u0022 I think we could have avoided that problem if we had known.\u000A\u000A Tinker Hatfield (Nike creative director): MJ just put the flag right over it, and you couldn\u0027t see the Reebok logo. He was just super-loyal. We didn\u0027t even ask MJ to do it. He just did it.\u000A\u000A McIntyre: I\u0027m watching them up there and thinking, \u0022You know, I don\u0027t have a single souvenir.\u0022 So as Michael\u0027s walking off the court, I said, \u0022You don\u0027t want that sweat suit, do you?\u0022 And he says \u0022No, did you want it?\u0022 I said, \u0022I\u0027d love it.\u0022 He takes it off, throws it at me. It\u0027s still got the pins from where he covered up the Reebok logo and folded the flag over. I haven\u0027t touched it.\u000A\u000A Stern: I think the point was that the world of basketball invited the NBA to join it, and we said yes. And they have profited greatly from it, as have we—as has the overall sport of basketball. Now we see Dirk Nowitzki and Ricky Rubio and Tony Parker and Yao Ming and Manu Ginobili. And Luis Scola and Serge Ibaka and Luol Deng.\u000A\u000A DuPree: In my mind, there\u0027s 1992, and then there\u0027s all the other teams. You can flip a coin about which was the best of all the other teams. But \u002792 ain\u0027t in the coin flip.",

According to international basketball guidelines in place for decades, professionals from leagues all over the world could compete for their countries at the Olympics&#x2014;but NBA players could not. The effect was to balance out America&#x2019;s towering advantage in the sport. You know, <em>give the poor bastards a chance.</em> The rule was dropped in April 1989, though, after the United States finished a humiliating third at the previous summer&#x2019;s Olympics in Seoul. Parity, everyone learned, wasn&#x2019;t nearly as captivating as dominance. And make no mistake: Dominating was as important as winning. The idea was to dazzle, to put on a display of American might so awe-inspiring that the best our rivals could hope for was a silver medal. Or even better, Michael Jordan&#x2019;s autograph.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.2"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.3"><em>PART I: Origins</em></p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong><em>&quot;The cast on this team&#x2014;it was the best of the best.&quot; </em></strong></p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.6"> <strong>David Stern</strong> <em>(NBA commissioner):</em> The notion that the NBA wanted to redeem the 1988 loss? Patently wrong. From our view, we were stuck with playing in the Olympics. We didn&#x2019;t see it becoming the phenomenon that it became.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>David Falk</strong> <em>(agent for Michael Jordan):</em> There was a growing recognition that we were putting college players out at a time when every other country was putting out pros. And were we being naive to continue that, just because there&#x2019;s a history?</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.8"> <strong>Stern:</strong> We said to FIBA [the international basketball federation] that we weren&#x2019;t gung ho to play in the Olympics, but we would try to be good soldiers to support basketball. So they had a vote. The U.S. was against it, and the Russians were against it, too. But the overwhelming vote was in favor.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.9"> <strong>Russ Granik</strong> <em>(NBA liaison to Team USA):</em> The first tough decision was that it had to be an NBA coach, in order for our owners and players to feel comfortable. But Chuck Daly was a pretty easy choice: He was coming off back-to-back championships with the Detroit Pistons; he had a reputation for being able to deal with smart players; he was great with the media.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.a"> <strong>Quinn Buckner</strong> <em>(Team USA selection committee):</em> The biggest thing was, you did not want to offend any of these guys. Chuck had to be extra sensitive, a lot like at an all-star game. Because with players of that quality, if you offend them, every time the Pistons saw that player, they were going to take it out on Chuck, on his team.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.b"> <strong>Granik:</strong> There was a lot of discussion about Larry Bird, because Larry had started having back problems. He clearly wasn&#x2019;t anywhere near what his peak had been, but if you were putting together such a historic team, you couldn&#x2019;t leave him off.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.c"> <strong>Magic Johnson</strong> <em>(Team USA point guard):</em> This was our final moment&#x2014;the curtain was going to come down. Larry&#x2019;s back was messed up. And I was already out, dealing with HIV, so we had to make sure that we went out the right way. For me, it was also about showing the world that I could still play, even living with HIV.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.d"> <strong>Patrick Ewing</strong> <em>(Team USA center):</em> That was my second Olympics&#x2014;mine, Michael [Jordan], and Chris [Mullin]. We played in the &#x2019;84 Olympics together, and we had a great team then. But the cast on this team&#x2014;it was the best of the best. I knew it was going to be something special.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.e"> <strong>Karl Malone</strong> <em>(Team USA power forward):</em> I had an opportunity my freshman year at Louisiana Tech to try out for the Olympic team, and I didn&#x2019;t make it. Got cut. It was one of the first times playing basketball that a coach told me I wasn&#x2019;t good enough. That always stuck in the back of my mind.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.f"> <strong>Granik:</strong> The last player, as I recall, was between Clyde Drexler and Isiah Thomas, and you had two pretty great r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;s there. I don&#x2019;t know what the final vote was&#x2014;I never asked&#x2014;but when they counted, it came out for Clyde.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.g"> <strong>David DuPree</strong> <em>(reporter for </em>USA Today<em>):</em> If they were selecting solely on ability and accomplishments, Isiah Thomas may have deserved it. But who are you going to leave off? Nobody was tougher than John Stockton; nobody was a better passer. John Stockton was a tough son of a bitch.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.h"> <strong>Jan Hubbard</strong> <em>(NBA columnist for </em>Newsday<em>):</em> Stockton broke a bone in his leg, and it healed very quickly. But initially they were going to replace him, and it was going to be Joe Dumars. So Isiah wasn&#x2019;t even going to be the first substitute.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.i"> <strong>Rod Thorn</strong> <em>(Team USA selection committee):</em> Charles Barkley was one of the last guys put on the team. You wanted to make sure that everything went smoothly, that everybody represented the way you wanted them to represent. And there were some who, frankly, were worried about Barkley. But then he ended up being the leading scorer.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.j"> <strong>P.J. Carlesimo</strong> <em>(Team USA assistant coach):</em> People look back and go, &quot;Look at these other guys&#x2014;why would they have a college guy?&quot; People forget, Christian Laettner is arguably the best college player ever. Show me somebody else who accomplished what he did in four years.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.k"> <strong>Christian Laettner</strong> <em>(Team USA power forward):</em> I tell people all the time, my favorite year at Duke&#x2014;even though I won championships my junior year and senior year&#x2014;was my freshman year. Because that&#x2019;s when you&#x2019;re at the bottom of the ladder and you&#x2019;re working your way up, and you gotta go one hundred miles an hour all the time. So I never minded being in that position. I was lucky. I was in awe every moment I was around them.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.l"> <strong>Granik:</strong> One of the most difficult things was dealing with some of Michael Jordan&#x2019;s endorsement issues. He was in a class by himself, breaking a lot of ground, and a lot of that conflicted with what the U.S. Olympic Committee assumed they were entitled to do with all their athletes. We really had long and difficult negotiations with Michael and with Nike.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.m"> <strong>Falk:</strong> It wasn&#x2019;t anything adversarial.

During warm-ups we tried spectacular dunks to show them that we could play like in the NBA. They didn&#x2019;t dunk even once. They were really serious, all business. To keep our hopes up, our coach told us that only Larry Bird and Michael Jordan were really, really good&#x2014;that the other Dream Teamers were just okay. But those guys were on another level&#x2014;a galaxy far, far away.

They wanted to know why. Did I say anything to provoke Barkley? I told them I didn&#x2019;t do anything. For the next days, that&#x2019;s all the press wanted to talk about. It became so crazy that I had to say in a statement that we only came here to show how good we were. We didn&#x2019;t want to feed the rumors. But between us, we talked about it. We were not really surprised that Barkley did that, because he was known to be a dirty player.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.31"> <strong>Stern:</strong> Now it&#x2019;s the Dream Team of blessed memory, but at the time it was &quot;the U.S. bullies!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.32"> <strong>Hubbard:</strong> Chuck started Michael and Magic every game and then rotated the other three. Pippen would start one game, Mullin would start the next. Robinson and Ewing would alternate; Malone and Barkley would alternate. He was a master at managing. But in the second game against Croatia, there was never any doubt: He was putting Pippen on Toni Kukoc [who had just been drafted by the Bulls and had been offered a contract for more money than his future teammate]. Pippen and Jordan were tired of hearing about how great Kukoc was, because they were winning NBA championships.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.33"> <strong>Malone:</strong> You ever watch a lion or a leopard or a cheetah pouncing on their prey? We had to get Michael and Scottie out of the locker room, because they was damn near pulling straws to see who guarded him. Kukoc had no idea.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.34"> <strong>Toni Kukoc</strong> <em>(Team Croatia), in a 2011 interview with ESPN:</em> You always want to check people that you&#x2019;re bringing in. Are they tough enough physically and mentally? Can they respond when you need them to respond? I don&#x2019;t think they [had] anything against me personally. They&#x2019;re just testing me. And I later realized that Michael does that [to everyone] on a daily basis.</p><p data-reactid=".2a1uf0kz3eo.1.1.0.0.4.35"> <strong>Albert:</strong> Croatia had a pretty good team.

There were segments of the game where you watch, and you can&#x2019;t defend better than this. You can&#x2019;t rebound and run the floor and share the ball better than this. It was breathtaking.
