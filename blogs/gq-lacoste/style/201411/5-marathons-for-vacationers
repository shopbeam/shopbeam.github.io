<p><em>New York City</em></p>

<p> February 4</p>

<p>Once a year, the Empire State Building opens its stairwells for a footrace to the top. Thomas Dold, the German who won seven consecutive races from 2006 to 2012, explains the appeal of running those 1,576 steps.</p>

<p>&quot;The Empire State Building is an iconic building, that&#39;s the first thing. The second thing is that you have a really, really cool view above New York when you&#39;re on the top. And the feeling is completely different from what you get if you take the elevator. Because you look down on the street and you know: &#39;I have done it by myself. It&#39;s just me.&#39; And to get this very exciting feeling, you only have to wait eighty-six floors! The whole way up, you&#39;re looking forward to this moment when you get to the finish.&quot;</p>
