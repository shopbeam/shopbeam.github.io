  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestPhoto: Lane Stewart/ Getty\u000A\u000A  Michael Jordan\u0027s Most Influential Style Moves\u000A\u000AMichael Jordan was cute. I swear. Before he got the HeadBlade dome and the landing strip on his upper lip for a Hanes commercial, before he got his ear pierced back when he was 18 and the new face on Dean Smith\u0027s UNC Tar Heels—he was a cute kid. Boyish. His childhood nickname was Rabbit; his ears stuck out. He hadn\u0027t made high school varsity until he was a junior. Back then, he was on the short side for hoops. But then the pituitary kicked in and the world changed.\u000A\u000AI first really noticed Michael Jordan when the freshman\u0027s jumper put North Carolina up one point over Georgetown with seventeen seconds left in the 1982 NCAA championship game. As a crazed Hoya alum, I wasn\u0027t panicked—hey, we had All-American shooting guard Sleepy Floyd (who would go on to thirteen pro seasons) and a freshman named Patrick Ewing, who had already scored twenty-three points in the game. But then, like in a nightmare, Georgetown point guard Fred Brown inexplicably passed the ball to the Tar Heels\u0027 James Worthy, and Jordan\u0027s shot turned into the game winner. Michael Jordan and James Worthy... I would remember those names.\u000A\u000AWorthy, who scored twenty-eight in the game, looked like a man, with sad eyes and a full beard. Jordan looked like a skinny punk with his tongue wagging out of his mouth. But he played like a demon, and he was an All-American the next two seasons before forgoing his senior year to enter the NBA draft, going number three to the Bulls. The rest is history. Mike averaged twenty-eight points in his first season, made the All-Star team, and was Rookie of the Year.\u000A\u000AThe two freshman stars of the \u002782 championship game both changed basketball style. Ewing wore a T-shirt under his uniform, because he was always complaining about being cold in big arenas, and it caught on throughout college basketball with help from fellow frosh Chris Mullin. When Ewing went to the Knicks, he wanted to continue wearing a tee, but NBA rules wouldn\u0027t allow it. Eventually the undershirt trend faded.\u000A\u000AJordan\u0027s impact came a bit later, but it endured. In 1984, Nike put him under contract and then introduced the Air Jordan, the most expensive basketball shoe ever made. The first model was black, white, and red, violating the NBA\u0027s rules and getting Jordan fined $5,000 for every game he wore them. Nike paid the bill all the way to the bank. Jordan was wearing his red-white-and-black Air Jordans when he scored sixty-three points against the Celtics in an \u002786 playoff game. In 1989, with his hair receding, he shaved his head clean. Jordan—who wore his North Carolina team shorts under his Chicago Bulls shorts and thus needed some extra room—also asked that Champion give him a wider, longer pair. Jordan\u0027s teammate Scottie Pippen liked them so much he asked for the same. And so baggies came to the NBA, and thence to the Runnin\u0027 Rebels of UNLV, the Fab Five of Michigan, and then the world. (Except John Stockton.)\u000A\u000AOff the court, the young Michael Jordan always exhibited good taste—the right polo, the right jeans, the right sweatshirt, hey, even a rugby shirt. It was only later, as a multi-millionaire, that his moves may have been a bit off. He was always fashionable, but fashion itself goes wrong sometimes, and one of those times came at the height of his career: in the \u002790s, when Italian suits ruled the world. Remember Pat Riley cavorting on the sidelines, with his hair gel and his suits with the huge shoulders and the blousy pleated pants? Jordan wore similar suits (but no gel or hair), and in post-game interviews he sometimes resembled a cross between Dr. Evil and the character with the tiny head in Beetlejuice.\u000A\u000ABut Jordan\u0027s head was a thing of beauty. Bald men everywhere should worship him as a god for making the bald head manly and totemic. Sure, there was Yul Brynner as the petulant King of Siam, and Telly Savalas as Kojak—whom many menopausal women considered the sexiest man alive—but Jordan was like a hairless Hercules, a superman with a noble pate that made him look stronger than Samson, grinning like a death\u0027s-head at the opponents he would dunk over. Taking flight, His Airness made hair seem un-aerodynamic. Like bad design. Jordan\u0027s baldness made him as changeless as a sculpture. Monumental. Without Michael Jordan, there would be no Ving Rhames, no hair-free Samuel L. Jackson, no chrome-domed Shaquille O\u0027Neal, no cue-ball Kobe, no glabrescent Vin Diesel. Without Michael Jordan, there is a toupee industry. Without Michael Jordan, there is no sneaker industry. And the streetwear movement that has journeyed from asphalt basketball courts to Paris runways would never have been the same without number 23.\u000A\u000AWhen Nike\u0027s Air Jordans shattered the price ceiling on sneakers and hit three figures, sportswriters went ballistic, seeing the luxury-kicks market as a crime wave waiting to happen. Today the Jordan Shine model goes for $400 and nobody flinches. Nike\u0027s Air Yeezy Red October model is going for three to five grand on eBay.\u000A\u000ABut it all started with Mike. Remember the Nike ad with Spike Lee (as She\u0027s Gotta Have It protagonist Mars Blackmon) questioning Jordan?\u000A\u000AMB: What makes you the best player in the universe? Is it the vicious dunks?\u000A\u000AMJ: No, Mars.\u000A\u000AMB: Is it the haircut?\u000A\u000AMJ: No, Mars.\u000A\u000AMB: Is it the shoes?\u000A\u000AMJ: No, Mars.\u000A\u000AMB: Is it the extra-long shorts?\u000A\u000AMJ: No, Mars.\u000A\u000AMB: It\u0027s the shoes, then, right?\u000A\u000AMJ: Nah.\u000A\u000AMB: Is it the short socks?\u000A\u000AMJ: No, Mars.\u000A\u000AMB: Money, it\u0027s gotta be the shoes!\u000A\u000AMJ never fesses up to exactly what it is that makes him the best player in the universe. But there\u0027s no doubt in his self-assured, chiding replies that style is the essence of greatestness, just like it was when the O.G. Dr. J was the best player in the universe, with his windmill facials. Is it the goatee, Doctor? Is it the \u0027fro, Doctor?\u000A\u000AStyle is something that comes with the territory—with the ability to improvise in any situation and beat the shot clock of the universe. The juke, the hesitation, the pump fake, the fadeaway. Michael Jordan\u0027s sartorial style just came from within, like his moves on the court. The Zeitgeist flows from the heroes. And so it goes, two decades on. Big-ass shorts walking down the street with tights underneath; hoodies like the one that made Mike look like black Jesus; full-dress couture kicks; fashion designers making like they\u0027ve got a team and you\u0027ve got a number, too. It\u0027s all the legacy of a man who could fly. No, money—not Icarus. MJ. Air.",

And as Glenn O&#39;Brien explains, Jordan&#39;s influence on fashion may have been even greater <em>off</em> the court</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.0"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583e4333655c24c6c971d4d/master/w_806/style-2015-03-sip-michael-jordan-sip-jordan-05.jpg" alt="style-2015-03-sip-michael-jordan-sip-jordan-05.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmichael-jordan&amp;t=style-2015-03-sip-michael-jordan-sip-jordan-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmichael-jordan&amp;t=style-2015-03-sip-michael-jordan-sip-jordan-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmichael-jordan&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583e4333655c24c6c971d4d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2015-03-sip-michael-jordan-sip-jordan-05.jpg&amp;description=style-2015-03-sip-michael-jordan-sip-jordan-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmichael-jordan&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583e4333655c24c6c971d4d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2015-03-sip-michael-jordan-sip-jordan-05.jpg&amp;description=style-2015-03-sip-michael-jordan-sip-jordan-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Lane Stewart/ Getty</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.1"> <a href="http://www.gq.com/style/201503/michael-jordans-most-influential-style-moves"><strong> Michael Jordan&#x2019;s Most Influential Style Moves</strong></a></p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.2">Michael Jordan was cute. I swear. Before he got the HeadBlade dome and the landing strip on his upper lip for a Hanes commercial, before he got his ear pierced back when he was 18 and the new face on Dean Smith&#x2019;s UNC Tar Heels&#x2014;he was a cute kid. Boyish. His childhood nickname was Rabbit; his ears stuck out. He hadn&#x2019;t made high school varsity until he was a junior. Back then, he was on the short side for hoops. But then the pituitary kicked in and the world changed.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.3">I first really noticed Michael Jordan when the freshman&#x2019;s jumper put North Carolina up one point over Georgetown with seventeen seconds left in the 1982 NCAA championship game. As a crazed Hoya alum, I wasn&#x2019;t panicked&#x2014;hey, we had All-American shooting guard Sleepy Floyd (who would go on to thirteen pro seasons) and a freshman named Patrick Ewing, who had already scored twenty-three points in the game. But then, like in a nightmare, Georgetown point guard Fred Brown inexplicably passed the ball to the Tar Heels&#x2019; James Worthy, and Jordan&#x2019;s shot turned into the game winner. Michael Jordan and James Worthy... I would remember those names.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.5">Worthy, who scored twenty-eight in the game, looked like a man, with sad eyes and a full beard. Jordan looked like a skinny punk with his tongue wagging out of his mouth. But he played like a demon, and he was an All-American the next two seasons before forgoing his senior year to enter the NBA draft, going number three to the Bulls. The rest is history. Mike averaged twenty-eight points in his first season, made the All-Star team, and was Rookie of the Year.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.6">The two freshman stars of the &#x2019;82 championship game both changed basketball style. Ewing wore a T-shirt under his uniform, because he was always complaining about being cold in big arenas, and it caught on throughout college basketball with help from fellow frosh Chris Mullin. When Ewing went to the Knicks, he wanted to continue wearing a tee, but NBA rules wouldn&#x2019;t allow it. Eventually the undershirt trend faded.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.7">Jordan&#x2019;s impact came a bit later, but it endured. In 1984, Nike put him under contract and then introduced the Air Jordan, the most expensive basketball shoe ever made. The first model was black, white, and red, violating the NBA&#x2019;s rules and getting Jordan fined $5,000 for every game he wore them. Nike paid the bill all the way to the bank. Jordan was wearing his red-white-and-black Air Jordans when he scored sixty-three points against the Celtics in an &#x2019;86 playoff game. In 1989, with his hair receding, he shaved his head clean. Jordan&#x2014;who wore his North Carolina team shorts under his Chicago Bulls shorts and thus needed some extra room&#x2014;also asked that Champion give him a wider, longer pair. Jordan&#x2019;s teammate Scottie Pippen liked them so much he asked for the same. And so baggies came to the NBA, and thence to the Runnin&#x2019; Rebels of UNLV, the Fab Five of Michigan, and then the world. (Except John Stockton.)</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.8">Off the court, the young Michael Jordan always exhibited good taste&#x2014;the right polo, the right jeans, the right sweatshirt, hey, even a rugby shirt. It was only later, as a multi-millionaire, that his moves may have been a bit off. He was always fashionable, but fashion itself goes wrong sometimes, and one of those times came at the height of his career: in the &#x2019;90s, when Italian suits ruled the world. Remember Pat Riley cavorting on the sidelines, with his hair gel and his suits with the huge shoulders and the blousy pleated pants? Jordan wore similar suits (but no gel or hair), and in post-game interviews he sometimes resembled a cross between Dr. Evil and the character with the tiny head in <em>Beetlejuice.</em></p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.9">But Jordan&#x2019;s head was a thing of beauty. Bald men everywhere should worship him as a god for making the bald head manly and totemic. Sure, there was Yul Brynner as the petulant King of Siam, and Telly Savalas as Kojak&#x2014;whom many menopausal women considered the sexiest man alive&#x2014;but Jordan was like a hairless Hercules, a superman with a noble pate that made him look stronger than Samson, grinning like a death&#x2019;s-head at the opponents he would dunk over. Taking flight, His Airness made hair seem un-aerodynamic. Like bad design. Jordan&#x2019;s baldness made him as changeless as a sculpture. Monumental. Without Michael Jordan, there would be no Ving Rhames, no hair-free Samuel L. Jackson, no chrome-domed Shaquille O&#x2019;Neal, no cue-ball Kobe, no glabrescent Vin Diesel. Without Michael Jordan, there <em>is</em> a toupee industry. Without Michael Jordan, there is <em>no</em> sneaker industry. And the streetwear movement that has journeyed from asphalt basketball courts to Paris runways would never have been the same without number 23.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.a">When Nike&#x2019;s Air Jordans shattered the price ceiling on sneakers and hit three figures, sportswriters went ballistic, seeing the luxury-kicks market as a crime wave waiting to happen. Today the Jordan Shine model goes for $400 and nobody flinches. Nike&#x2019;s Air Yeezy Red October model is going for three to five grand on eBay.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.b">But it all started with Mike. Remember the Nike ad with Spike Lee (as <em>She&#x2019;s Gotta Have It</em> protagonist Mars Blackmon) questioning Jordan?</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>MB:</strong> What makes you the best player in the universe? Is it the vicious dunks?</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>MJ:</strong> No, Mars.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>MB:</strong> Is it the haircut?</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>MJ:</strong> No, Mars.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>MB:</strong> Is it the shoes?</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>MJ:</strong> No, Mars.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>MB:</strong> Is it the extra-long shorts?</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>MJ:</strong> No, Mars.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>MB:</strong> It&#x2019;s the shoes, then, right?</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>MJ:</strong> Nah.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>MB:</strong> Is it the short socks?</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>MJ:</strong> No, Mars.</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>MB:</strong> Money, it&#x2019;s gotta be the shoes!</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.p">MJ never fesses up to exactly what it is that makes him the best player in the universe. But there&#x2019;s no doubt in his self-assured, chiding replies that style is the essence of greatestness, just like it was when the O.G. Dr. J was the best player in the universe, with his windmill facials. Is it the goatee, Doctor? Is it the &#x2019;fro, Doctor?</p><p data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.4.q">Style is something that comes with the territory&#x2014;with the ability to improvise in any situation and beat the shot clock of the universe. The juke, the hesitation, the pump fake, the fadeaway. Michael Jordan&#x2019;s sartorial style just came from within, like his moves on the court. The Zeitgeist flows from the heroes. And so it goes, two decades on. Big-ass shorts walking down the street with tights underneath; hoodies like the one that made Mike look like black Jesus; full-dress couture kicks; fashion designers making like they&#x2019;ve got a team and you&#x2019;ve got a number, too. It&#x2019;s all the legacy of a man who could fly. No, money&#x2014;not Icarus. MJ. Air.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15" data-reactid=".1yvi56o8s1s.1.1.0.0.5.0.0"><div
