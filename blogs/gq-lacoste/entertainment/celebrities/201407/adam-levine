  	    "articleBody": "\u0022Okay. Let\u0027s get into this: What are the characteristics of a douchebag?\u0022 says Adam Levine, pushing aside the remains of his egg-white omelet. We\u0027re sitting at Blu Jam, a diner near where he lives in the nondescript Los Angeles suburbs. We\u0027ve been discussing his role in Begin Again, the new movie musical in which he plays a character kinda like Adam Levine: a talented, ambitious indie musician who, after achieving mainstream success, starts acting a little bit like a, well...you know. \u0022Let\u0027s define this,\u0022 says Levine, turning on that twinkly-eyed smile, the one that has brought many a groupie to her knees. At 35, Levine\u0027s face is still boyish, the biceps peeking out of his red Hawaiian shirt formidably toned. Later someone will post a sneaky cell-phone photo of this exact moment on Twitter, and a fan will comment: \u0022Damnnn.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022A douchebag is a really specific thing,\u0022 he says. \u0022Okay?\u0022\u000A\u000AThe waiter comes over.\u000A\u000A\u0022We\u0027re talking about douchebags,\u0022 Levine tells him.\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, okay,\u0022 the waiter says. \u0022That\u0027s a long conversation.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022No shit!\u0022 Levine says. \u0022I just said the same thing.\u0022\u000A\u000AAdam Levine is one of the biggest pop stars in the country, if not the world. Along with his band, Maroon 5, he\u0027s responsible for some of the most ubiquitous earworms of the past decade, songs like \u0022This Love\u0022 and \u0022Moves Like Jagger,\u0022 one of which you\u0027re probably humming right now just by virtue of having read the words. His enthusiastic coaching of aspiring singers on The Voice has made Levine a household name. He has his own microphone-shaped fragrance and a clothing line at Kmart selling faster than you can say \u0022Coachella-inspired,\u0022 and he has deployed his considerable personality to sell acne medication, smartphones, and of course, his own music. In 2012, 5 million people downloaded Maroon 5\u0027s \u0022Payphone,\u0022 a fact that is especially impressive when you consider most of them probably don\u0027t even know what a pay phone is.\u000A\u000AAnd yet.\u000A\u000A\u0022Douchebag,\u0022 Adam Levine says. \u0022What is a douchebag?\u0022 Well. The thing is, there are a number of people who might say a douchebag is Adam Levine. Have said it, in fact. There it is, right in a BuzzFeed headline: \u0022Adam Levine Is the Definition of \u0027Hot Douche.\u0027 \u0022 One could argue that on the Internet, everyone is being called a douchebag by someone. But perhaps more so than it is for any other celebrity, the word douchebag and its variants are applied to Adam Levine in an almost proprietary way. (\u0022Lord of the Douche,\u0022 one blog calls him; another refers to him as \u0022a ridiculous douchenozzle.\u0022) Last year, when People magazine named him the Sexiest Man Alive, even the website Jezebel, which had in the past creatively avoided the D-word by dubbing him \u0022the human equivalent of testing positive for chlamydia,\u0022 called it \u0022a stunning victory for douchebags everywhere.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Polo Sweater: Salvatore Ferragamo. Pants: Gucci. Belt: Brunello Cucinelli. Shoes: Johnston &amp; Murphy. Watch: Rolex. Golf Glove: G/Fore.\u000A\u000ASo far, in my experience, Levine has been perfectly pleasant. Delightful, even. He is quick and witty and unfailingly polite. But there are arguments to be made: He put a grand piano in his bedroom. He rose to fame on a song in which he basically describes fingering his ex-girlfriend. He appeared on Lindsay Lohan\u0027s Sex List. He once told a reporter yoga was good for \u0022fuuuuck-ing,\u0022 while thrusting his hips around on a private jet. He makes the kind of music, catchy but deeply uncool, that people hate themselves for singing along to. Not long after our interview, he will dye his hair Eminem blond and tweet a picture of it, making a face that is unironically Blue Steel.\u000A\u000A\u0022Would it be really easy to assume that I was a douchebag?\u0022 he says. \u0022Definitely. One hundred percent. But that doesn\u0027t mean that I am.\u0022 He thinks for a minute. \u0022Or maybe I am, I don\u0027t know.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe takes a long sip of green juice. \u0022Okay,\u0022 he says. \u0022So I\u0027m gonna get really intricately self-reflective right now and ask myself the hard questions, to find out, once and for all, definitively, whether or not I\u0027m a douchebag.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ABefore he can embark on this soul-searching, the hostess approaches us. \u0022I\u0027m so sorry?\u0022 she says. \u0022But I just wanted to let you know, there is a bunch of paparazzi outside?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Really?\u0022 Levine says, sounding genuinely surprised. Earlier, he had extolled the virtues of living in the Valley. \u0022No one ever follows me,\u0022 he\u0027d said as we drove in his black Ferrari through a landscape of foot-massage parlors and nail salons. \u0022Because, truthfully, it\u0027s not the most desirable place for a lot of people to go.\u0022\u000A\u000AAttention is not something Levine shirks. (\u0022I love attention\u0022 is one of the quotes on BuzzFeed\u0027s \u002215 Quotes to Remind You That Adam Levine Is Still a Douche.\u0022) But he prefers it to be on his terms. \u0022Every part of my being is allergic to walking out of a place and seeing them,\u0022 he says of the paparazzi. Then he cheers up. \u0022It\u0027s fun if you look at it like a spy movie,\u0022 he says. \u0022 \u0027We\u0027re trapped in here! How do we get out?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AHe picks up his phone. \u0022Hey, bro,\u0022 he says to his assistant, Shawn. \u0022So there\u0027s like 7,000 paparazzi outside. Maybe two of you guys can roll over, and one of you can grab the Ferrari, and then we can just split? Thanks, bro.\u0022 He clicks off, and a few minutes later, Shawn, a gentle lion of a man with a Jesus ponytail, has pulled up outside and hustled us into his Dodge Magnum.\u000A\u000A\u0022Shawn, are you experiencing inordinate amounts of pain?\u0022 Levine asks as we pull out of the parking lot. Levine recently became engaged, and over the past few days, in preparation for his wedding, he, Shawn, and some of his other guy friends have been doing P90X-style workouts together.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m a little sore,\u0022 says Shawn. \u0022I feel like I\u0027m already buffer. I think three days is enough.\u0022\u000A\u000ALevine laughs. \u0022You gotta start your own workout program and call it \u0027Three Days Is Enough.\u0027 \u0022 He swivels his head as we pass a strip mall. \u0022Oh, I guess the hearing-aid store went out of business,\u0022 he says. \u0022That\u0027s a shame.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022We should get that space and open a store,\u0022 says Shawn.\u000A\u000A\u0022We should totally open a store,\u0022 says Levine with conviction. \u0022What kind of store?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Just random shit. Like a mix between like a liquor store and like a pharmacy and like a...a pizzeria. We\u0027d have tacos.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022We would have weed, tacos, and some clothes, and some golf stuff. We\u0027d call it Weed and Golf,\u0022 Levine says.\u000A\u000A\u0022And Tacos,\u0022 adds Shawn.\u000A\u000A\u0022I like tacos,\u0022 Levine says happily as we pull up to the house, a big white wedding cake of a compound whose past occupants include Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards. It\u0027s a rental—Levine and his bros are only living in it until contractors complete work on a place for him and his fiancée, supermodel Behati Prinsloo. \u0022These are kind of the last days of the frat house,\u0022 he says, waxing nostalgic about the costume parties, and the toga party, and the gigantic pirate party, after which they kept finding swords and eye patches and gold coins at the bottom of the pool for weeks. He grabs a coconut water from the fridge and gingerly eases his body onto a floral-upholstered bench in the breakfast nook. The house came fully furnished by its owner, a Famous TV Personality who favors the English country style and anything with inspirational wisdom printed on it. Levine\u0027s only contribution to the decor is a plaque above the sink, a gift from his former Voice colleague CeeLo Green, sentimentally inscribed THE ONLY REASON I WOULD KICK YOU OUT OF BED IS TO FUCK YOU ON THE FLOOR.\u000A\u000AA cleaning lady brushes by with a bucket. \u0022You know what the greatest thing about what\u0027s happened to me is?\u0022 Levine says. \u0022I don\u0027t have to do my own laundry. I\u0027d always think to myself, I can\u0027t wait for the time when I don\u0027t have to do laundry anymore.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ATo be clear: Nothing just \u0022happened\u0022 to Adam Levine. Maintaining his level of stadium-filling, heart-palpitating, cash-money-making stardom for a dozen years is not something that just happens. In fact, people who act like fame and fortune just found them are kind of a pet peeve of his. \u0022\u0027Oh yeah, this just happened, man, I didn\u0027t try at all,\u0027 \u0022 he says mockingly. \u0022It\u0027s total nonsense.\u0022\u000A\u000ALevine is talented. \u0022He sounds Autotuned even when he isn\u0027t,\u0022 says his guitarist, James Valentine. But becoming a mega pop star at a time when that isn\u0027t even supposed to be possible takes work.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ve worked hard,\u0022 he says, \u0022but I\u0027ve also had a lot of wonderful things happen to me. I haven\u0027t been dealt a hard hand.\u0022 This, Levine reckons, is probably his Original Douche Sin: \u0022I\u0027m not an easy guy to root for.\u0022\u000A\u000AConsider the insanely easy big break of his first band, which Levine and his friends formed as teenagers in Brentwood, the wealthy Beverly Hills-ish enclave where he went to school. \u0022It\u0027s actually—it\u0027s ridiculous,\u0022 says Mickey Madden, Maroon 5\u0027s bassist, about the discovery of the band that was then called Kara\u0027s Flowers. He describes a scene that sounds straight out of Beverly Hills, 90210: \u0022We were playing at a house party in Malibu. I guess we were freshmen or sophomores in high school. And this producer was like literally walking his dog and heard us, and he came in and watched the show.\u0022 The next thing they knew, they were on the actual 90210, performing at the Peach Pit and getting excused early from class so they could go into the studio with the guy who produced Green Day. But their album flopped. \u0022We were shitty,\u0022 says Levine. \u0022We were like a shitty version of Weezer, you know, trying to be alternative radio.\u0022\u000A\u000AStill, he felt, the band was destined for success. It\u0027s not like he believes in \u0022The Secret or all that bullshit, which is total bullshit,\u0022 he says, but \u0022energetically, I always felt really positive, like good things were going to happen.\u0022 All his band had to figure out was what kind of band they were going to be. \u0022It\u0027s funny to listen to their recordings from back then,\u0022 says Valentine, who joined the band in 2001, around the time they changed their name to Maroon 5. \u0022Adam was trying to sing like Eddie Vedder, which is funny, because Adam is not a baritone. Then they went through a Green Day sort of punk phase. Then they went way out and were into a Britpop period. And then they had a weird left turn into like jam-band stuff, like Phish and Dave Matthews Band.\u0022 Then Levine discovered Stevie Wonder and had a kind of revelation. Like Stevie, he has a high-pitched register, a voice that, he found, was best suited to bouncy, Motown-inflected pop.\u000A\u000AWhen Maroon 5 debuted their new, funky, Stevie-inspired sound, their fans and friends in what Valentine calls \u0022cool bands\u0022 were horrified. Not only was the music vaguely embarrassing in the way it always is when a skinny white guy imitates Michael Jackson; it was the kind of music you could imagine being played in a rock block with Britney Spears, not on KROQ. It sounded, suspiciously, like they were trying to be successful.\u000A\u000AWhich they were. \u0022I wanted to become a successful musician,\u0022 Levine says now. \u0022It wasn\u0027t like now, when kids are like, \u0027I want to be a famous slut. Or whatever I can possibly be famous for.\u0027 I wanted to be a famous musician.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s hard to remember, but this was in a time when being a slacker was something to aspire to. Saying you wanted to be successful was like announcing that you loved hair metal or shopping at Structure. Sure, lots of people did, but it wasn\u0027t cool. \u0022That\u0027s the \u002790s in a nutshell,\u0022 says Levine. \u0022Oh, you can\u0027t, like, try. \u0027Oh, no, I could never pursue mass worldwide success! No, that wouldn\u0027t be cool.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ABetween the irresistible pop hooks, Levine\u0027s boy-band good looks, and the borderline-filthy lyrics, Maroon 5\u0027s first album went over with the Top 40-consuming public like Fifty Shades of Grey at an administrative-assistants convention.\u000A\u000AWhen the album went triple platinum, Levine pretty much reacted the way anyone who has spent twenty-five years dreaming of being a rock star might. He moved into the Chateau Marmont, where rumor had it he personally auditioned every celebutante crotch flashed in the mid-aughts: Lohan, Jessica Simpson, Paris Hilton, and sundry other blondes. \u0022Maybe,\u0022 he told an interviewer about why he slept with so many women, \u0022the reason I was promiscuous is that I love them so much.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Um, all right,\u0022 says Levine when presented with this evidence pointing toward douchehood. \u0022All of a sudden, I had money in my bank account. I hadn\u0027t had a break in a long time. And I went a little fucking nuts. You know? And good,\u0022 he adds defensively. \u0022I deserved to go a little bit nuts. And I had the time of my life.\u0022 Fair enough. But dude: I love women?\u000A\u000A\u0022I didn\u0027t say it like that,\u0022 he protests. \u0022I didn\u0027t say it like Fabio.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe flops back and props a pillow under his head. \u0022Men are not as sophisticated as women,\u0022 he goes on. \u0022They\u0027re not as mature as women. They\u0027re not as connected with their emotions as women. There\u0027s a very Neanderthal quality that still exists in a lot of men. There\u0027s the carnal shit you can\u0027t deny. And if you\u0027re in the public eye, to me, it\u0027s very boring to say what you have to say and be media trained to the extent that you don\u0027t ever reveal any truth. There was a time in my life when I lived probably a bit more on the primal level. And it was amazing.\u0022\u000A\u000AEver since these youthful indiscretions, Levine has been doing what feels like a long walk of shame. \u0022That was kind of the foundation of all the negative shit I still get,\u0022 he posits. \u0022I was out there having fun, you know. I didn\u0027t give a shit, and I got burned for it.\u0022 He goes to the fridge, opens another bottle of coconut water, and chugs it. \u0022People change; people grow up, get more self-aware and in tune with all this shit.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd his recent birthday, he says, made him more in tune with all this shit. \u0022Being 35, as a dude, is basically the time in your life where you say, \u0027Am I gonna be a kid for twenty more years? Or am I gonna be a grown-up?\u0027 \u0022 he says. \u0022It\u0027s almost like you think to yourself, God, you know, I don\u0027t want to be a 50-year-old dude trolling around a club in L.A.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen it comes to his fiancée, Behati Prinsloo, Levine is clearly besotted. \u0022She\u0027s the coolest person in the world,\u0022 he says. But it is also true that \u0022B,\u0022 as he calls her, is the third Victoria\u0027s Secret model he has dated in five years, another data point that lends credence to the image of him as what the Los Angeles Times calls \u0022a sexy creep.\u0022\u000A\u000AAt mention of \u0022the model thing,\u0022 as he puts it, Levine\u0027s hackles are raised. \u0022I don\u0027t date what the person does,\u0022 he says. \u0022I date the fucking person. You know what I mean? I could have been a zitty teenager and walked into a Tower Records, and we would have talked about Pearl Jam, and we would have fallen in love when we were 15. And that\u0027s when you know. It\u0027s like, oh, my God, game over.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd if he had to date \u0022the entire Victoria\u0027s Secret catalog,\u0022 as his Voice co-star Carson Daly put it, to find her? \u0022So what?\u0022 Levine says, unscrewing another coconut water.\u000A\u000A\u0022Preference should never be looked down upon,\u0022 he opines. \u0022Unless it\u0027s based on something really shitty. I\u0027m not saying I have a preference, but like, I want to date someone... Listen, there are a lot of women in this country, in many countries, who date men for their money. Okay? That\u0027s despicable. Right? That\u0027s not what we\u0027re talking about here. Whatever does it for you, man. I don\u0027t like feet. You know what I mean? But some people do. Some people have fucking foot fetishes. And it\u0027s weird to me. But I don\u0027t have to deal with it, because I don\u0027t have that. You know?\u0022\u000A\u000AHe stands up. \u0022You know what I\u0027m saying, man,\u0022 he says. \u0022It\u0027ll all make sense somehow.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHe heads to the bathroom to process all the coconut waters, leaving me to ponder these deep questions alone. Back at the diner, he\u0027d come up with three indicators of douchiness. A lack of self-awareness. \u0022That\u0027s big,\u0022 he said. Levine is definitely self-aware. Arrogance. \u0022I\u0027m not arrogant,\u0022 he protested. \u0022I\u0027m cocky. It\u0027s different. Cocky is playful.\u0022 The third was insecurity. \u0022Or masking deep insecurity with too much security,\u0022 he said. Arguably, posing naked on the cover of a Russian magazine with his last Victoria\u0027s Secret model girlfriend could fit the bill. But it doesn\u0027t really. \u0022I\u0027m confident,\u0022 he said. \u0022Some people don\u0027t like confidence. They resent confidence.\u0022 This is true, and it may be the main reason Levine is so often slapped with the douchebag label. Modern celebrities are supposed to be hiding cellulite and driving Priuses, not driving flamboyant Ferraris and dating models and exposing extremely enviable, well-toned abs. Even though all those things, like weed and tacos, are objectively awesome. It\u0027s not cool.\u000A\u000A\u0022He\u0027s very defiant in doing a lot of the things that make him happy,\u0022 says Valentine. \u0022Like, \u0027I want to live the life I want to and I am not going to feel any guilt about it.\u0027 And other people don\u0027t really want to root for a guy like that.\u0022\u000A\u000AJust as, back in the \u002790s, when Levine violated the rules of budding rock stardom by acknowledging his ambition, he has since broken the Just Like Us vow of celebrity: Never act like you are having too much fun. \u0022Every day,\u0022 he\u0027d said to me, \u0022every single day, at some point, I think to myself, this is so great. It\u0027s so much fun.\u0022\u000A\u000ANow Levine returns from the bathroom. \u0022You know what the gist of this article is?\u0022 he says. \u0022Your opening line can be: \u0027You don\u0027t have to like me, but I\u0027d prefer it if you did.\u0027 That\u0027s kind of how I feel. I\u0027m not the easiest person to love right off the bat, you know. If I knew everyone in the world, they would love me. Every single last fucking one of them.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AA morning session of yoga at the Mercer hotel has loosened up his P90X\u0027ed body and left Levine limber enough to be able to give a small wave to the Maroon 5 fans clustered outside the red carpet at the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of Begin Again. \u0022Ow,\u0022 he moans a little, under their deafening screeches.\u000A\u000AIn the film, Levine plays Dave, a struggling singer-songwriter who becomes an overnight success. At first, says the director, John Carney, \u0022it felt a bit stunty\u0022 to cast Levine in the role. But he says Levine was actually pretty good at making the character, who cheats on his indie-singer girlfriend, played by Keira Knightley, and ultimately chooses the wide world of rock stardom over their small life together, seem sympathetic. \u0022He wasn\u0027t totally black-and-white, you know, and a lot of that is due to Adam,\u0022 says Carney. \u0022You see him being tempted by these things he comes across, and you understand why it\u0027s appealing. Even as you sort of want to strangle him.\u0022\u000A\u000ALevine skips the screening—he\u0027s already seen the movie (\u0022I was surprised at how not-sucky I was,\u0022 he says)—and instead has a meeting with his managers about doing more film work. Then, at the afterparty at Tribeca Grill, he and Behati Prinsloo are wrapped around each other in a banquette, giggling, when Levine\u0027s publicist interrupts. Bill de Blasio, the newly elected mayor of New York City, wants to meet him. Levine untangles himself and turns on his twinkliest smile. \u0022You were great,\u0022 the mayor tells him. \u0022You really inhabited the role.\u0022 Then the mayor puts on a stern look and mock scolds him over the douche sins of his character. \u0022I\u0027m still kind of pissed off at you, to be honest,\u0022 he says, laughing. \u0022What a jerk you are!\u0022\u000A\u000ALevine keeps twinkling, but now his eyes have narrowed ever so slightly. After all, his character just wanted to be successful. What\u0027s so bad about that?\u000A\u000AJESSICA PRESSLER profiled Matthew McConaughey for the December 2013 issue of GQ.",

We&#x2019;re sitting at Blu Jam, a diner near where he lives in the nondescript Los Angeles suburbs. We&#x2019;ve been discussing his role in <em>Begin Again,</em> the new movie musical in which he plays a character kinda like Adam Levine: a talented, ambitious indie musician who, after achieving mainstream success, starts acting a little bit like a, well...you know. &quot;Let&#x2019;s define this,&quot; says Levine, turning on that twinkly-eyed smile, the one that has brought many a groupie to her knees. At 35, Levine&#x2019;s face is still boyish, the biceps peeking out of his red Hawaiian shirt formidably toned. Later someone will post a sneaky cell-phone photo of this exact moment on Twitter, and a fan will comment: <em>&quot;Damnnn.&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1">&quot;A douchebag is a really specific thing,&quot; he says. &quot;Okay?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.2">The waiter comes over.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.3">&quot;We&#x2019;re talking about douchebags,&quot; Levine tells him.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.5">&quot;Oh, okay,&quot; the waiter says. &quot;That&#x2019;s a long conversation.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.6">&quot;No shit!&quot; Levine says. &quot;I just said the same thing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.7">Adam Levine is one of the biggest pop stars in the country, if not the world. Along with his band, Maroon 5, he&#x2019;s responsible for some of the most ubiquitous earworms of the past decade, songs like &quot;This Love&quot; and &quot;Moves Like Jagger,&quot; one of which you&#x2019;re probably humming right now just by virtue of having read the words. His enthusiastic coaching of aspiring singers on <em>The Voice</em> has made Levine a household name. He has his own microphone-shaped fragrance and a clothing line at Kmart selling faster than you can say &quot;Coachella-inspired,&quot; and he has deployed his considerable personality to sell acne medication, smartphones, and of course, his own music. In 2012, 5 million people downloaded Maroon 5&#x2019;s &quot;Payphone,&quot; a fact that is especially impressive when you consider most of them probably <em>don&#x2019;t even know what a pay phone is.</em></p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.8">And yet.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.9">&quot;<em>Douche</em>bag,&quot; Adam Levine says. &quot;What <em>is</em> a douchebag?&quot; Well. The thing is, there are a number of people who might say a douchebag is Adam Levine. <em>Have</em> said it, in fact. There it is, right in a BuzzFeed headline: &quot;Adam Levine Is the Definition of &#x2019;Hot Douche.&#x2019; &quot; One could argue that on the Internet, everyone is being called a douchebag by someone. But perhaps more so than it is for any other celebrity, the word <em>douchebag</em> and its variants are applied to Adam Levine in an almost proprietary way. (&quot;Lord of the Douche,&quot; one blog calls him; another refers to him as &quot;a ridiculous douchenozzle.&quot;) Last year, when <em>People</em> magazine named him the Sexiest Man Alive, even the website Jezebel, which had in the past creatively avoided the D-word by dubbing him &quot;the human equivalent of testing positive for chlamydia,&quot; called it &quot;a stunning victory for douchebags everywhere.&quot;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.a"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582cea6e52bc4b477a9e36a/master/w_600/entertainment-2014-07-adam-levine-adam-levine-gq-magazine-july-2014-douche-02.jpg" alt="entertainment-2014-07-adam-levine-adam-levine-gq-magazine-july-2014-douche-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fadam-levine&amp;t=entertainment-2014-07-adam-levine-adam-levine-gq-magazine-july-2014-douche-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fadam-levine&amp;t=entertainment-2014-07-adam-levine-adam-levine-gq-magazine-july-2014-douche-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fadam-levine&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582cea6e52bc4b477a9e36a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-07-adam-levine-adam-levine-gq-magazine-july-2014-douche-02.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-07-adam-levine-adam-levine-gq-magazine-july-2014-douche-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fadam-levine&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582cea6e52bc4b477a9e36a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-07-adam-levine-adam-levine-gq-magazine-july-2014-douche-02.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-07-adam-levine-adam-levine-gq-magazine-july-2014-douche-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.b"> <em>Polo Sweater: Salvatore Ferragamo.

Golf Glove: G/Fore.</em></p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.c">So far, in my experience, Levine has been perfectly pleasant. Delightful, even. He is quick and witty and unfailingly polite. But there <em>are</em> arguments to be made: He put a grand piano in his bedroom. He rose to fame on a song in which he basically describes fingering his ex-girlfriend. He appeared on Lindsay Lohan&#x2019;s Sex List. He once told a reporter yoga was good for &quot;fuuuuck-ing,&quot; while thrusting his hips around on a private jet. He makes the kind of music, catchy but deeply uncool, that people hate themselves for singing along to. Not long after our interview, he will dye his hair Eminem blond and tweet a picture of it, making a face that is unironically Blue Steel.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.d">&quot;Would it be really easy to assume that I was a douchebag?&quot; he says. &quot;Definitely. One hundred percent. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean that I <em>am.</em>&quot; He thinks for a minute. &quot;Or maybe I am, I don&#x2019;t know.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.e">He takes a long sip of green juice. &quot;Okay,&quot; he says. &quot;So I&#x2019;m gonna get really intricately self-reflective right now and ask myself the hard questions, to find out, once and for all, definitively, whether or not I&#x2019;m a douchebag.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.f"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.g">Before he can embark on this soul-searching, the hostess approaches us. &quot;I&#x2019;m so sorry?&quot; she says. &quot;But I just wanted to let you know, there is a bunch of paparazzi outside?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.h">&quot;Really?&quot; Levine says, sounding genuinely surprised. Earlier, he had extolled the virtues of living in the Valley. &quot;No one ever follows me,&quot; he&#x2019;d said as we drove in his black Ferrari through a landscape of foot-massage parlors and nail salons. &quot;Because, truthfully, it&#x2019;s not the most desirable place for a lot of people to go.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.i">Attention is not something Levine shirks. (&quot;I love attention&quot; is one of the quotes on BuzzFeed&#x2019;s &quot;15 Quotes to Remind You That Adam Levine Is Still a Douche.&quot;) But he prefers it to be on his terms. &quot;Every part of my being is allergic to walking out of a place and seeing them,&quot; he says of the paparazzi. Then he cheers up. &quot;It&#x2019;s fun if you look at it like a spy movie,&quot; he says. &quot; &#x2019;We&#x2019;re trapped in here! How do we get out?&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.j">He picks up his phone. &quot;Hey, bro,&quot; he says to his assistant, Shawn. &quot;So there&#x2019;s like 7,000 paparazzi outside. Maybe two of you guys can roll over, and one of you can grab the Ferrari, and then we can just split? Thanks, bro.&quot; He clicks off, and a few minutes later, Shawn, a gentle lion of a man with a Jesus ponytail, has pulled up outside and hustled us into his Dodge Magnum.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.k">&quot;Shawn, are you experiencing inordinate amounts of pain?&quot; Levine asks as we pull out of the parking lot. Levine recently became engaged, and over the past few days, in preparation for his wedding, he, Shawn, and some of his other guy friends have been doing P90X-style workouts together.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.l">&quot;I&#x2019;m a little sore,&quot; says Shawn. &quot;I feel like I&#x2019;m already buffer. I think three days is enough.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.m">Levine laughs. &quot;You gotta start your own workout program and call it &#x2019;Three Days Is Enough.&#x2019; &quot; He swivels his head as we pass a strip mall. &quot;Oh, I guess the hearing-aid store went out of business,&quot; he says. &quot;That&#x2019;s a shame.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.n">&quot;We should get that space and open a store,&quot; says Shawn.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.o">&quot;We should totally open a store,&quot; says Levine with conviction. &quot;What kind of store?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.p">&quot;Just random shit. Like a mix between like a liquor store and like a pharmacy and like a...a pizzeria. We&#x2019;d have tacos.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.q">&quot;We would have weed, tacos, and some clothes, and some golf stuff. We&#x2019;d call it Weed and Golf,&quot; Levine says.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.r">&quot;And Tacos,&quot; adds Shawn.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.s">&quot;I like tacos,&quot; Levine says happily as we pull up to the house, a big white wedding cake of a compound whose past occupants include Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards. It&#x2019;s a rental&#x2014;Levine and his bros are only living in it until contractors complete work on a place for him and his fianc&#xE9;e, supermodel Behati Prinsloo. &quot;These are kind of the last days of the frat house,&quot; he says, waxing nostalgic about the costume parties, and the toga party, and the gigantic pirate party, after which they kept finding swords and eye patches and gold coins at the bottom of the pool for weeks. He grabs a coconut water from the fridge and gingerly eases his body onto a floral-upholstered bench in the breakfast nook. The house came fully furnished by its owner, a Famous TV Personality who favors the English country style and anything with inspirational wisdom printed on it. Levine&#x2019;s only contribution to the decor is a plaque above the sink, a gift from his former <em>Voice</em> colleague CeeLo Green, sentimentally inscribed THE ONLY REASON I WOULD KICK YOU OUT OF BED IS TO FUCK YOU ON THE FLOOR.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.t">A cleaning lady brushes by with a bucket. &quot;You know what the greatest thing about what&#x2019;s happened to me is?&quot; Levine says. &quot;I don&#x2019;t have to do my own laundry. I&#x2019;d always think to myself, <em>I can&#x2019;t wait for the time when I don&#x2019;t have to do laundry anymore.</em>&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.u"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.v">To be clear: Nothing just &quot;happened&quot; to Adam Levine. Maintaining his level of stadium-filling, heart-palpitating, cash-money-making stardom for a <em>dozen years</em> is not something that just <em>happens.</em> In fact, people who act like fame and fortune just found them are kind of a pet peeve of his. &quot;&#x2019;Oh yeah, this just <em>happened,</em> man, I didn&#x2019;t try at all,&#x2019; &quot; he says mockingly. &quot;It&#x2019;s total nonsense.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.w">Levine is talented. &quot;He sounds Autotuned even when he isn&#x2019;t,&quot; says his guitarist, James Valentine. But becoming a mega pop star at a time when that isn&#x2019;t even supposed to be possible takes <em>work.</em></p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.x">&quot;I&#x2019;ve worked hard,&quot; he says, &quot;but I&#x2019;ve also had a lot of wonderful things happen to me. I haven&#x2019;t been dealt a hard hand.&quot; This, Levine reckons, is probably his Original Douche Sin: &quot;I&#x2019;m not an easy guy to root for.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.y">Consider the insanely easy big break of his first band, which Levine and his friends formed as teenagers in Brentwood, the wealthy Beverly Hills-ish enclave where he went to school. &quot;It&#x2019;s actually&#x2014;it&#x2019;s ridiculous,&quot; says Mickey Madden, Maroon 5&#x2019;s bassist, about the discovery of the band that was then called Kara&#x2019;s Flowers. He describes a scene that sounds straight out of <em>Beverly Hills, 90210:</em> &quot;We were playing at a house party in Malibu. I guess we were freshmen or sophomores in high school. And this producer was like literally walking his dog and heard us, and he came in and watched the show.&quot; The next thing they knew, they were on the actual <em>90210,</em> performing at the Peach Pit and getting excused early from class so they could go into the studio with the guy who produced Green Day. But their album flopped. &quot;We were shitty,&quot; says Levine. &quot;We were like a shitty version of Weezer, you know, trying to be alternative radio.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.z">Still, he felt, the band was destined for success. It&#x2019;s not like he believes in &quot;The Secret or all that bullshit, which is total bullshit,&quot; he says, but &quot;energetically, I always felt really positive, like good things were going to happen.&quot; All his band had to figure out was what kind of band they were going to be. &quot;It&#x2019;s funny to listen to their recordings from back then,&quot; says Valentine, who joined the band in 2001, around the time they changed their name to Maroon 5. &quot;Adam was trying to sing like Eddie Vedder, which is funny, because Adam is <em>not</em> a baritone. Then they went through a Green Day sort of punk phase. Then they went way out and were into a Britpop period. And then they had a weird left turn into like jam-band stuff, like Phish and Dave Matthews Band.&quot; Then Levine discovered Stevie Wonder and had a kind of revelation. Like Stevie, he has a high-pitched register, a voice that, he found, was best suited to bouncy, Motown-inflected pop.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.10">When Maroon 5 debuted their new, funky, Stevie-inspired sound, their fans and friends in what Valentine calls &quot;cool bands&quot; were horrified. Not only was the music vaguely embarrassing in the way it always is when a skinny white guy imitates Michael Jackson; it was the kind of music you could imagine being played in a rock block with Britney Spears, not on KROQ. It sounded, suspiciously, like they were trying to be <em>successful.</em></p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.11">Which they were. &quot;I wanted to become a successful musician,&quot; Levine says now. &quot;It wasn&#x2019;t like now, when kids are like, &#x2019;I want to be a famous slut. Or whatever I can possibly be famous for.&#x2019; I wanted to be a famous <em>musician.</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.12">It&#x2019;s hard to remember, but this was in a time when being a slacker was something to aspire to. Saying you wanted to be successful was like announcing that you loved hair metal or shopping at Structure. Sure, lots of people did, but it wasn&#x2019;t cool. &quot;That&#x2019;s the &#x2019;90s in a nutshell,&quot; says Levine. &quot;Oh, you can&#x2019;t, like, <em>try.</em> &#x2019;Oh, no, I could never pursue mass worldwide success! No, that wouldn&#x2019;t be <em>cool.</em>&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.13">Between the irresistible pop hooks, Levine&#x2019;s boy-band good looks, and the borderline-filthy lyrics, Maroon 5&#x2019;s first album went over with the Top 40-consuming public like <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em> at an administrative-assistants convention.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.14">When the album went triple platinum, Levine pretty much reacted the way anyone who has spent twenty-five years dreaming of being a rock star might. He moved into the Chateau Marmont, where rumor had it he personally auditioned every celebutante crotch flashed in the mid-aughts: Lohan, Jessica Simpson, Paris Hilton, and sundry other blondes. &quot;Maybe,&quot; he told an interviewer about why he slept with so many women, &quot;the reason I was promiscuous is that I love them so much.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.15">&quot;Um, all right,&quot; says Levine when presented with this evidence pointing toward douchehood. &quot;All of a sudden, I had money in my bank account. I hadn&#x2019;t had a break in a long time. And I went a little fucking nuts. You know? And good,&quot; he adds defensively. &quot;I deserved to go a little bit nuts. And I had the time of my life.&quot; Fair enough. But dude: <em>I love women?</em></p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.16">&quot;I didn&#x2019;t say it like <em>that,</em>&quot; he protests. &quot;I didn&#x2019;t say it like <em>Fabio.</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.17">He flops back and props a pillow under his head. &quot;Men are not as sophisticated as women,&quot; he goes on. &quot;They&#x2019;re not as mature as women. They&#x2019;re not as connected with their emotions as women. There&#x2019;s a very Neanderthal quality that still exists in a lot of men. There&#x2019;s the carnal shit you can&#x2019;t deny. And if you&#x2019;re in the public eye, to me, it&#x2019;s very boring to say what you have to say and be media trained to the extent that you don&#x2019;t ever reveal any truth. There was a time in my life when I lived probably a bit more on the primal level. And it was amazing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.18">Ever since these youthful indiscretions, Levine has been doing what feels like a long walk of shame. &quot;That was kind of the foundation of all the negative shit I still get,&quot; he posits. &quot;I was out there having fun, you know. I didn&#x2019;t give a shit, and I got burned for it.&quot; He goes to the fridge, opens another bottle of coconut water, and chugs it. &quot;People change; people grow up, get more self-aware and in tune with all this shit.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.19">And his recent birthday, he says, made him more in tune with all this shit. &quot;Being 35, as a dude, is basically the time in your life where you say, &#x2019;Am I gonna be a kid for twenty more years? Or am I gonna be a grown-up?&#x2019; &quot; he says. &quot;It&#x2019;s almost like you think to yourself, God, you know, I don&#x2019;t want to be a 50-year-old dude trolling around a club in L.A.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1a">When it comes to his fianc&#xE9;e, Behati Prinsloo, Levine is clearly besotted. &quot;She&#x2019;s the coolest person in the world,&quot; he says. But it is also true that &quot;B,&quot; as he calls her, is the third Victoria&#x2019;s Secret model he has dated in five years, another data point that lends credence to the image of him as what the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> calls &quot;a sexy creep.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1b">At mention of &quot;the model thing,&quot; as he puts it, Levine&#x2019;s hackles are raised. &quot;I don&#x2019;t date what the person does,&quot; he says. &quot;I date the fucking person. You know what I mean? I could have been a zitty teenager and walked into a Tower Records, and we would have talked about Pearl Jam, and we would have fallen in love when we were 15. And that&#x2019;s when you know. It&#x2019;s like, oh, my God, game over.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1c">And if he had to date &quot;the entire Victoria&#x2019;s Secret catalog,&quot; as his <em>Voice</em> co-star Carson Daly put it, to find her? &quot;So what?&quot; Levine says, unscrewing another coconut water.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1d">&quot;Preference should never be looked down upon,&quot; he opines. &quot;Unless it&#x2019;s based on something really shitty. I&#x2019;m not saying I have a preference, but like, I want to date someone... Listen, there are a lot of women in this country, in many countries, who date men for their money. Okay?

Back at the diner, he&#x2019;d come up with three indicators of douchiness. A lack of self-awareness. &quot;That&#x2019;s big,&quot; he said. Levine is definitely self-aware. Arrogance. &quot;I&#x2019;m not arrogant,&quot; he protested. &quot;I&#x2019;m cocky. It&#x2019;s different. Cocky is playful.&quot; The third was insecurity. &quot;Or masking deep insecurity with too much security,&quot; he said. Arguably, posing naked on the cover of a Russian magazine with his last Victoria&#x2019;s Secret model girlfriend could fit the bill. But it doesn&#x2019;t really. &quot;I&#x2019;m confident,&quot; he said. &quot;Some people don&#x2019;t like confidence. They <em>resent</em> confidence.&quot; This is true, and it may be the main reason Levine is so often slapped with the douchebag label. Modern celebrities are supposed to be hiding cellulite and driving Priuses, not driving flamboyant Ferraris and dating models and exposing extremely enviable, well-toned abs. Even though all those things, like weed and tacos, are objectively awesome. It&#x2019;s not <em>cool.</em></p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1h">&quot;He&#x2019;s very defiant in doing a lot of the things that make him happy,&quot; says Valentine. &quot;Like, &#x2019;I want to live the life I want to and I am not going to feel any guilt about it.&#x2019; And other people don&#x2019;t really want to root for a guy like that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1i">Just as, back in the &#x2019;90s, when Levine violated the rules of budding rock stardom by acknowledging his ambition, he has since broken the Just Like Us vow of celebrity: Never act like you are having too much fun. &quot;Every day,&quot; he&#x2019;d said to me, &quot;every single day, at some point, I think to myself, this is so great. It&#x2019;s <em>so much fun.</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1j">Now Levine returns from the bathroom. &quot;You know what the gist of this article is?&quot; he says. &quot;Your opening line can be: &#x2019;You don&#x2019;t have to like me, but I&#x2019;d prefer it if you did.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s kind of how I feel. I&#x2019;m not the easiest person to love right off the bat, you know. If I knew everyone in the world, they would love me. Every single last fucking one of them.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1k"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1l">A morning session of yoga at the Mercer hotel has loosened up his P90X&#x2019;ed body and left Levine limber enough to be able to give a small wave to the Maroon 5 fans clustered outside the red carpet at the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of <em>Begin Again.</em> &quot;Ow,&quot; he moans a little, under their deafening screeches.</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1m">In the film, Levine plays Dave, a struggling singer-songwriter who becomes an overnight success. At first, says the director, John Carney, &quot;it felt a bit stunty&quot; to cast Levine in the role. But he says Levine was actually pretty good at making the character, who cheats on his indie-singer girlfriend, played by Keira Knightley, and ultimately chooses the wide world of rock stardom over their small life together, seem sympathetic. &quot;He wasn&#x2019;t totally black-and-white, you know, and a lot of that is due to Adam,&quot; says Carney. &quot;You see him being tempted by these things he comes across, and you understand why it&#x2019;s appealing. Even as you sort of want to strangle him.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1n">Levine skips the screening&#x2014;he&#x2019;s already seen the movie (&quot;I was surprised at how not-sucky I was,&quot; he says)&#x2014;and instead has a meeting with his managers about doing more film work. Then, at the afterparty at Tribeca Grill, he and Behati Prinsloo are wrapped around each other in a banquette, giggling, when Levine&#x2019;s publicist interrupts. Bill de Blasio, the newly elected mayor of New York City, wants to meet him. Levine untangles himself and turns on his twinkliest smile. &quot;You were great,&quot; the mayor tells him. &quot;You really inhabited the role.&quot; Then the mayor puts on a stern look and mock scolds him over the douche sins of his character. &quot;I&#x2019;m still kind of pissed off at you, to be honest,&quot; he says, laughing. &quot;What a jerk you are!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1o">Levine keeps twinkling, but now his eyes have narrowed ever so slightly. After all, his character just wanted to be successful. What&#x2019;s so bad about that?</p><p data-reactid=".9fra6ny5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1p"><strong>JESSICA PRESSLER</strong> <em>profiled <a
