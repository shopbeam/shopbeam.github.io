  	    "articleBody": "How to Rock a Tweed Suit with Matthew McConaughey\u000A\u000ABrothers and sisters, behold the fruits of the McConaissance. The man himself is sitting in the back of a black chauffeured Mercedes-Benz, gliding effortlessly down the 405, relad, legs akimbo, wearing boots, gray jeans, a white V-neck, and sunglasses. On one knee is balanced a bottle of kombucha, the flavor of which, when combined with the packet of chewing tobacco tucked into his lower lip, can only be guessed at. On the other, there\u0027s a brown leather journal with a turquoise clasp—a place to record stray thoughts, doodles, visual diagrams of future roles, and whatever else pops into his head.\u000A\u000A\u0022A man should always have his diary on him,\u0022 Matthew McConaughey says, grinning, borrowing from Oscar Wilde. \u0022That way he\u0027s guaranteed to always have something incredible to read.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe car is bearing McConaughey from Los Angeles to San Diego, where he will make a surprise appearance at Comic-Con on behalf of Interstellar, the dimension-bending Christopher Nolan epic he stars in this month. Afterward he and his family will board a private plane for Massachusetts, where he will shoot Gus Van Sant\u0027s latest, The Sea of Trees. Both are the kind of role McConaughey wouldn\u0027t have sniffed only a few years ago. The story of this transformation is repeated so often it\u0027s taken on the quality of an American parable: Preternaturally talented young man gets lost in a maze of easy, interchangeable romantic comedies before suddenly seeing the light and getting serious. An Oscar, Emmy nominations, a whole new status follow. Lo, he is risen.\u000A\u000AThe first sign that perhaps the story isn\u0027t quite so simple may have come in McConaughey\u0027s Oscar speech for Dallas Buyers Club, in every way the kind of Very Serious Movie designed to breed smug and sentimental showboating. Instead, it was old-school McConaughey—part flirt, part hippie preacher, all brash and cheerful self-regard. So much for killing the past. We even got an \u0022All right, all right, all right.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn person, it\u0027s easy to feel that McConaughey contains if not multitudes, then at least enough facets to defy easy categorization. He\u0027s a joyful talker with a gift for conversation that is much like his gift for acting: a talent for being extraordinarily present and engaged, no matter how banal or repetitive the circumstances. Credit that for the fact that, at any given moment, at least one of those supposedly disposable romantic comedies is airing somewhere in the cable universe. And for the fact that he\u0027s more than game to kick the tires of the Parable of McConaughey to see what\u0027s true, what\u0027s false, and what lies in between.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHow do you like the word McConaissance?\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a cool word. It sounds good. It\u0027s got a good meter.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s almost like you had to have one, just so we could call it that.\u000A\u000AWhen you say it, it\u0027s like, \u0022I don\u0027t know what that is, but it sounds good.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve been famous since your early twenties. Did you feel like it was a problem, having your image set at such a young age?\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve never had fears that I was stuck in one thing. I\u0027m sure we\u0027re going to talk about the years when I was in romantic comedies and I was seen as the guy who was on the beach, running around shirtless. I did that. Damn right that was me. I wasn\u0027t scared like, \u0022Oh God, I\u0027m going to be stuck here.\u0022 But I was like, I understand at some point that that is in italics now. So I said, \u0022You know what? I\u0027m not going to be openly presenting that for a while. I\u0027m going to un-brand.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut there was truth in the italics?\u000A\u000AWell, it has two parts. One was the myth that was branded and created. Second, yeah, it\u0027s me. I did Fool\u0027s Gold in Australia, had a summer in Malibu, and made a surfer film—basically, when you edit those all together, it was one continuous ninety-degree day on the beach without a shirt. But also, I worked hard to live in Malibu, California. I\u0027m going to the beach! I\u0027m gonna go surfing! No, I don\u0027t want to wear a shirt. I want to get a tan and feel the sun on my bones. And it\u0027s Tuesday. You\u0027re recording it? Good for you.\u000A\u000ADo you have a name for that character? The \u0022All right, all right\u0022 guy? Do you ever refer to him in the third person?\u000A\u000ANo.\u000A\u000ADoes your wife? Like, \u0022Hey, let\u0027s have a little less of so-and-so...\u0022?\u000A\u000ANo, no. It\u0027s not... There\u0027s no demarcation.\u000A\u000AAnd you\u0027ve never felt the need to pretend you weren\u0027t having a good time?\u000A\u000AFuck no. Fuck that. I\u0027m not going to apologize for enjoying what I do.\u000A\u000ASince you bring it up, is there work in the romantic comedies that you\u0027re proud of?\u000A\u000AAbsolutely. These things aren\u0027t easy. What\u0027s hard is to make them look easy. Those kinds of movies are what they are. They get pooh-poohed by critics. They get pooh-poohed by actors themselves. And in a way I get it, but in other ways it\u0027s completely unfair. There\u0027s a buoyancy you need to make them work. I believe I gave them buoyancy. And some of the shoots were very difficult, with me trying to fight for the balls on the guy.\u000A\u000AWhat do you mean?\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s a romantic comedy? Boy meets girl. They get together. Something happens. Girl takes off. Boy chases girl. They get back together. The end. A lot of times the male is somewhat emasculated, meaning he has to crawl back and say, \u0022I\u0027m nothing without you. If you don\u0027t take me back, I\u0027m nothing.\u0022 And I was always like, \u0022What girl wants that guy?\u0022 I\u0027ve got no problem saying, \u0022I\u0027m sorry. You want to give this another shot?\u0022 But I\u0027ve got to come back with some integrity—even if it\u0027s on a moped with a veil on my head. Look, I\u0027m happy if you think I \u0022cruised through\u0022 those. I did my work.\u000A\u000AI guess it would be an asshole question to ask you to name them all.\u000A\u000AWedding Planner, Failure to Launch, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Fool\u0027s Gold, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past... There\u0027s five.\u000A\u000AAnd the women that were in them.\u000A\u000ASo, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kate Hudson, Kate, Jennifer.\u000A\u000ASo the other part of the myth, that this new phase is in direct opposition to that part of your career, is that fake, too?\u000A\u000AIt may make a more interesting narrative and a dramatic punch, but it\u0027s not true. Did there come a time when I picked up a script and was like, \u0022God, I feel like I could do this [part] tomorrow\u0022? Yes. That\u0027s when I made a calculation to say, \u0022I don\u0027t want to do those right now.\u0022 I thought, \u0022I love harder, I cry harder, I laugh harder in my real life than I do in my work. I\u0027ve got things in my life every single day, risks that I\u0027m taking that are scaring me. Why is my work not scaring me?\u0022\u000A\u000AIt does seem as though you were far more creative in creating this bohemian, idiosyncratic life offscreen than you were on-screen.\u000A\u000AAnd I was like, \u0022Thank God!\u0022 I congratulated myself on being that way instead of the other way around. But I also said, \u0022I want to get more from my career than I\u0027m getting right now.\u0022 I talked to my agent. I talked to my wife. I talked to my moneyman and said, \u0022Hey, I may not work for a while. We good?\u0022 So I went away for two years.\u000A\u000AHow did that feel?\u000A\u000AI had anxious moments. I had nights waking up. Mind you, I had a secret weapon. I had my first kid about to come home.\u000A\u000AWhat do you mean by \u0022secret weapon\u0022?\u000A\u000ANever is a man more of a man than when he is the father of a newborn. Whatever decisions you make in the first six months of becoming a father, double down on them. I mean, you\u0027re meeting the Courier. You\u0027re meeting the Shepherd, the Future Prince. You immediately have something you don\u0027t have to think about. You know what\u0027s important. Bam! And the clarity of that is like, \u0022Whew.\u0022 I definitely got more selfish. And at the same time, I think I got more compassionate, which don\u0027t always go together, you know?\u000A\u000AWere you scared of becoming a father?\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s the one thing I\u0027ve always wanted to be. I knew when I was 8 years old. I mean, I wanted to be things like the Washington Redskins running back and all that stuff, but the one thing I knew I wanted to be was a father. I understood that was why my dad was making me say \u0022Yes, sir\u0022 and \u0022Yes, ma\u0027am\u0022 to elders. You know, \u0022I\u0027m not on par with the adults yet. There\u0027s places to go.\u0022\u000A\u000ADo your kids say sir and ma\u0027am?\u000A\u000AYeah. We just like it. We like the Mr. and Mrs. and the please and thank you\u0027s. We take a version of that southern thing.\u000A\u000AMore important, you were a Redskins fan growing up in Texas? What the hell was that about?\u000A\u000ATwo things. First: 4 years old, watching Westerns, I always rooted for the Indians. Second, my favorite food was hamburgers. The Redskins had a linebacker named Chris Hanburger.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s all it took?\u000A\u000AWhen you\u0027re 4 years old, that\u0027s all it takes. I got a Redskins hat in my bag right now.\u000A\u000AWhat do you think about the calls for the team to change its name?\u000A\u000AMan, it\u0027s twofold. What interests me is how quickly it got pushed into the social consciousness. We were all fine with it since the 1930s, and all of a sudden we go, \u0022No, gotta change it\u0022? It seems like when the first levee breaks, everybody gets on board. I know a lot of Native Americans don\u0027t have a problem with it, but they\u0027re not going to say, \u0022No, we really want the name.\u0022 That\u0027s not how they\u0027re going to use their pulpit. It\u0027s like my feeling about gun control: \u0022I get it. You have the right to have guns. But look, let\u0027s forget that right. Let\u0027s forget the pleasure you get safely on your range, because it\u0027s in the wrong hands in other places.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut as a fan, it would hurt you a little to see the logo gone?\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not going to hurt me. It\u0027s just... I love the emblem. I dig it. It gives me a little fire and some oomph. But now that it\u0027s in the court of public opinion, it\u0027s going to change. I wish it wouldn\u0027t, but it will.\u000A\u000AOkay, so you go on hiatus. What was the first thing that made you feel like you were on the right track?\u000A\u000AI think it was Killer Joe, which took me a few reads before I found the meter of Tracy Letts\u0027s writing, and all of a sudden I thought it was hilarious. Then Steve Soderbergh called and pitched me about Magic Mike.\u000A\u000ADid you see that role as a chance to play off the myth?\u000A\u000ANot \u0022play off\u0022 the myth: Take the myth to the Smithsonian. Get it bronzed. What I was saying was, \u0022In case you didn\u0027t know, I\u0027ve always been in on the joke.\u0022\u000A\u000AWas it a kind of funeral for that character?\u000A\u000AShit no. It was just me raising the stakes. Saying, \u0022Yeah, and...\u0022 And mind you, these are all lightning-rod characters. Dallas in Magic Mike is a lightning rod. Mark Hanna in The Wolf of Wall Street is a lightning rod. You know: Soothsayers. Preachers. Barnum &amp; Bailey. Poets. So there\u0027s a musicality to them. It\u0027s like this church we go to when we\u0027re in New Orleans, the Sunlight Baptist church. It\u0027s a whole different rhythm and way of speaking. \u0022I\u0027m talking about the Wave Maker! The Prime Mooovah!\u0022 It\u0027s not the white-collar prayers I grew up with.\u000A\u000ADoes your family go to church every Sunday?\u000A\u000AYeah. In Texas. It\u0027s non-denominational. It\u0027s based in the faith that Jesus is the son of God, that he died for our sins, but many different denominations come in.\u000A\u000AWas that a return for you, or had you been going all along?\u000A\u000AAs soon as we had children, I was like, \u0022You know what? That was important to my childhood.\u0022 Even if it was just for the ritual of giving an hour and a half on Sunday to yourself, to pray and to think about others, even if you\u0027re tired or whatever. I noticed how much I missed it and needed it. It\u0027s a time for me to take inventory of my last week, to look at what\u0027s in the future and say my thank-you\u0027s and think about what I can work on to do better.\u000A\u000AWhen you talk about God, do you imagine him as...\u000A\u000AThe Prrime Moovah! The Waave Maker!\u000A\u000ABut it\u0027s an identifiable presence? Someone who can hear what you\u0027re saying?\u000A\u000AYes. And somebody who can help answer my questions. Someone who has a hand in all of this miracle we call life, which I believe is a miracle. But, see, at the same time, I completely believe in evolution.\u000A\u000ADo you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?\u000A\u000A[long pause] Well, it\u0027s a heaven of a story, ain\u0027t it?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThis is McConaughey\u0027s first-ever appearance at Comic-Con, the massive annual confluence of nerd culture and corporate shilling. His arrival is treated with the secrecy accorded a presidential visit to a war zone. The Mercedes pulls into the underground garage of the US Grant hotel, and we are whisked up a back elevator to a floor that has been cleared of all guests for McConaughey and Nolan, also a first-timer. Contained in a room, McConaughey is restless, alternately flopping on the bed and pacing, examining surfaces—the windowsill, the wallpaper—curiously with his fingertips as he speaks. When his wife, Camila, and their three children arrive, he rushes to say hi; the eldest, Levi, introduces himself politely before descending on a stash of superhero swag from the convention floor.\u000A\u000AWhere did you first hear the music you were talking about earlier? How did it get in you?\u000A\u000AMy brother Pat turned me on to music. That\u0027s who Wooderson was based on in Dazed and Confused—not actually who he was, but my romanticized view of him when I was 11 and he was 17: seven feet tall, cooler than James Dean, driving an \u002781 Z28 that was the fastest car in the world, with a sound system that was cooler than Phil Spector\u0027s Wall of Sound.\u000A\u000AWhat was your other brother, the eldest, like?\u000A\u000ARooster—his name is Mike McConaughey, but people know him as Rooster—was out of the house already when I was growing up, but he\u0027s one of the great salesmen. He\u0027s still an original in his business. He\u0027s a genius.\u000A\u000AWhat does he sell?\u000A\u000APipes, for drilling oil. He\u0027s... How do I explain this? In his early twenties, he was already a major salesman, going to Vegas twenty-four times a year, and I think it was the Aladdin casino that offered him an $85,000-a-year salary, plus room and board, plus gambling money, if he would just live there and play—because he just draws people to him.\u000A\u000AAre you telling me that you are not the most charismatic McConaughey?\u000A\u000ANope. And he\u0027s not a joke teller. Never tells a joke, never repeats a story. It\u0027s all off of what\u0027s happening. It\u0027s all present, brand-new. Every time.\u000A\u000AWas your dad like that?\u000A\u000ADad was the biggest ham of them all. He and Rooster were best friends.\u000A\u000AHe died suddenly?\u000A\u000AMy dad died of heart failure making love to my mother.\u000A\u000ADid the family consider that a good way to go?\u000A\u000AYeah. Because that\u0027s how he said he was going to go. He predicted it twenty years before it happened.\u000A\u000AThat must have made each time kind of scary.\u000A\u000AOr kind of exciting.\u000A\u000AGood point. After already having children with Camila, why did you decide to get married?\u000A\u000AI had to get to the point where I saw it as more than just the thing to do. I wanted to really want to. You know, I didn\u0027t want it to be a destination; the fun is that we\u0027re on the adventure together. So I spent a lot of time with her. We talked about it spiritually. We did a lot of reading and talked to a lot of people that had been divorced, a lot of people that had been happily married. We talked to our pastor. In the end, our understanding was, Let\u0027s go make a covenant, with you, me, and God. And let\u0027s understand that this is not a destination, this is the beginning of an adventure that we\u0027re taking together. Once that clicked with me and I didn\u0027t have to intellectualize my way into it, I started to feel the excitement. I was having my own definition of the freedom I wanted thrown right back at me, in possibly a much greater way.\u000A\u000AThat sounds healthy.\u000A\u000AAnd look, some of it had to do with her putting it on me. It took her going, \u0022C\u0027mon, Big Boy, Mr. Easygoing-We\u0027ll-Get-to-It-When-We-Get-to-It. Either shit or get off the pot.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd have you been able to maintain that sense of an ongoing life while maintaining your family?\u000A\u000ABetter than I had imagined I would. If anything, the more secure I feel at home, the more I feel like I\u0027m able to fly.\u000A\u000ASo Killer Joe happened, Magic Mike happened. And then Dallas Buyers Club. At that point, had any of the common wisdom of what you were capable and not capable of as an actor set in the back of your head? Did you think you might not be able to do it?\u000A\u000ANo. Absolutely not. Not even a hint. Not in the middle of the night. Not in the middle of the day. No. No.\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a certain cynicism about actors who lose a lot of weight for a role, like they\u0027re just trying to be considered legit.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve got to understand: For an actor, it\u0027s not an affectation. It wasn\u0027t some clever choice I made. It was a necessity for the role, a very clear decision: \u0022If I don\u0027t look like I\u0027m gonna die, you don\u0027t believe I have HIV.\u0022 Period.\u000A\u000ADo you think it worked?\u000A\u000AI watched it, and I remember thinking to myself, \u0022Wow. You look like a reptile.\u0022 And then, by the end of the scene, I was going, \u0022Who is this Ron Woodroof guy?\u0022 And I felt like I was with Ron. That doesn\u0027t always happen.\u000A\u000AIt was the first time that I can see you allowed yourself to be ugly on-screen. Did it help to let go of some vanity?\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t know. I am vain. I think vanity is a good thing. It\u0027s done more good things for me than it has not. In this case, I would have been embarrassed if I didn\u0027t get to where I needed to get. That was vanity at work. Not \u0022Where did my muscles go?\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve always had trouble squaring your laid-back image with the work it must take to keep your body the way it is.\u000A\u000ANah. I have good genes. My dad was an athlete. I got real fortunate with that. I can curl that frickin\u0027 diary twenty times and look like I\u0027ve been going to the gym. I haven\u0027t used a weight in three years. Plus ten pounds, minus ten pounds—I can go bam, within a week. [Five minutes later, mid-conversation, McConaughey drops to the Oriental rug on the floor of the hotel room we\u0027re in and begins absentmindedly doing push-ups, \u0022just to wake up.\u0022]\u000A\u000AThe leanness carried over really well to True Detective. Did you understand everything Rust Cohle said in that series?\u000A\u000AYep.\u000A\u000AReally?\u000A\u000AI mean, I understood a lot. But then, I spent many, many, many, many, many, many hours, if not days, writing to Nic Pizzolatto and asking, \u0022What are you saying here? What does this mean? Why is he saying it now?\u0022 And then I was able to take it and make it my own. I\u0027ve seen a lot of detective scripts since then, but none of them could wear the jockstrap of Rusty Cohle.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re about to go shoot The Sea of Trees, which is about Japan\u0027s \u0022suicide forest,\u0022 and one of your people said you\u0027d be too depressed to talk during shooting...\u000A\u000ADepressed? Who said that word?\u000A\u000AYou don\u0027t get depressed?\u000A\u000ANo! There are times when I don\u0027t like my own company. But depressed...\u000A\u000ASo how do you characterize those times?\u000A\u000AI get lazy. My brain\u0027s not wild enough, not in tune enough, to be finding things that inspire me.\u000A\u000AWhat do you do about it?\u000A\u000AWell, if I can sleep, I sleep. I find rest does wonders. But usually I go off on my own. I\u0027ll go take a trip alone. Just to get to the point where I know that, like it or not, I\u0027m stuck with myself. That I have to go through this and figure out what the fuck it is that\u0027s bugging me. You know, there\u0027s five things that take work to maintain. [ticking them off on his fingers] Father, husband, health, career, friendship. You\u0027ve got to maintain them, you\u0027ve got to cultivate them, you\u0027ve got to water them.\u000A\u000AAnd how are your five fingers doing?\u000A\u000AI\u0027m happy to say I feel like I\u0027m in the black. The one thing that\u0027s gone into the debit is me being a good friend. Career, marriage, fatherhood—the others are doing good.\u000A\u000AProbably your most famous friendship has been with Lance Armstrong. Do you maintain contact with him?\u000A\u000AYeah. Not as much. We e-mail here and there.\u000A\u000AHow is he doing?\u000A\u000AHe seems to be doing well. I don\u0027t know anyone who can shake hands—meaning look at their situation realistically and deal with it—as quickly as him. He honestly has looked it in the eye and is on the road to recovery.\u000A\u000ASo many actors just hang out with other actors. What was your relationship with Lance based on?\u000A\u000AI like people who are great at what they do. At that time, we were two single men who were doing good in their careers and came from different places. We would get together and have a steak dinner and philosophize—talk about life, talk about what it meant to be a man, what our responsibilities were, what it meant to be a father. You try to gain a little wisdom from each other. That\u0027s mainly what I do with my male friends. We get together and talk about life.\u000A\u000ADid you feel like you needed an apology from him for lying to you?\u000A\u000ATo put my own emotions in front of this and go \u0022You didn\u0027t tell me the truth\u0022 would be arrogant. And you know what? This is a friend. Who I know to be a good man. If there was an apology, it was said and I heard it.\u000A\u000AAre you ever called Matt?\u000A\u000ANever. Never, ever, ever. Some people do it online just to fuck with me. If anybody\u0027s like, \u0022Hey, Matt!\u0022 I don\u0027t even turn around.\u000A\u000AIs there some foundational experience that made you hate it?\u000A\u000AYeah, the foundational experience of being on the playground in kindergarten. My buddy John says, \u0022Hey, Matt, you want to go play on the monkey bars?\u0022 I\u0027m like, \u0022Sure,\u0022 and I\u0027m going out there, and all of a sudden—wham—I\u0027m on the ground. I look up and my mom says, \u0022What\u0027s your name?\u0022 \u0022Matthew.\u0022 \u0022Don\u0027t you ever answer to \u0027Matt\u0027 again.\u0022 From that day on, it\u0027s always been, \u0022Call me Matthew, please.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhoa. I didn\u0027t expect a full-on scene of violence. What was her problem?\u000A\u000AShe named me Matthew for a reason.\u000A\u000ALast night at dinner, someone said, \u0022Things have been going so well for McConaughey, it\u0027s probably time for him to step in shit.\u0022\u000A\u000A That\u0027s funny.... \u0022Step in shit.\u0022 See, I love to see other people\u0027s success. I never wait for anyone to step in shit.\u000A\u000ABut do you feel the pressure of increased expectations?\u000A\u000AThere hasn\u0027t been any pressure. I know what hand I had in all this. It didn\u0027t just fall off and happen. Did I have the whole hand? No. But I know what choices I made. And I sure didn\u0027t make them for the guy who says, \u0022It\u0027s time for him to step in shit.\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027ll tell him.\u000A\u000ALet him know: I step in shit all the time. It\u0027s just that I don\u0027t get that pissed off when I step in it. I just scrape off my boots. I\u0027ve stepped in plenty of shit and will continue to. And by the way: Sometimes stepping in shit is good luck.\u000A\u000ABrett Martin (@brettmartin) is a GQ correspondent.",

Matthew McConaughey</a></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1"><em>Brothers and sisters, behold the fruits of the McConaissance.</em> The man himself is sitting in the back of a black chauffeured Mercedes-Benz, gliding effortlessly down the 405, relad, legs akimbo, wearing boots, gray jeans, a white V-neck, and sunglasses. On one knee is balanced a bottle of kombucha, the flavor of which, when combined with the packet of chewing tobacco tucked into his lower lip, can only be guessed at. On the other, there&#x2019;s a brown leather journal with a turquoise clasp&#x2014;a place to record stray thoughts, doodles, visual diagrams of future roles, and whatever else pops into his head.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2">&quot;A man should always have his diary on him,&quot; Matthew McConaughey says, grinning, borrowing from Oscar Wilde. &quot;That way he&#x2019;s guaranteed to always have something incredible to read.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3">The car is bearing McConaughey from Los Angeles to San Diego, where he will make a surprise appearance at Comic-Con on behalf of <em>Interstellar,</em> the dimension-bending Christopher Nolan epic he stars in this month. Afterward he and his family will board a private plane for Massachusetts, where he will shoot Gus Van Sant&#x2019;s latest, <em>The Sea of Trees.</em> Both are the kind of role McConaughey wouldn&#x2019;t have sniffed only a few years ago. The story of this transformation is repeated so often it&#x2019;s taken on the quality of an American parable: Preternaturally talented young man gets lost in a maze of easy, interchangeable romantic comedies before suddenly seeing the light and getting serious. An Oscar, Emmy nominations, a whole new status follow. <em>Lo, he is risen.</em></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.5">The first sign that perhaps the story isn&#x2019;t quite so simple may have come in McConaughey&#x2019;s Oscar speech for <em>Dallas Buyers Club,</em> in every way the kind of Very Serious Movie designed to breed smug and sentimental showboating. Instead, it was old-school McConaughey&#x2014;part flirt, part hippie preacher, all brash and cheerful self-regard. So much for killing the past. We even got an &quot;All right, all right, all right.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.6">In person, it&#x2019;s easy to feel that McConaughey contains if not multitudes, then at least enough facets to defy easy categorization. He&#x2019;s a joyful talker with a gift for conversation that is much like his gift for acting: a talent for being extraordinarily present and engaged, no matter how banal or repetitive the circumstances. Credit that for the fact that, at any given moment, at least one of those supposedly disposable romantic comedies is airing somewhere in the cable universe. And for the fact that he&#x2019;s more than game to kick the tires of the Parable of McConaughey to see what&#x2019;s true, what&#x2019;s false, and what lies in between.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.7"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>How do you like the word <em>McConaissance?</em></strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.9">It&#x2019;s a cool word.

Did you feel like it was a problem, having your image set at such a young age?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.d">I&#x2019;ve never had fears that I was stuck in one thing. I&#x2019;m sure we&#x2019;re going to talk about the years when I was in romantic comedies and I was seen as the guy who was on the beach, running around shirtless. I did that. Damn right that was me. I wasn&#x2019;t scared like, &quot;Oh God, I&#x2019;m going to be stuck here.&quot; But I was like, I understand at some point that that is in italics now. So I said, &quot;You know what? I&#x2019;m not going to be openly presenting that for a while. I&#x2019;m going to <em>un-brand.</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>But there was truth in the italics?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.f">Well, it has two parts. One was the myth that was branded and created. Second, yeah, it&#x2019;s me. I did <em>Fool&#x2019;s Gold</em> in Australia, had a summer in Malibu, and made a surfer film&#x2014;basically, when you edit those all together, it was one continuous ninety-degree day on the beach without a shirt. But also, I worked <em>hard</em> to live in Malibu, California. I&#x2019;m going to the beach! I&#x2019;m gonna go surfing! No, I don&#x2019;t want to wear a shirt. I want to get a tan and feel the sun on my bones. And it&#x2019;s <em>Tuesday.</em> You&#x2019;re recording it? Good for you.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Do you have a name for that character? The &quot;All right, all right&quot; guy? Do you ever refer to him in the third person?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.h">No.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Does your wife? Like, &quot;Hey, let&#x2019;s have a little less of so-and-so...&quot;?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.j">No, no. It&#x2019;s not... There&#x2019;s no demarcation.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>And you&#x2019;ve never felt the need to pretend you weren&#x2019;t having a good time?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.l">Fuck no. Fuck that. I&#x2019;m not going to apologize for enjoying what I do.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Since you bring it up, is there work in the romantic comedies that you&#x2019;re proud of?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.n">Absolutely. These things aren&#x2019;t easy. What&#x2019;s hard is to make them <em>look</em> easy. Those kinds of movies are what they are. They get pooh-poohed by critics. They get pooh-poohed by actors themselves. And in a way I get it, but in other ways it&#x2019;s completely unfair. There&#x2019;s a buoyancy you need to make them work. I believe I gave them buoyancy. And some of the shoots were very difficult, with me trying to fight for the balls on the guy.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>What do you mean?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.p">What&#x2019;s a romantic comedy? Boy meets girl. They get together. Something happens. Girl takes off. Boy chases girl. They get back together. The end. A lot of times the male is somewhat emasculated, meaning he has to crawl back and say, &quot;I&#x2019;m nothing without you. If you don&#x2019;t take me back, I&#x2019;m nothing.&quot; And I was always like, &quot;What girl wants <em>that</em> guy?&quot; I&#x2019;ve got no problem saying, &quot;I&#x2019;m sorry. You want to give this another shot?&quot; But I&#x2019;ve got to come back with some integrity&#x2014;even if it&#x2019;s on a moped with a veil on my head. Look, I&#x2019;m happy if you think I &quot;cruised through&quot; those. I did my work.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>I guess it would be an asshole question to ask you to name them all.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.r"><em>Wedding Planner, Failure to Launch, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, Fool&#x2019;s Gold, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past...</em> There&#x2019;s five.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>And the women that were in them.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.t">So, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kate Hudson, Kate, Jennifer.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong>So the other part of the myth, that this new phase is in direct opposition to that part of your career, is that fake, too?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.v">It may make a more interesting narrative and a dramatic punch, but it&#x2019;s not true. Did there come a time when I picked up a script and was like, &quot;God, I feel like I could do this [part] tomorrow&quot;? Yes. That&#x2019;s when I made a calculation to say, &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to do those right now.&quot; I thought, &quot;I love harder, I cry harder, I laugh harder in my real life than I do in my work. I&#x2019;ve got things in my life every single day, risks that I&#x2019;m taking that are scaring me. Why is my work not scaring me?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong>It does seem as though you were far more creative in creating this bohemian, idiosyncratic life offscreen than you were on-screen.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.x">And I was like, &quot;Thank God!&quot; I congratulated myself on being that way instead of the other way around. But I also said, &quot;I want to get more from my career than I&#x2019;m getting right now.&quot; I talked to my agent. I talked to my wife. I talked to my moneyman and said, &quot;Hey, I may not work for a while. We good?&quot; So I went away for two years.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.y"><strong>How did that feel?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.z">I had anxious moments. I had nights waking up. Mind you, I had a secret weapon. I had my first kid about to come home.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong>What do you mean by &quot;secret weapon&quot;?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.11">Never is a man more of a man than when he is the father of a newborn. Whatever decisions you make in the first six months of becoming a father, double down on them. I mean, you&#x2019;re meeting the Courier. You&#x2019;re meeting the Shepherd, the Future Prince. You immediately have something you don&#x2019;t have to think about. You <em>know</em> what&#x2019;s important. <em>Bam!</em> And the clarity of that is like, &quot;Whew.&quot; I definitely got more selfish. And at the same time, I think I got more compassionate, which don&#x2019;t always go together, you know?</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.12"><strong>Were you scared of becoming a father?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.13">It&#x2019;s the one thing I&#x2019;ve always wanted to be. I knew when I was 8 years old. I mean, I wanted to be things like the Washington Redskins running back and all that stuff, but the one thing I knew I wanted to be was a father. I understood that was why my dad was making me say &quot;Yes, sir&quot; and &quot;Yes, ma&#x2019;am&quot; to elders. You know, &quot;I&#x2019;m not on par with the adults yet. There&#x2019;s places to go.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.14"><strong>Do your kids say <em>sir</em> and <em>ma&#x2019;am?</em></strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.15">Yeah. We just like it. We like the <em>Mr.</em> and <em>Mrs.</em> and the <em>please</em> and <em>thank you&#x2019;</em>s. We take a version of that southern thing.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.16"><strong>More important, you were a Redskins fan growing up in Texas? What the hell was that about?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.17">Two things. First: 4 years old, watching Westerns, I always rooted for the Indians. Second, my favorite food was hamburgers. The Redskins had a linebacker named Chris Hanburger.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.18"><strong>That&#x2019;s all it took?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.19">When you&#x2019;re 4 years old, that&#x2019;s all it takes. I got a Redskins hat in my bag right now.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1a"><strong>What do you think about the calls for the team to change its name?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1b">Man, it&#x2019;s twofold. What interests me is how quickly it got pushed into the social consciousness. We were all fine with it since the 1930s, and all of a sudden we go, &quot;No, gotta change it&quot;? It seems like when the first levee breaks, everybody gets on board. I know a lot of Native Americans don&#x2019;t have a problem with it, but they&#x2019;re not going to say, &quot;No, we <em>really</em> want the name.&quot; That&#x2019;s not how they&#x2019;re going to use their pulpit. It&#x2019;s like my feeling about gun control: &quot;I get it. You have the right to have guns. But look, let&#x2019;s <em>forget</em> that right. Let&#x2019;s forget the pleasure you get safely on your range, because it&#x2019;s in the wrong hands in other places.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><strong>But as a fan, it would hurt you a little to see the logo gone?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1d">It&#x2019;s not going to <em>hurt</em> me. It&#x2019;s just... I love the emblem. I dig it. It gives me a little fire and some oomph. But now that it&#x2019;s in the court of public opinion, it&#x2019;s going to change. I wish it wouldn&#x2019;t, but it will.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><strong>Okay, so you go on hiatus. What was the first thing that made you feel like you were on the right track?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1f">I think it was <em>Killer Joe,</em> which took me a few reads before I found the meter of Tracy Letts&#x2019;s writing, and all of a sudden I thought it was hilarious. Then Steve Soderbergh called and pitched me about <em>Magic Mike</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><strong>Did you see that role as a chance to play off the myth?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1h">Not &quot;play off&quot; the myth: Take the myth <em>to the Smithsonian.</em> Get it <em>bronzed.</em> What I was saying was, &quot;In case you didn&#x2019;t know, I&#x2019;ve always been in on the joke.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1i"><strong>Was it a kind of funeral for that character?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1j">Shit no. It was just me raising the stakes. Saying, &quot;Yeah, <em>and...</em>&quot; And mind you, these are all lightning-rod characters. Dallas in <em>Magic Mike</em> is a lightning rod. Mark Hanna in <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em> is a lightning rod. You know: Soothsayers. Preachers. Barnum &amp; Bailey. Poets. So there&#x2019;s a musicality to them. It&#x2019;s like this church we go to when we&#x2019;re in New Orleans, the Sunlight Baptist church. It&#x2019;s a whole different rhythm and way of speaking. <em>&quot;I&#x2019;m talking about the Wave Maker! The Prime Mooovah!&quot;</em> It&#x2019;s not the white-collar prayers I grew up with.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1k"><strong>Does your family go to church every Sunday?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1l">Yeah. In Texas. It&#x2019;s non-denominational. It&#x2019;s based in the faith that Jesus is the son of God, that he died for our sins, but many different denominations come in.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1m"><strong>Was that a return for you, or had you been going all along?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1n">As soon as we had children, I was like, &quot;You know what? That was important to my childhood.&quot; Even if it was just for the ritual of giving an hour and a half on Sunday to yourself, to pray and to think about others, even if you&#x2019;re tired or whatever. I noticed how much I missed it and needed it. It&#x2019;s a time for me to take inventory of my last week, to look at what&#x2019;s in the future and say my thank-you&#x2019;s and think about what I can work on to do better.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1o"><strong>When you talk about God, do you imagine him as...</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.1p"><em>The Prrime Moovah!

Someone who has a hand in all of this miracle we call life, which I believe <em>is</em> a miracle.

How do I explain this? In his early twenties, he was already a major salesman, going to Vegas twenty-four times a year, and I think it was the Aladdin casino that offered him an $85,000-a-year salary, plus room and board, plus gambling money, if he would just live there and play&#x2014;because he just draws people to him.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.22"><strong>Are you telling me that you are not the most charismatic McConaughey?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.23">Nope.

I wanted to really <em>want</em> to. You know, I didn&#x2019;t want it to be a destination; the fun is that we&#x2019;re on the adventure together. So I spent a lot of time with her. We talked about it spiritually. We did a lot of reading and talked to a lot of people that had been divorced, a lot of people that had been happily married. We talked to our pastor. In the end, our understanding was, Let&#x2019;s go make a covenant, with you, me, and God. And let&#x2019;s understand that this is not a destination, this is the beginning of an adventure that we&#x2019;re taking together. Once that clicked with me and I didn&#x2019;t have to intellectualize my way into it, I started to feel the excitement. I was having my own definition of the freedom I wanted thrown right back at me, in possibly a much greater way.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2e"><strong>That sounds healthy.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2f">And look, some of it had to do with her putting it on me. It took her going, &quot;C&#x2019;mon, Big Boy, Mr. Easygoing-We&#x2019;ll-Get-to-It-When-We-Get-to-It.

And then <em>Dallas Buyers Club.</em> At that point, had any of the common wisdom of what you were capable and not capable of as an actor set in the back of your head? Did you think you might not be able to do it?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2j">No. Absolutely not. Not even a hint. Not in the middle of the night. Not in the middle of the day. No. No.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2k"><strong>There&#x2019;s a certain cynicism about actors who lose a lot of weight for a role, like they&#x2019;re just trying to be considered legit.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2l">You&#x2019;ve got to understand: For an actor, it&#x2019;s not an affectation. It wasn&#x2019;t some clever choice I made. It was a necessity for the role, a very clear decision: &quot;If I don&#x2019;t look like I&#x2019;m gonna die, you don&#x2019;t believe I have HIV.&quot; Period.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2m"><strong>Do you think it worked?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2n">I watched it, and I remember thinking to myself, &quot;Wow. You look like a reptile.&quot; And then, by the end of the scene, I was going, &quot;Who is this Ron Woodroof guy?&quot; And I felt like I was with Ron. That doesn&#x2019;t always happen.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2o"><strong>It was the first time that I can see you allowed yourself to be ugly on-screen. Did it help to let go of some vanity?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2p">I don&#x2019;t know. I am vain. I think vanity is a good thing. It&#x2019;s done more good things for me than it has not. In this case, I would have been embarrassed if I didn&#x2019;t get to where I needed to get. <em>That</em> was vanity at work. Not &quot;Where did my muscles go?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2q"><strong>I&#x2019;ve always had trouble squaring your laid-back image with the work it must take to keep your body the way it is.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2r">Nah. I have good genes. My dad was an athlete. I got real fortunate with that. I can curl that frickin&#x2019; diary twenty times and look like I&#x2019;ve been going to the gym. I haven&#x2019;t used a weight in three years. Plus ten pounds, minus ten pounds&#x2014;I can go <em>bam,</em> within a week. <em>[Five minutes later, mid-conversation, McConaughey drops to the Oriental rug on the floor of the hotel room we&#x2019;re in and begins absentmindedly doing push-ups, &quot;just to wake up.&quot;]</em></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2s"><strong>The leanness carried over really well to <em>True Detective.</em> Did you understand everything Rust Cohle said in that series?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2t">Yep.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2u"><strong>Really?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2v">I mean, I understood a lot. But then, I spent many, many, many, many, many, <em>many</em> hours, if not days, writing to Nic Pizzolatto and asking, &quot;What are you saying here? What does this mean? Why is he saying it now?&quot; And then I was able to take it and make it my own. I&#x2019;ve seen a <em>lot</em> of detective scripts since then, but none of them could wear the jockstrap of Rusty Cohle.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2w"><strong>You&#x2019;re about to go shoot <em>The Sea of Trees,</em> which is about Japan&#x2019;s &quot;suicide forest,&quot; and one of your people said you&#x2019;d be too depressed to talk during shooting...</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2x"><em>Depressed?</em> Who said that word?</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2y"><strong>You don&#x2019;t get depressed?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.2z">No! There are times when I don&#x2019;t like my own company. But depressed...</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.30"><strong>So how do you characterize those times?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.31">I get lazy. My brain&#x2019;s not wild enough, not in tune enough, to be finding things that inspire me.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.32"><strong>What do you do about it?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.33">Well, if I can sleep, I sleep. I find rest does wonders. But usually I go off on my own. I&#x2019;ll go take a trip alone. Just to get to the point where I know that, like it or not, I&#x2019;m stuck with myself. That I have to go through this and figure out what the fuck it is that&#x2019;s bugging me. You know, there&#x2019;s five things that take work to maintain. <em>[ticking them off on his fingers]</em> Father, husband, health, career, friendship. You&#x2019;ve got to maintain them, you&#x2019;ve got to cultivate them, you&#x2019;ve got to water them.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.34"><strong>And how are your five fingers doing?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.35">I&#x2019;m happy to say I feel like I&#x2019;m in the black. The one thing that&#x2019;s gone into the debit is me being a good friend. Career, marriage, fatherhood&#x2014;the others are doing good.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.36"><strong>Probably your most famous friendship has been with Lance Armstrong. Do you maintain contact with him?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.37">Yeah. Not as much. We e-mail here and there.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.38"><strong>How is he doing?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.39">He seems to be doing well. I don&#x2019;t know anyone who can shake hands&#x2014;meaning look at their situation realistically and deal with it&#x2014;as quickly as him. He honestly has looked it in the eye and is on the road to recovery.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3a"><strong>So many actors just hang out with other actors. What was your relationship with Lance based on?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3b">I like people who are great at what they do. At that time, we were two single men who were doing good in their careers and came from different places. We would get together and have a steak dinner and philosophize&#x2014;talk about life, talk about what it meant to be a man, what our responsibilities were, what it meant to be a father. You try to gain a little wisdom from each other. That&#x2019;s mainly what I do with my male friends. We get together and talk about life.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3c"><strong>Did you feel like you needed an apology from him for lying to you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3d">To put my own emotions in front of this and go &quot;You didn&#x2019;t tell me the truth&quot; would be arrogant. And you know what? This is a friend. Who I know to be a good man. If there was an apology, it was said and I heard it.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3e"><strong>Are you ever called Matt?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3f">Never. Never, ever, ever. Some people do it online just to fuck with me.

My buddy John says, &quot;Hey, Matt, you want to go play on the monkey bars?&quot; I&#x2019;m like, &quot;Sure,&quot; and I&#x2019;m going out there, and all of a sudden&#x2014;<em>wham</em>&#x2014;I&#x2019;m on the ground. I look up and my mom says, &quot;What&#x2019;s your name?&quot; &quot;Matthew.&quot; &quot;Don&#x2019;t you <em>ever</em> answer to &#x2019;Matt&#x2019; again.&quot; From that day on, it&#x2019;s always been, &quot;Call me Matthew, please.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3i"><strong>Whoa. I didn&#x2019;t expect a full-on scene of violence. What was her problem?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3j">She named me Matthew for a reason.</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3k"><strong>Last night at dinner, someone said, &quot;Things have been going so well for McConaughey, it&#x2019;s probably time for him to step in shit.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3l"> That&#x2019;s funny.... &quot;Step in shit.&quot; See, I love to see other people&#x2019;s success.

I <em>know</em> what hand I had in all this. It didn&#x2019;t just fall off and happen. Did I have the <em>whole</em> hand? No. But I know what choices I made. And I sure didn&#x2019;t make them for the guy who says, &quot;It&#x2019;s time for him to step in shit.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3o"><strong>I&#x2019;ll tell him.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26frcksnzls.1.1.0.0.4.3p">Let him know: I step in shit all the time. It&#x2019;s just that I don&#x2019;t get that pissed off when I step in it. I just scrape off my boots. I&#x2019;ve stepped in plenty of shit and will continue to.
