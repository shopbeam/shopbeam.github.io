  	    "articleBody": "Kid Rock knows something that you and I don\u0027t. He\u0027s figured out the secret—the dirty, nasty, well-kept secret of American life, which is that rednecks, in general, have more fun than uppity liberal folk like me. If you\u0027re a redneck, you\u0027re not dropping $2,300 a month to live in a Park Slope utility closet. The radio plays songs you actually like. You\u0027re not waiting in line for hours to eat at a trendy restaurant that doesn\u0027t take reservations, because Applebee\u0027s is A-OK with you. Also A-OK: cheap, mass-produced beer. Plus, you get to shoot guns all the time. It\u0027s a remarkably enjoyable lifestyle, and the annual Kid Rock theme cruise, officially called Kid Rock\u0027s Chillin\u0027 the Most Cruise, now in its fourth year, is meant to be a raucous celebration of it, with Rock—a man who countrified the concept of \u0022keeping it real\u0022—as its Pied Piper.\u000A\u000AThere are 2,435 of us sailing out with Rock from Miami on the Norwegian Pearl, and only 1,001 are here for the first time, including me, which explains the virgin tag that will be hanging around my neck for the next five days. The remaining 1,434 passengers are returning for their second, third, even fourth time. They get tags that say VETERAN. It\u0027s an astonishing retention rate, and it explains why more and more musicians are ignoring stereotypes about cruises being a floating graveyard for washed-up acts. Not all of them succeed—Sugar Ray\u0027s \u002790s-nostalgia cruise was canceled in February. But when you find the right match of artist and audience, miracles (and nudity) can happen.\u000A\u000AFrom Miami, our cruise will sail to Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas, a tiny island owned by Norwegian Cruise Line that can be dressed up as a different island every week, depending upon which theme cruise is coming to port. Last fall, it served as headquarters for the KISS Navy. This week the cay will be rechristened Redneck Paradise (after the Kid Rock song). Then we head back out to sea for one more night before arriving back in Miami, where we will hopefully arrive free of Legionnaires\u0027 disease. Two years ago, Kid Rock\u0027s cruise was held aboard the Carnival Triumph, a vessel that became infamous this past February when its engine died at sea and it had to be towed to Alabama, with passengers shitting into paper bags and subsisting on onion sandwiches. (This year\u0027s Kid Rock cruise is on a different boat.  \u0022I can\u0027t believe my name didn\u0027t come up in that,\u0022 he will tell me later. \u0022I was waiting for it to be like, \u0027Kid Rock pooped on that boat!\u0027 \u0022) With any luck, the Pearl will spare us such indignities, because we have other indignities planned.\u000A\u000AThe ship is huge. HUGE. It\u0027s the kind of ship you gawk at from the highway. It\u0027s nearly 1,000 feet long and fifteen stories high. For our voyage, it has been stocked with 26,000 eggs, 357 gallons of ice cream, 8,000 pounds of beef, 1,484 pounds of cheese, and 643 pounds of coffee. There\u0027s also 12,568 pounds of fruit, none of which will be eaten.\u000A\u000AI walk to my room along one of the ship\u0027s many vast hallways. There\u0027s a door-decorating contest going on all week, and the passengers are putting everything they have into it. One cabin door is festooned with a dozen old Playboy centerfolds. Another has a sign blaring JAM OUT WITH YOUR CLAM OUT. In the hallway, I pass by one woman alerting a crew member named Carlos for help dragging her shitfaced friend back to their cabin. \u0022Carlos, we got a drunk one here!\u0022\u000A\u000AWe are still in the port.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A As this ship\u0027s honorary captain, Kid Rock has a number of contractual duties. He must play two shows—one as we leave Miami and a second show two days later over at Redneck Paradise—and participate in at least one nonmusical activity: beers and bingo, the belly-flop contest, etc. This will not be a problem for Kid Rock, as I quickly find out that few musicians enjoy communing with their fans, while just as shitfaced as they are, more than the man christened Bob Ritchie.\u000A\u000ABy the time I get up to the pool deck to watch Rock\u0027s opening show, the party has started without me. There are enormous sunburned men with motion-sickness patches behind their ears shouting out, \u0022I\u0027m on a boat, motherfucker!\u0022 Two women are carrying around an inflatable man with a giant dong sticking out. There are games of flip cup and cornhole in progress. There are joints being fired up all over the place. There are buckets upon buckets of cold ones dotting the deck. There are drunk wives being dragged out of the crowd by their loving husbands. And there are people frolicking in the three hot tubs near the stage. A few of the bathers got into the tubs fully clothed, then began removing their wardrobe piece by wet piece.\u000A\u000AMost of the people here are over 40, and jacked as they are to see their redneck hero take the stage, they seem even more excited to see one another. The close quarters and jam-packed days on a cruise make for intense friendships, ones that linger long after the cruise is over. \u0022We have friends for twenty years that we never see anymore,\u0022 one lady tells me. \u0022We just hang out with the cruise people now.\u0022 It\u0027s a very familiar vibe, and that extends to Rock himself. No one on the ship calls him \u0022Kid Rock.\u0022 He\u0027s Bob or Bobby to everyone.\u000A\u000AAs we wait for Rock to take the stage on deck 12, a couple I meet share a valuable piece of cruise-drinking advice. \u0022Always ask for the wheelchair,\u0022 says the wife. \u0022Because then they\u0027ll roll you back to the cabin if you\u0027re too shitfaced to stand.\u0022 There are nine people aboard who are actually disabled, and I spend the rest of the cruise trying to figure out who\u0027s got ALS and who is merely drunk  beyond functionality.\u000A\u000AAt 5 p.m., Rock comes on wearing a bright pink shirt and plays his version of \u0022Sea Cruise,\u0022 then runs through a bunch of his hits. This is by no means a token appearance: Rock plays for two solid hours. He plays for so long that hardly anyone, including me, notices that we\u0027ve actually left port and are heading out to sea.\u000A\u000AAfter the concert ends, the crowd scatters and I find myself standing in a war zone of crushed lime wedges, bottle caps, and shattered plastic. Beside one of the hot tubs, there\u0027s a Heineken Light bucket filled with warm vomit. The sun falls behind the quickly diminishing skyline of Miami, and I walk up to a group of enormous men outfitted in denim overalls that have been meticulously airbrushed with Kid Rock in various poses. One of them, a giant ripped bald guy named Monte, works as a financial adviser back home in Du Quoin, Illinois.\u000A\u000A\u0022Did you go in the hot tub?\u0022 he asks me.\u000A\u000A\u0022No, but I definitely saw some naked people in there,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A\u0022I would not go in that hot tub if I were you.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe men tell me their overalls were designed by a friend back in Du Quoin. On the 2011 cruise, Kid Rock saw their threads and brought the boys up to the VIP area. Now they are back to hand-deliver a custom pair to Bobby.\u000A\u000A\u0022The pair this year has the Rebel Soul theme with the helicopter, and it says LET\u0027S RIDE across it,\u0022 Monte tells me. \u0022And on the back, it has the Wounded Warrior logo. And then below that, it says NEVER FORGET across the ass, and then below that on the left is the Arlington National Cemetery. It\u0027s like tombstones are going off in the distance. Badass.\u0022\u000A\u000AMonte hands me a beer, and I tell him I\u0027ll buy him one in return. He smiles and politely refuses the offer.\u000A\u000A\u0022No way, man. You\u0027re family now.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A There is a jail on the Pearl—a plain white room located in the bowels of the ship, with a dirty foam mattress and a dim fluorescent light. It\u0027s like being locked inside a vault: confinement within confinement. Last week\u0027s cruise, which was hosted by 311, had a number of scofflaws, including a \u0022Spider-Woman\u0022 who got so high she tried to scale down the front of the ship. The ship\u0027s nurse will tell me that she ended up dangling from one of the wiper blades outside the captain\u0027s bridge. There was also a woman from New Jersey who died on that cruise. Possible heart attack. They stored her in the ship\u0027s morgue—a small closet with room for two cadavers. Later, the nurse will show me the dead woman\u0027s toe tag.\u000A\u000AOn the first morning, there\u0027s a rumor that Kid Rock is plowed and doing shots in one of the hot tubs. But by the time word has spread from stem to stern, he\u0027s gone. He\u0027s like a redneck phantom. I overhear one woman as she laments missing her chance to get wet with Bobby. \u0022I should really be a better stalker,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000AI head for the breakfast buffet. Before entering, for this or any other meal, you are encouraged to get a squirt of Purell from a lady guarding the doors. Every time you get a squirt, she says, \u0022Washy washy! Happy happy!\u0022 This will become a running joke among the passengers. By the end of the trip, everyone is saying hi  to one another by shouting, \u0022WASHY WASHY, MOTHERFUCKER!\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s relatively subdued in here, at least compared with last night, when a woman with huge fake tits and two glittery pasties that looked like tiny starbursts was posing for photographs right next to the soft-serve ice cream bar. She could even flex her boobs individually without touching them. A few feet away, a 13-year-old boy (one of only three minors I see the entire week) saw Sparkle Tits while getting a glass of milk. This, surely, would\u0027ve been the greatest moment of his young life, were it not for the fact that his mother was standing right there, trying to distract him from Sparkle Tits while simultaneously refusing to acknowledge her existence.\u000A\u000AThis morning, so far: no tits with my oatmeal. From my window, I can see Great Stirrup Cay. The beaches on the tiny, Cast Away-sized island were damaged this past fall during Hurricane Sandy, but Norwegian restored them. Now the island is ready to become Redneck Paradise.\u000A\u000AOnce we arrive on the sand, the first activity of the day is the Lucky Bitch contest, in which various ladies get up on a picnic table and, like, do stuff to get the crowd excited. Tits, of course, play a vital role. One contestant asks, \u0022If I get naked, can I meet Kid Rock?\u0022 The winner ends up being a buxom brunette named Tina who managed to keep her top off the longest. Her prize is a merch certificate (redeemable in the onboard gift shop), a plastic tiara, and a sash that says MISS LUCKY BITCH 2013. I ask Tina if she was happy to beat out some of the skinnier, blonder women up on the stage. \u0022Oh yeah,\u0022 she says. \u0022And you know why I won?\u0022  She clutches her boobs. \u0022Because these are real. And bruised!\u0022\u000A\u000AThe Speedo Contest, a just form of revenge for the Lucky Bitch contest, is next. I was offered a spot in the competition and didn\u0027t hesitate for a second before accepting. GQ didn\u0027t send me here to sit on my ass. Kid Rock and his fans want your participation. They crave it. They reward it. This is not a passive experience. You are meant to get very drunk and very naked and encourage others to do likewise. These people are busting their asses trying to have the time of their lives. It would be an insult not to make the same effort myself.\u000A\u000AThe cruise organizers lend me a pair of Kid Rock women\u0027s underwear (close enough to a Speedo)—a set of drum-tight black panties with Kid Rock\u0027s face silk-screened just to the left of my balls and his anthem-slash-motto CUCCI GALORE spread across my ass cheeks—and now I\u0027ve got them on underneath my normal blue swim trunks. My strategy is a classic reveal: dance around for a bit in the trunks, then turn around, bend over, drop trou, and give everyone the goods. I pound two margaritas to give me some nerve before I get in line with my fellow contestants. A woman with a squirt gun walks down the line shooting whiskey into everyone\u0027s mouth, while hundreds of drunken ladies in the crowd scream for us to take the stage, all of them hungry for more beer and more male self-debasement. I\u0027m ready to go.\u000A\u000ABut I\u0027ve got serious competition. Many of these men are Speedo-contest veterans, and they know it takes more than just showing off the banana hammock, especially given our less-than-stellar physiques. We\u0027re an oddly shaped, sporadically hairy group of men. A few guys ahead of me in line is Randy, a short, furry guy who pulls off his suit to reveal that he\u0027s wearing his wife\u0027s panties. The crowd roars in approval. Randy tells me his wife demanded that he wear them: \u0022She said it would be hot. I just wanna make her happy.\u0022 There\u0027s also a guy with a stuffed chicken glued to his package (a cock, get it?) and another dude with a stuffed monkey down there. Right in front of me is Aaron, a skinny fellow who has a utility belt of Coors Light bottles around his waist and a blonde woman firing him up by shouting at him, over and over, \u0022You\u0027re gonna fucking win!\u0022 All I have is CUCCI GALORE. I may be outgunned.\u000A\u000AI do my best anyway, hopping up onto the table and pulling down my suit in rhythm to \u0022Eye of the Tiger.\u0022 Then I nudge down my briefs just a touch and give the crowd the Coppertone-girl look. My crack gets an enthusiastic reception. A cruise photographer snaps photos of my ass that will be broadcast later on the ship\u0027s in-house TV channel for all to see. I make it to the next round of the contest (O AN HE SEXY), only to be brought down by Aaron, the eventual champion, who ingeniously douses himself in ice-cold Coors Light every time he gets up on the table. His blonde companion is ecstatic.\u000A\u000A\u0022Are you Aaron\u0027s wife?\u0022 I ask her.\u000A\u000A\u0022No, I\u0027m his niece. I did all the choreography.\u0022\u000A\u000AI end up drowning my sorrows with Dave, last year\u0027s contest winner and this year\u0027s monkey stuffer. The sun and alcohol are doing a number on my system, and I\u0027m struggling to find the perfect drink to keep me lit but upright. I move from beer to margaritas, back to beer, then to rum and Cokes and finally, regrettably, to Red Bull and vodkas. \u0022That first day back home you\u0027re like, \u0027I\u0027m never gonna do it again,\u0027\u0022 says Dave, who\u0027s been on this cruise all four years. \u0022But you do. You always come back.\u0022 Shooter Jennings, son of Waylon, friend of Rock, will tell me later that night that the cruise is \u0022an athletic event in many ways.\u0022 He is not exaggerating. There is no traditional circadian rhythm on this boat, no day and night. There is only Drunk and Passed Out. Time itself is irrelevant.\u000A\u000AKid Rock takes the stage at Redneck Paradise the next day, and the crowd goes predictably batshit. They dance and drink and strip to their undies during the set as rebel flags fly and inflatable men and women again fill the air. One of the cruise operators sends a photo drone up into the air—a small white plastic robot with four whirring rotors—and more than a handful of women flash their boobs at it. FACELESS SURVEILLANCE PHOTOBOT YAY! No one is fighting. No one is angry. There\u0027s an oversize topless woman with Kid Rock pasties covering her nipples, dancing as her husband spoons her from behind. It\u0027s all lovin\u0027. That jail I mentioned earlier? That morgue? Nobody on this boat will see the inside of either all week.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A I meet Kid Rock in his top-deck suite after the show, and he spends most of the next four hours lying flat on a large circular sofa, with a hat that reads \u0027MERICA pulled low over his head. Beside him on the sofa is his girlfriend, Audrey, whose leg is in a cast after a recent rabbit-hunting accident late at night in Alabama. Never accuse Kid Rock or his people of faking the lifestyle.\u000A\u000AThe concert on the beach has taken a lot out of Rock, and now he\u0027s trying to recover for the next round of merriment. \u0022I was having little blackouts during the day,\u0022 he says. \u0022I\u0027d literally go black for, like, thirty minutes, and then I\u0027d be back. I\u0027m so used to doing the fucking drugs, and now I\u0027m not doing the drugs and it\u0027s a whole different ball game, drinking without fucking blow. Because I get so shitfaced, you know? Blow would always just level you out, and you\u0027re like, \u0027Hey, cool. I can fucking maintain.\u0027 And now I\u0027m, like, trying to leave that shit alone.  I\u0027m relearning to drink.\u0022\u000A\u000ATonight, his reeducation begins with a glass of low-end Pinot.\u000A\u000A\u0022I have good wine in the bedroom, babe,\u0022 Audrey says.\u000A\u000A\u0022This cheap stuff\u0027s fine for me.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe wine revives him, and soon Rock is lubricated enough to hold court. Like his fans, he\u0027s not letting fatigue or the ravages of binge-drinking affect his ability to  serve as raconteur. He talks about going to the Middle East:\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve been over there for the military so many times, and oh, I can\u0027t tell you, I hate that region. At least in Vietnam they had the fucking beers and dope. Robin Williams went to Iraq with us. It was him and Lewis Black and Lance Armstrong. And we got stuck at this base. Like, there was literally four bunk beds lined up, and we each had a handler. It was like camp. You know, it\u0027s dark, and Robin and Lewis just started making jokes, like, about our ordeal. And then Lance Armstrong won\u0027t stop farting. So every time there\u0027d be just a moment of silence and it\u0027d be like...[fart noise]...\u000A\u000AHe talks about why he\u0027ll never go on The View: \u000A\u000AFuckin\u0027 Barbara Walters called. She\u0027s like, \u0022When are you going to come on our program?\u0022 I was like, \u0022Ms. Walters, with all respect: five women at seven in the morning of all different ethnic backgrounds asking you questions? It just sounds like a nightmare to me. I can\u0027t think of anything worse.\u0022 \u000A\u000AHe talks about Justin Bieber:\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s just a matter of time before someone puts a huge line of cocaine in front of Bieber and he\u0027s going to be like, \u0022Yes! This is fucking awesome!\u0022 \u000A\u000AAnd Britney:\u000A\u000APoor girl. Turned into a space cadet. That dead stare, just fucking like someone stole her soul... \u000A\u000AAnd Kenny Chesney\u0027s awful taste in fine dining:\u000A\u000AIt must\u0027ve been twelve years ago, one of my first times ever really hanging out in Nashville, before I bought a place there. Kenny Chesney\u0027s gonna take me to dinner. I\u0027m like, \u0022Cool, I want to go eat some shit-kickin\u0027 stuff, back-porch home cooking\u0022—you know, barbecue, something like that. He goes, \u0022Meet me at P.F. Chang\u0027s.\u0022 And I\u0027d never heard of P.F. Chang\u0027s. And I\u0027m thinking, \u0022This is the spot!\u0022 I didn\u0027t know it was a chain or anything. I walk in there—I\u0027m like, \u0022Are you fucking kidding me?\u0022 And  of course Kenny\u0027s, like, getting—\u0022Mr. Chesney, would you like the usual?\u0022 and he\u0027s got, like, a little umbrella drink. I\u0027m like, \u0022Come on. Come on, Kenny.\u0022 I couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027m like, \u0022What is this fucking place?\u0022 He\u0027s like, \u0022Oh, it\u0027s my favorite restaurant.\u0022 This is the exact opposite of what I had in mind. \u000A\u000AEveryone laughs at Kenny Chesney, and now Bob is ready to rejoin his fans. But first, Monte and his brother-in-law are escorted into the suite bearing a gift: the special Wounded Warrior overalls airbrushed just for Rock. Rock rushes back to  his bedroom and throws them on immediately, sans shirt.\u000A\u000A\u0022The man who invented overalls was a fucking genius,\u0022 he says, \u0022because it\u0027s the most comfortable clothing ever.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe turns around and, sure enough, there are the gravestones from Arlington National Cemetery running down the back of his left thigh. And maybe it\u0027s just the Coors Light talking—Monte won\u0027t stop handing me beers—but it does look kinda badass.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m surprised I haven\u0027t died,\u0022 Shooter Jennings tells me. \u0022There was a lady last night going around with cocaine and water mid in a Visine bottle, and she was squirting it into people\u0027s drinks.\u0022\u000A\u000AWe\u0027re in a cordoned-off area with Rock and some of the other musicians, watching Lukas Nelson, Willie\u0027s son, play a set with his band. This is Shooter\u0027s first cruise. I ask him if he\u0027ll ever do another one.\u000A\u000A\u0022Right now I\u0027d say no, but ask me again in a few days. That first day, you\u0027re like, \u0027It\u0027s awesome! I\u0027m on a cruise! I\u0027m going to get wasted!\u0027 And the second day you\u0027re like, \u0027Yeah, I\u0027m on a cruise! Let\u0027s go do that again!\u0027 And then the third day you\u0027re like, \u0027Oh, my God. Time out.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s getting near midnight, and here on this same deck the Redneck Prom is about to begin. Most nights on the boat have their own costume theme: Wednesday night was Pimps Hos night. Thursday night was camouflage night. Virtually every cruiser has packed elaborate costumes for each of these events, and I marvel at their ability to travel by air and by sea lugging around cheetah platform shoes and 3-D camo-leaf hunting gear. You are expected to make a spectacle of yourself for the sake of your  shipmates, and the passengers don\u0027t let one another down.\u000A\u000AKid Rock takes a seat near the stage as the prom contestants are paraded out for the crowd\u0027s approval. There\u0027s a giant bearded man wearing suspenders and drinking from a foam dome. There\u0027s a husband-and-wife team carrying a baby doll covered in blood with a fake umbilical cord running under the wife\u0027s dress. (She gave birth in the high school bathroom, you see.) There are numerous sets of fake hillbilly teeth. A sunburned woman dressed in nothing more than a bunch of taped-together Budweiser cartons hops onstage only to have the whole costume fall apart, leaving her naked. She runs and leaps into Kid Rock\u0027s lap before security has a chance to  escort her away.\u000A\u000AAt the stroke of midnight, the crowd anoints a king and queen, with Foam Dome Guy and one half of the bleeding-fetus couple claiming the top honors. Rock sticks around to blast tracks—including some unreleased material—from his iPod. He\u0027ll be here all night, until well after sunrise, shitfaced beyond all recognition. I have no idea how he does it.\u000A\u000AThen again, it\u0027s his job. After three nights of trying to keep up with both Kid Rock and his crew, it becomes clear to me that partying is a patriotic duty for many of these folks. There is a clear sense of mission on this boat. Partying your ass off for five straight days is an act of rebellion, a way of telling the world that a shitty economy and terrorism and all the dirty liberals ain\u0027t gonna stop you from getting your rocks off. To party this hard takes genuine effort, and community. And it\u0027s hard not to admire the zeal of these folks, not to mention their seemingly indestructible livers. I get why people come back every year, and I get why they stay friends for life. I\u0027m gonna miss Bob and Monte and Shooter and Sparkle Tits. I really am.\u000A\u000ASoon we\u0027ll be back in Miami, but there\u0027s still time left for one final lovefest between Kid Rock and his adoring fans. On Saturday afternoon, he takes the stage for a third time, Bloody Mary in hand, to do a QA session with the crowd. Every word he utters is greeted with delirious cheers.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s a big fucked-up family!\u0022 he declares. \u0022It\u0027s awesome! Whether you like the music or not, it\u0027s fucking great people-watching, right? And we all make that happen for each other. We\u0027re being cordially different for each other.\u0022\u000A\u000AThen Rock stares down at the stage, gathering his thoughts.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m fuckin\u0027 drunk. Every year I do this, I\u0027m fuckin\u0027 shitfaced.\u0022\u000A\u000A Drew Magary is a GQ correspondent and a staff writer for Deadspin.

it—let&#39;s pour out some PBR for the sadly canceled Sugar Ray cruise. But there&#39;s one boat that&#39;s been packed from stem to stern since it launched, with more than half its passengers coming back for another drunken voyage. Its captain is Kid Rock, and its name is the Chillin&#39; the Most Cruise. <em>GQ&#39;</em>s Drew Magary set sail with 2,000 of America&#39;s reddest rednecks, and his liver will never be the same</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.0"> Kid Rock knows something that you and I don&apos;t. He&apos;s figured out the secret&#x2014;the dirty, nasty, well-kept secret of American life, which is that rednecks, in general, have more fun than uppity liberal folk like me. If you&apos;re a redneck, you&apos;re not dropping $2,300 a month to live in a Park Slope utility closet. The radio plays songs you actually like. You&apos;re not waiting in line for hours to eat at a trendy restaurant that doesn&apos;t take reservations, because Applebee&apos;s is A-OK with you. Also A-OK: cheap, mass-produced beer. Plus, you get to shoot guns all the time. It&apos;s a remarkably enjoyable lifestyle, and the annual Kid Rock theme cruise, officially called Kid Rock&apos;s Chillin&apos; the Most Cruise, now in its fourth year, is meant to be a raucous celebration of it, with Rock&#x2014;a man who countrified the concept of &quot;keeping it real&quot;&#x2014;as its Pied Piper.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1">There are 2,435 of us sailing out with Rock from Miami on the <em>Norwegian Pearl</em>, and only 1,001 are here for the first time, including me, which explains the virgin tag that will be hanging around my neck for the next five days. The remaining 1,434 passengers are returning for their second, third, even fourth time. They get tags that say VETERAN. It&apos;s an astonishing retention rate, and it explains why more and more musicians are ignoring stereotypes about cruises being a floating graveyard for washed-up acts. Not all of them succeed&#x2014;Sugar Ray&apos;s &apos;90s-nostalgia cruise was canceled in February. But when you find the right match of artist and audience, miracles (and nudity) can happen.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.2">From Miami, our cruise will sail to Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas, a tiny island owned by Norwegian Cruise Line that can be dressed up as a different island every week, depending upon which theme cruise is coming to port. Last fall, it served as headquarters for the KISS Navy. This week the cay will be rechristened Redneck Paradise (after the Kid Rock song). Then we head back out to sea for one more night before arriving back in Miami, where we will hopefully arrive free of Legionnaires&apos; disease. Two years ago, Kid Rock&apos;s cruise was held aboard the <em>Carnival Triumph</em>, a vessel that became infamous this past February when its engine died at sea and it had to be towed to Alabama, with passengers shitting into paper bags and subsisting on onion sandwiches. (This year&apos;s Kid Rock cruise is on a different boat.  &quot;I can&apos;t believe my name didn&apos;t come up in that,&quot; he will tell me later. &quot;I was waiting for it to be like, &apos;Kid Rock pooped on that boat!&apos; &quot;) With any luck, the <em>Pearl</em> will spare us such indignities, because we have <em>other</em> indignities planned.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.3">The ship is huge. HUGE. It&apos;s the kind of ship you gawk at from the highway. It&apos;s nearly 1,000 feet long and fifteen stories high. For our voyage, it has been stocked with 26,000 eggs, 357 gallons of ice cream, 8,000 pounds of beef, 1,484 pounds of cheese, and 643 pounds of coffee. There&apos;s also 12,568 pounds of fruit, none of which will be eaten.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.5">I walk to my room along one of the ship&apos;s many vast hallways. There&apos;s a door-decorating contest going on all week, and the passengers are putting everything they have into it. One cabin door is festooned with a dozen old <em>Playboy</em> centerfolds. Another has a sign blaring JAM OUT WITH YOUR CLAM OUT. In the hallway, I pass by one woman alerting a crew member named Carlos for help dragging her shitfaced friend back to their cabin. &quot;Carlos, we got a drunk one here!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.6">We are still in the port.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.7">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.8"> As this ship&apos;s honorary captain, Kid Rock has a number of contractual duties. He must play two shows&#x2014;one as we leave Miami and a second show two days later over at Redneck Paradise&#x2014;and participate in at least one nonmusical activity: beers and bingo, the belly-flop contest, etc. This will not be a problem for Kid Rock, as I quickly find out that few musicians enjoy communing with their fans, while just as shitfaced as they are, more than the man christened Bob Ritchie.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.9">By the time I get up to the pool deck to watch Rock&apos;s opening show, the party has started without me. There are enormous sunburned men with motion-sickness patches behind their ears shouting out, <em>&quot;I&apos;m on a boat, motherfucker!&quot;</em> Two women are carrying around an inflatable man with a giant dong sticking out. There are games of flip cup and cornhole in progress. There are joints being fired up all over the place. There are buckets upon buckets of cold ones dotting the deck. There are drunk wives being dragged out of the crowd by their loving husbands. And there are people frolicking in the three hot tubs near the stage. A few of the bathers got into the tubs fully clothed, then began removing their wardrobe piece by wet piece.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.a">Most of the people here are over 40, and jacked as they are to see their redneck hero take the stage, they seem even more excited to see <em>one another</em>. The close quarters and jam-packed days on a cruise make for intense friendships, ones that linger long after the cruise is over. &quot;We have friends for twenty years that we never see anymore,&quot; one lady tells me. &quot;We just hang out with the cruise people now.&quot; It&apos;s a very familiar vibe, and that extends to Rock himself. No one on the ship calls him &quot;Kid Rock.&quot; He&apos;s Bob or Bobby to everyone.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.b">As we wait for Rock to take the stage on deck 12, a couple I meet share a valuable piece of cruise-drinking advice. &quot;Always ask for the wheelchair,&quot; says the wife. &quot;Because then they&apos;ll roll you back to the cabin if you&apos;re too shitfaced to stand.&quot; There are nine people aboard who are actually disabled, and I spend the rest of the cruise trying to figure out who&apos;s got ALS and who is merely drunk  beyond functionality.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.c">At 5 p.m., Rock comes on wearing a bright pink shirt and plays his version of &quot;Sea Cruise,&quot; then runs through a bunch of his hits. This is by no means a token appearance: Rock plays for two solid hours. He plays for so long that hardly anyone, including me, notices that we&apos;ve actually left port and are heading out to sea.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.d">After the concert ends, the crowd scatters and I find myself standing in a war zone of crushed lime wedges, bottle caps, and shattered plastic. Beside one of the hot tubs, there&apos;s a Heineken Light bucket filled with warm vomit. The sun falls behind the quickly diminishing skyline of Miami, and I walk up to a group of enormous men outfitted in denim overalls that have been meticulously airbrushed with Kid Rock in various poses. One of them, a giant ripped bald guy named Monte, works as a financial adviser back home in Du Quoin, Illinois.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.e">&quot;Did you go in the hot tub?&quot; he asks me.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.f">&quot;No, but I definitely saw some naked people in there,&quot; I say.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.g">&quot;I would <em>not</em> go in that hot tub if I were you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.h">The men tell me their overalls were designed by a friend back in Du Quoin. On the 2011 cruise, Kid Rock saw their threads and brought the boys up to the VIP area. Now they are back to hand-deliver a custom pair to Bobby.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;The pair this year has the <em>Rebel Soul</em> theme with the helicopter, and it says LET&apos;S RIDE across it,&quot; Monte tells me. &quot;And on the back, it has the Wounded Warrior logo. And then below that, it says NEVER FORGET across the ass, and then below that on the left is the Arlington National Cemetery. It&apos;s like tombstones are going off in the distance. Badass.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.j">Monte hands me a beer, and I tell him I&apos;ll buy him one in return. He smiles and politely refuses the offer.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.k">&quot;No way, man. You&apos;re family now.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.l">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.m"> There is a jail on the <em>Pearl</em>&#x2014;a plain white room located in the bowels of the ship, with a dirty foam mattress and a dim fluorescent light. It&apos;s like being locked inside a vault: confinement within confinement. Last week&apos;s cruise, which was hosted by 311, had a number of scofflaws, including a &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; who got so high she tried to scale down the front of the ship. The ship&apos;s nurse will tell me that she ended up dangling from one of the wiper blades outside the captain&apos;s bridge. There was also a woman from New Jersey who died on that cruise. Possible heart attack. They stored her in the ship&apos;s morgue&#x2014;a small closet with room for two cadavers. Later, the nurse will show me the dead woman&apos;s toe tag.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.n">On the first morning, there&apos;s a rumor that Kid Rock is plowed and doing shots in one of the hot tubs. But by the time word has spread from stem to stern, he&apos;s gone. He&apos;s like a redneck phantom. I overhear one woman as she laments missing her chance to get wet with Bobby. &quot;I should really be a better stalker,&quot; she says.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.o">I head for the breakfast buffet. Before entering, for this or any other meal, you are encouraged to get a squirt of Purell from a lady guarding the doors. Every time you get a squirt, she says, &quot;Washy washy! Happy happy!&quot; This will become a running joke among the passengers. By the end of the trip, everyone is saying hi  to one another by shouting, &quot;WASHY WASHY, MOTHERFUCKER!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.p">It&apos;s relatively subdued in here, at least compared with last night, when a woman with huge fake tits and two glittery pasties that looked like tiny starbursts was posing for photographs right next to the soft-serve ice cream bar. She could even flex her boobs individually without touching them. A few feet away, a 13-year-old boy (one of only three minors I see the entire week) saw Sparkle Tits while getting a glass of milk. This, surely, would&apos;ve been the greatest moment of his young life, were it not for the fact that his mother was standing <em>right there</em>, trying to distract him from Sparkle Tits while simultaneously refusing to acknowledge her existence.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.q">This morning, so far: no tits with my oatmeal. From my window, I can see Great Stirrup Cay. The beaches on the tiny, <em>Cast Away</em>-sized island were damaged this past fall during Hurricane Sandy, but Norwegian restored them. Now the island is ready to become Redneck Paradise.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.r">Once we arrive on the sand, the first activity of the day is the Lucky Bitch contest, in which various ladies get up on a picnic table and, like, do stuff to get the crowd excited. Tits, of course, play a vital role. One contestant asks, &quot;If I get naked, can I meet Kid Rock?&quot; The winner ends up being a buxom brunette named Tina who managed to keep her top off the longest. Her prize is a merch certificate (redeemable in the onboard gift shop), a plastic tiara, and a sash that says MISS LUCKY BITCH 2013. I ask Tina if she was happy to beat out some of the skinnier, blonder women up on the stage. &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; she says. &quot;And you know why I won?&quot;  She clutches her boobs. &quot;Because these are <em>real</em>. And bruised!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.s">The Speedo Contest, a just form of revenge for the Lucky Bitch contest, is next. I was offered a spot in the competition and didn&apos;t hesitate for a second before accepting. <em>GQ</em> didn&apos;t send me here to sit on my ass. Kid Rock and his fans want your participation. They crave it. They reward it. This is not a passive experience. You are meant to get very drunk and very naked and encourage others to do likewise. These people are busting their asses trying to have the time of their lives. It would be an insult not to make the same effort myself.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.t">The cruise organizers lend me a pair of Kid Rock women&apos;s underwear (close enough to a Speedo)&#x2014;a set of drum-tight black panties with Kid Rock&apos;s face silk-screened just to the left of my balls and his anthem-slash-motto CUCCI GALORE spread across my ass cheeks&#x2014;and now I&apos;ve got them on underneath my normal blue swim trunks. My strategy is a classic reveal: dance around for a bit in the trunks, then turn around, bend over, drop trou, and give everyone the goods. I pound two margaritas to give me some nerve before I get in line with my fellow contestants. A woman with a squirt gun walks down the line shooting whiskey into everyone&apos;s mouth, while hundreds of drunken ladies in the crowd scream for us to take the stage, all of them hungry for more beer and more male self-debasement. I&apos;m ready to go.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.u">But I&apos;ve got serious competition. Many of these men are Speedo-contest veterans, and they know it takes more than just showing off the banana hammock, especially given our less-than-stellar physiques. We&apos;re an oddly shaped, sporadically hairy group of men. A few guys ahead of me in line is Randy, a short, furry guy who pulls off his suit to reveal that he&apos;s wearing his wife&apos;s panties. The crowd roars in approval. Randy tells me his wife demanded that he wear them: &quot;She said it would be hot. I just wanna make her happy.&quot; There&apos;s also a guy with a stuffed chicken glued to his package (a cock, get it?) and another dude with a stuffed monkey down there. Right in front of me is Aaron, a skinny fellow who has a utility belt of Coors Light bottles around his waist and a blonde woman firing him up by shouting at him, over and over, &quot;You&apos;re gonna fucking win!&quot; All I have is CUCCI GALORE. I may be outgunned.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.v">I do my best anyway, hopping up onto the table and pulling down my suit in rhythm to &quot;Eye of the Tiger.&quot; Then I nudge down my briefs just a touch and give the crowd the Coppertone-girl look. My crack gets an enthusiastic reception. A cruise photographer snaps photos of my ass that will be broadcast later on the ship&apos;s in-house TV channel for all to see. I make it to the next round of the contest (O AN HE SEXY), only to be brought down by Aaron, the eventual champion, who ingeniously douses himself in ice-cold Coors Light every time he gets up on the table. His blonde companion is ecstatic.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.w">&quot;Are you Aaron&apos;s wife?&quot; I ask her.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.x">&quot;No, I&apos;m his niece. I did <em>all</em> the choreography.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.y">I end up drowning my sorrows with Dave, last year&apos;s contest winner and this year&apos;s monkey stuffer. The sun and alcohol are doing a number on my system, and I&apos;m struggling to find the perfect drink to keep me lit but upright. I move from beer to margaritas, back to beer, then to rum and Cokes and finally, regrettably, to Red Bull and vodkas. &quot;That first day back home you&apos;re like, &apos;I&apos;m never gonna do it again,&apos;&quot; says Dave, who&apos;s been on this cruise all four years. &quot;But you do. You always come back.&quot; Shooter Jennings, son of Waylon, friend of Rock, will tell me later that night that the cruise is &quot;an athletic event in many ways.&quot; He is not exaggerating. There is no traditional circadian rhythm on this boat, no day and night. There is only Drunk and Passed Out. Time itself is irrelevant.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.z">Kid Rock takes the stage at Redneck Paradise the next day, and the crowd goes predictably batshit. They dance and drink and strip to their undies during the set as rebel flags fly and inflatable men and women again fill the air. One of the cruise operators sends a photo drone up into the air&#x2014;a small white plastic robot with four whirring rotors&#x2014;and more than a handful of women flash their boobs at it. FACELESS SURVEILLANCE PHOTOBOT YAY! No one is fighting. No one is angry. There&apos;s an oversize topless woman with Kid Rock pasties covering her nipples, dancing as her husband spoons her from behind. It&apos;s all lovin&apos;. That jail I mentioned earlier? That morgue? Nobody on this boat will see the inside of either all week.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.10">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.11"> I meet Kid Rock in his top-deck suite after the show, and he spends most of the next four hours lying flat on a large circular sofa, with a hat that reads &apos;MERICA pulled low over his head. Beside him on the sofa is his girlfriend, Audrey, whose leg is in a cast after a recent rabbit-hunting accident late at night in Alabama. Never accuse Kid Rock or his people of faking the lifestyle.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.12">The concert on the beach has taken a lot out of Rock, and now he&apos;s trying to recover for the next round of merriment. &quot;I was having little blackouts during the day,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;d literally go black for, like, thirty minutes, and then I&apos;d be back. I&apos;m so used to doing the fucking drugs, and now I&apos;m not doing the drugs and it&apos;s a whole different ball game, drinking without fucking blow. Because I get so shitfaced, you know? Blow would always just level you out, and you&apos;re like, &apos;Hey, cool. I can fucking maintain.&apos; And now I&apos;m, like, trying to leave that shit alone.  I&apos;m relearning to drink.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.13">Tonight, his reeducation begins with a glass of low-end Pinot.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.14">&quot;I have good wine in the bedroom, babe,&quot; Audrey says.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.15">&quot;This cheap stuff&apos;s fine for me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.16">The wine revives him, and soon Rock is lubricated enough to hold court. Like his fans, he&apos;s not letting fatigue or the ravages of binge-drinking affect his ability to  serve as raconteur. He talks about going to the Middle East:</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.17"><em>I&apos;ve been over there for the military so many times, and oh, I can&apos;t tell you, I hate that region. At least in Vietnam they had the fucking beers and dope. Robin Williams went to Iraq with us. It was him and Lewis Black and Lance Armstrong. And we got stuck at this base. Like, there was literally four bunk beds lined up, and we each had a handler. It was like camp. You know, it&apos;s dark, and Robin and Lewis just started making jokes, like, about our ordeal. And then Lance Armstrong won&apos;t stop farting. So every time there&apos;d be just a moment of silence and it&apos;d be like</em>...[fart noise]...</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.18">He talks about why he&apos;ll never go on <em>The View: </em></p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.19"><em>Fuckin&apos; Barbara Walters called. She&apos;s like, &quot;When are you going to come on our program?&quot; I was like, &quot;Ms. Walters, with all respect: five women at seven in the morning of all different ethnic backgrounds asking you questions? It just sounds like a nightmare to me. I can&apos;t think of anything worse.&quot; </em></p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1a">He talks about Justin Bieber:</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><em>It&apos;s just a matter of time before someone puts a huge line of cocaine in front of Bieber and he&apos;s going to be like, &quot;Yes! This is fucking awesome!&quot; </em></p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1c">And Britney:</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><em>Poor girl. Turned into a space cadet. That dead stare, just fucking like someone stole her soul... </em></p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1e">And Kenny Chesney&apos;s awful taste in fine dining:</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><em>It must&apos;ve been twelve years ago, one of my first times ever really hanging out in Nashville, before I bought a place there. Kenny Chesney&apos;s gonna take me to dinner. I&apos;m like, &quot;Cool, I want to go eat some shit-kickin&apos; stuff, back-porch home cooking&quot;&#x2014;you know, barbecue, something like that. He goes, &quot;Meet me at P.F. Chang&apos;s.&quot; And I&apos;d never heard of P.F. Chang&apos;s. And I&apos;m thinking, &quot;This is the spot!&quot; I didn&apos;t know it was a chain or anything. I walk in there&#x2014;I&apos;m like, &quot;Are you fucking kidding me?&quot; And  of course Kenny&apos;s, like, getting&#x2014;&quot;Mr. Chesney, would you like the usual?&quot; and he&apos;s got, like, a little umbrella drink. I&apos;m like, &quot;Come on. Come on, Kenny.&quot; I couldn&apos;t believe it. I&apos;m like, &quot;What is this fucking place?&quot; He&apos;s like, &quot;Oh, it&apos;s my favorite restaurant.&quot; This is the exact opposite of what I had in mind. </em></p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1g">Everyone laughs at Kenny Chesney, and now Bob is ready to rejoin his fans. But first, Monte and his brother-in-law are escorted into the suite bearing a gift: the special Wounded Warrior overalls airbrushed just for Rock. Rock rushes back to  his bedroom and throws them on immediately, sans shirt.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1h">&quot;The man who invented overalls was a fucking genius,&quot; he says, &quot;because it&apos;s the most comfortable clothing ever.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1i">He turns around and, sure enough, there are the gravestones from Arlington National Cemetery running down the back of his left thigh. And maybe it&apos;s just the Coors Light talking&#x2014;Monte won&apos;t stop handing me beers&#x2014;but it <em>does</em> look kinda badass.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1j">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1k"> &quot;I&apos;m surprised I haven&apos;t died,&quot; Shooter Jennings tells me. &quot;There was a lady last night going around with cocaine and water mid in a Visine bottle, and she was squirting it into people&apos;s drinks.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1l">We&apos;re in a cordoned-off area with Rock and some of the other musicians, watching Lukas Nelson, Willie&apos;s son, play a set with his band. This is Shooter&apos;s first cruise. I ask him if he&apos;ll ever do another one.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1m">&quot;Right now I&apos;d say no, but ask me again in a few days. That first day, you&apos;re like, &apos;It&apos;s awesome! I&apos;m on a cruise! I&apos;m going to get wasted!&apos; And the second day you&apos;re like, &apos;Yeah, I&apos;m on a cruise! Let&apos;s go do that again!&apos; And then the third day you&apos;re like, &apos;Oh, my God. Time out.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1n">It&apos;s getting near midnight, and here on this same deck the Redneck Prom is about to begin. Most nights on the boat have their own costume theme: Wednesday night was Pimps Hos night. Thursday night was camouflage night. Virtually every cruiser has packed elaborate costumes for each of these events, and I marvel at their ability to travel by air and by sea lugging around cheetah platform shoes and 3-D camo-leaf hunting gear. You are expected to make a spectacle of yourself for the sake of your  shipmates, and the passengers don&apos;t let one another down.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1o">Kid Rock takes a seat near the stage as the prom contestants are paraded out for the crowd&apos;s approval. There&apos;s a giant bearded man wearing suspenders and drinking from a foam dome. There&apos;s a husband-and-wife team carrying a baby doll covered in blood with a fake umbilical cord running under the wife&apos;s dress. (She gave birth in the high school bathroom, you see.) There are numerous sets of fake hillbilly teeth. A sunburned woman dressed in nothing more than a bunch of taped-together Budweiser cartons hops onstage only to have the whole costume fall apart, leaving her naked. She runs and leaps into Kid Rock&apos;s lap before security has a chance to  escort her away.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1p">At the stroke of midnight, the crowd anoints a king and queen, with Foam Dome Guy and one half of the bleeding-fetus couple claiming the top honors. Rock sticks around to blast tracks&#x2014;including some unreleased material&#x2014;from his iPod. He&apos;ll be here all night, until well after sunrise, shitfaced beyond all recognition. I have no idea how he does it.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1q">Then again, it&apos;s his job. After three nights of trying to keep up with both Kid Rock and his crew, it becomes clear to me that partying is a patriotic duty for many of these folks. There is a clear sense of mission on this boat. Partying your ass off for five straight days is an act of rebellion, a way of telling the world that a shitty economy and terrorism and all the dirty liberals ain&apos;t gonna stop you from getting your rocks off. To party this hard takes genuine effort, and community. And it&apos;s hard not to admire the zeal of these folks, not to mention their seemingly indestructible livers. I get why people come back every year, and I get why they stay friends for life. I&apos;m gonna miss Bob and Monte and Shooter and Sparkle Tits. I really am.</p><p data-reactid=".108y3vqpfcw.1.1.0.0.4.1r">Soon we&apos;ll be back in Miami, but there&apos;s still time left for one final lovefest between Kid Rock and his adoring fans.
