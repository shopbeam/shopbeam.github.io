  	    "articleBody": "When I arrive at the house in the Hollywood Hills that Chris Pratt shares with his wife, the comic actress Anna Faris, and their 2 1/2-year-old son, Jack, Pratt has just returned from a long early-morning bike ride. He is getting in shape for three forthcoming movies and also preparing for a triathlon in a few weeks\u0027 time, something he was talked into by a good friend, a Navy Seal whom he met while making Zero Dark Thirty. This is the sort of thing you might expect from the new Chris Pratt—the one who posts six-pack selfies on Instagram, the one whose last movie, Guardians of the Galaxy, grossed nearly $800 million worldwide and re-invented him from a bumbling, chubby sitcom sidekick into everyone\u0027s favorite new movie star (a status he hopes to bolster with this month\u0027s Jurassic World). In other words, the one who has undergone a parallel physical and professional transformation without obvious precedent in Hollywood.\u000A\u000APratt\u0027s road here, to this career and this body, has been unlikely and meandering. When he first auditioned for movies in his early twenties he would try out for all kinds of roles, but he soon fell into the first of the two stereotypical parts that would fill up his next decade. \u0022Typically, I was getting typecast as the bad boyfriend. The boyfriend of the girl who you hope ends up with the guy you like. That was my bread and butter for a long time,\u0022 he says. He\u0027s had a quick shower and has lit a cigar—some combination of late-morning pleasure and character prep for his next movie, The Magnificent Seven. \u0022Looking back, I think I know why. Physically, I looked like an asshole.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat do you mean?\u000A\u000A\u0022I looked like the guy—like Johnny in The Karate Kid, you know?\u0022\u000A\u000ASlowly he worked to at least make these roles funnier. \u0022I always had thought my strongest ability was improvisational comedy,\u0022 he says. \u0022I was always adding stuff to scenes and the directors would be like, \u0027Come on, man, no, don\u0027t do that.\u0027 And then that stuff would make the cut. And I was like, \u0027I knew it! I knew I was funnier than that stupid fucking director, and he didn\u0027t know what the fuck he was talking about! I knew it!\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ASoon Pratt was actually being cast for his comic instincts. And with the greater emphasis on comedy came a gradual physical transformation, one that became unavoidably apparent to him as he watched himself on-screen early in the second season of Parks and Recreation. \u0022I saw myself and I thought, \u0027Wow, I\u0027m getting fat.\u0027 And then immediately I was like, \u0027This is the funniest...\u0027 I was making myself laugh. I was: \u0027That\u0027s where it\u0027s at. There\u0027s no one doing that. No one being like a super-confident dumb fat guy.\u0027 So I started.\u0022 He told the showrunner that he wanted to get even larger, and was enthusiastically encouraged to do so. \u0022So I just got fatter,\u0022 he says, \u0022and the laughs kept coming, and it was funnier and funnier. And in that moment I was like, \u0027Oh great, I found my niche—this is paying better than the asshole-boyfriend parts.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AIf you read or watch the interviews Chris Pratt did in the comedy years, he played the part of the happy plump man to perfection. But he may just have been fooling us and fooling himself at the same time. \u0022I\u0027m sure I was the first guy in line to buy that line of bullshit,\u0022 he says now. \u0022I also understood that there was value to it—my comedic nature understood the irony of a super-happy fat sweaty guy who is completely confident and accepting of who he was. That\u0027s fascinating to people. I mean, I was never as big as Chris Farley, but you look at Chris Farley—that\u0027s what made him so magical. Because other people look just like him, and they\u0027re like, \u0027Why is this guy not crippled with self-doubt? Fuck, that\u0027s awesome. I wish I could feel that way.\u0027 Well, I don\u0027t think Chris Farley did feel that way. I think he killed himself with drugs and alcohol and buried himself in an addiction to hide the fact that he didn\u0027t feel what he was projecting on the outside. I think that\u0027s often the case with comedians.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn the past year or two, Pratt, who turns 36 this month, has become more candid about casting those years in a less joyful light, explaining that the highlights of his days were the eating and drinking but that the rest wasn\u0027t so good, that he felt physically and mentally sluggish and \u0022didn\u0027t feel too great about who I was.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe nods when I bring this up and elaborates. \u0022My bones ached, I had cardiovascular issues, I was unhealthy, I was feeling rotten.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo for instance, would you openly discuss with your wife, say: \u0022I wish my body wasn\u0027t like this—I don\u0027t want to be like this\u0022?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. But she was so okay with it. Probably in many ways preferred me that way.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhy?\u000A\u000A\u0022I think I was outwardly having more fun. I was more fun to be around, probably. That image that I was casting, to convince people that I was okay, was a really fun person to hang around. Now I have less fun. I focus more. She doesn\u0027t get to cook for me the way she used to.\u0022 He laughs. \u0022I was like a great pet fat guy.\u0022\u000A\u000ADoes she actively complain that you\u0027re less fun?\u000A\u000A\u0022No, she understands and she just supports me regardless. I think that part of her is hedging her bets that one day I\u0027ll be fat again, and she\u0027ll say, \u0027Remember, honey, I always told you I preferred you this way.\u0027 She\u0027s probably just playing the long game.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAn aside about nudity: What were you like as a young kid?\u000A\u000A\u0022Obnoxious. I was obnoxious, really hyperactive, disruptive...but also Dad was very, very strict, so if I got yelled at, I would stay silent for a long period of time. I was really sensitive. I cried a lot. I was a crybaby for a long time. And kind of perverted. I was like a little perv.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn what way?\u000A\u000A\u0022I was a jokester, I had a dirty mind, and a dirty sense of humor. And I was naked a lot. I was naked all the time. It was just recently, in the last few years since I\u0027ve become an adult, that I\u0027ve learned to keep my clothes on. And even then, I really haven\u0027t. I got yelled at by NBC for getting naked. [While filming multiple takes of a Parks and Recreation scene in which he was supposed to shock Amy Poehler by being naked in a doorway, in one take he did it for real.] I got suspended from the track team in high school for getting naked on the track bus. I was always getting naked. I thought it was hilarious. I didn\u0027t understand how somebody could be so offended by me just taking my junk out.\u0022\u000A\u000ADid NBC explain it to you?\u000A\u000A\u0022They did—they sent me a letter. HR sent me a letter. Someone obviously must have complained about it or something. I guess now that I don\u0027t work for them, I can make fun of it, but part of the letter was saying, like, \u0027Also, don\u0027t mock this. Just so we\u0027re clear, you\u0027re being reprimanded, and don\u0027t go around talking about how this is funny.\u0027 [It was] the take they fucking used, by the way, that made the air, and was hilarious, so I was totally right, but apparently if you want to get naked there\u0027s certain protocols you have to take to prevent people from being offended—you have to give them the opportunity to not see it. But that\u0027s how I was in high school, too. I remember walking into the coach\u0027s office with just a sock on. Not on my feet. And I was like, \u0027Hey, Coach, can I talk to you?\u0027 And they were like, \u0027Jesus, God!\u0027 \u0022 He grins. \u0022I liked making people feel uncomfortable.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGuardians of the Galaxy was the making of Pratt, but however effortless it may have seemed on-screen, the movie\u0027s deft combination of action and comedy, sincerity and levity, didn\u0027t come easily.\u000A\u000A\u0022[Guardians director] James Gunn had a hard time working with me for about the first half of the movie,\u0022 Pratt explains. \u0022He\u0027ll say—and I wouldn\u0027t want to be quoted [sounding like I was] saying this about myself—I\u0027m a much more cerebral person than you may expect. You may see this guy who\u0027s sort of like goofy and funny and doesn\u0027t give two shits, but really I\u0027m thinking a lot, in my head below the surface.\u0022 Too much, in fact, so that sometimes Pratt would lose track of the natural instincts Gunn had liked. \u0022It\u0027s a little bit like a Venus flytrap,\u0022 says Pratt. \u0022If you stick your finger in and it closes, it takes like a week to open back up. So he had a hard time working with me because he\u0027d tell me something, or I\u0027d do something, and the next thing you know he couldn\u0027t get me back to where I started originally.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I think that he had gotten a lot of success over the past few years being the funny sidekick,\u0022 says Gunn, \u0022which means that he always has to juggle to entertain everybody. And the truth is, Chris didn\u0027t trust himself to just be Chris Pratt—and how desirable that is to an audience.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I thought I was bad,\u0022 Pratt concurs. \u0022I thought I was doing bad acting. I would just think: My bullshit meter\u0027s going off. This screams inauthentic to me.\u0022 Pratt says that Gunn had little patience with this. \u0022He\u0027s like, \u0027Who gives a shit what you think? I don\u0027t fucking care!\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027d literally say that?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yes! He\u0027d be, \u0027It\u0027s not your fucking movie, dude, it\u0027s mine! Trust me and shut the fuck up and do what the fuck I tell you, and scream it!\u0027 He\u0027s like, \u0027More! Louder!\u0027 I would get pissy because as an actor, you sometimes hate that direction: Louder, faster. But it\u0027s true—sometimes you have to be louder, speak more clearly, let the words do the work, and just get out of the way.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I think being the center of focus on the actual movie set,\u0022 says Gunn, \u0022and having to learn this balance, which I think he had never learned before, of both allowing himself to be the center of attention while simultaneously realizing in what areas he is completely unimportant—that\u0027s what being a movie star is, and it\u0027s a very difficult balance for someone to learn.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAn aside about Kim Kardashian: Pratt made a steady stream of movies early in his career, but few of them are memorable in any particularly good way. A representative example is 2009\u0027s Deep in the Valley, in which Pratt\u0027s character and a friend find themselves magically transported to a world inhabited by porn stars continually acting out stereotypical porn-film scenarios. \u0022First time I was ever number one on the call sheet,\u0022 he says. \u0022But, uh, it is not good.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn the film, Pratt had a brief, lewd scene with Kim Kardashian, who played a kind of porn-world bouncer. (\u0022She\u0027d never really done an acting gig before,\u0022 he says. \u0022She was so fucking sweet, and she was nervous.\u0022) Years later he ran into Kardashian on an airplane, but by then he was hoping she wouldn\u0027t notice him because now he had a new embarrassment he wished to sidestep. While filming an episode of Parks and Recreation, Pratt—or his character, Andy—had ad-libbed a joke about her that he knew would never go in the show because it was too rude. \u0022It was a very, very funny joke,\u0022 he says. But it was also one he immediately thought shouldn\u0027t be heard in public, and so he had the foresight to request that it not be used on any future DVD gag reel.\u000A\u000AThe clip nonetheless surfaced, and Pratt says that it has become one of Andy\u0027s most viewed moments online. (He was told they\u0027d forgotten his request and he says he received an apology.) \u0022So it\u0027s really kind of a bummer,\u0022 says Pratt. \u0022She probably doesn\u0027t know or doesn\u0027t care, I\u0027m sure, but I don\u0027t like to make jokes at other people\u0027s expense, if I can help it.\u0022 He stops himself and reframes this rule more realistically. \u0022I like to keep my jokes about people safely way behind their backs. I\u0027m a shit-talker, but if I\u0027m gonna make a joke at someone\u0027s expense, I\u0027ll do it so that they can never hear it.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd so I suspect he\u0027d prefer the joke to remain unrepeated here. But for the record, it went like this:\u000A\u000AAmy Poehler\u0027s and Rashida Jones\u0027s characters are addressing a group of people, discussing good comeback stories. Seabiscuit, the Mighty Ducks, Robert Downey Jr., and Rocky are all mentioned before, to general bemusement, Andy offers his own suggestion.\u000A\u000A\u0022Kim Kardashian?\u0022 he pipes up.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well...,\u0022 says Poehler—in character dubious and out of character clearly wondering where he is going with this—but then Pratt, with guileless nonchalance, explains:\u000A\u000A\u0022In the video she gets come on her back, I think.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AYou might imagine that Pratt\u0027s approach to actually doing his job would be a mixture of diligent and devil-may-care instinctual, but it turns out that he employs a number of fairly unorthodox acting methods. It\u0027s when we are talking about Delivery Man, the 2013 Vince Vaughn movie in which Pratt bulked up to 295 pounds for a supporting role as a failed lawyer, that he unveils the first of these.\u000A\u000A\u0022I came up with some awesome techniques on that movie that I still use,\u0022 he declares. \u0022Some awesome techniques for acting that I think I might have invented.\u0022 Techniques, he explains, that are based on how the different wavelengths of color can affect you. \u0022In that movie, I used bright orange, like a blaze orange, as a reminder that my [character\u0027s] mother doesn\u0027t believe in me and that she believes I\u0027m a failure,\u0022 he explains. On the set, he would then sequester orange Post-it notes out of camera shot. \u0022Then,\u0022 he says, \u0022it would catch my attention halfway through the scene, and it would affect me emotionally underneath.\u0022\u000A\u000APratt also uses music in his acting, which in itself is not so unusual, though perhaps not many actors store 110 pieces of music in their phones under the title \u0022Acting Music,\u0022 subdivided into five categories: \u0022Love,\u0022 \u0022Sadness,\u0022 \u0022Wonderment,\u0022 \u0022Action,\u0022 and the vaguely mysterious \u0022Volume Five.\u0022 (Volume Five turns out to be \u0022a collection of kind of all of them.\u0022) Pratt then rechristens each separate piece of music—typically an instrumental from a past movie soundtrack—with its own new name to describe the emotion it encapsulates, so that within \u0022Sadness,\u0022 for instance, you can find \u0022Ethereal Reaction,\u0022 \u0022The Long Walk,\u0022 \u0022European Town in Ruins,\u0022 \u0022Wonder of Life,\u0022 \u0022Leaving Home,\u0022 and \u0022Brother\u0027s Funeral.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe way Pratt sees acting, the \u0022three legs of the acting table\u0022 are your body, your voice, and \u0022the rhythm of your spirit\u0022; he finds this music collection particularly useful with the third of these. \u0022It\u0027s hard to manipulate the rhythm of your spirit,\u0022 he points out. \u0022That\u0027s something I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about. Like, I had road rage just yesterday....\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd here Chris Pratt launches into a story about yesterday\u0027s road rage. He tells this story as a way of explaining how real-life experiences yield information that he can use as an actor, but you might also learn other things from it—for instance, about how fiercely, and not so far beneath Pratt\u0027s abundant charm and warmth, anger is bubbling away.\u000A\u000AThe story is about how he was cut off on the freeway, and his realization, in the midst of his fury, that this was a prime opportunity for Chris Pratt the actor to learn something about how real anger is expressed. He explains how he told himself not to hold back: \u0022 \u0027Just get mad. Just get fucking pissed at this cunt who just cut you off. This fucking bitch.\u0027 I was so mad. It cost me twenty minutes, because she wouldn\u0027t let me get over, and then I\u0027m fucking on some other freeway going the wrong way. I\u0027m running late. I was so pissed. And part of me was, \u0027Okay, great, this is great research—what do you look and sound like right now?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AWhen I ask a bit more about the traffic incident that triggered all of this, though, Pratt first echoes his original story (\u0022She cut me off, fucking bitch—I was mad as hell\u0022), but then his account takes an unexpected turn: \u0022No, I\u0027m sure she didn\u0027t. It was probably my fault for not paying attention. I\u0027ve got a terrible sense of direction. My mind is constantly wandering, and I get lost all the time. I go to the same diner for fifteen years, I\u0027m driving my wife there, and she\u0027s like, \u0027Honey, I think you might want to take this right here.\u0027 I\u0027ll end up in fucking Downtown. I do this all the time. It\u0027s kind of a bad habit.\u0022\u000A\u000AFor Jurassic World, he used another new acting technique, one he stumbled onto online. It\u0027s a technique where you think about which animal your character would be, and then use that information to determine which part of the body your character leads with when he moves. For this film, Pratt determined that the appropriate animal would be a dolphin. \u0022They lead with their foreheads,\u0022 he explains.\u000A\u000AOn Jurassic World, all of Pratt\u0027s ideas and approaches were combined into a kind of mantra that he would repeat to himself just before the camera rolled: \u0022Flow core, no TC, volume up point five, Eric Church.\u0022 Eric Church to remind him of \u0022Dark Side,\u0022 a song by Church that Pratt was listening to over and over, and the darkness in this character it encapsulated. \u0022Flow core\u0022 to remind him of his posture when he was paddleboarding. \u0022Volume up point five\u0022 to remind him to make his voice slightly louder. \u0022No TC\u0022 to remind him to lead with his forehead, in a formulation only a formerly fat man would think to use: No triple chin.\u000A\u000AI tell Pratt I have a hunch that very few movie stars Google for acting tips.\u000A\u000A\u0022Maybe they won\u0027t talk about it,\u0022 he says. \u0022Maybe that\u0027s my next lesson—just stop talking about it and be like, \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know what it is.... It\u0027s just a gift, I guess.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AHe concedes that not all his directors encourage his search for new tricks. James Gunn, he says, tells him, \u0022You always have a new thing you\u0027re doing—just stop.\u0022\u000A\u000AGunn demurs at the \u0022stop\u0022 part but says, \u0022Chris is a man of insights, and he\u0027s always having these big insights—he\u0027s got a new idea every day about everything.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFor most of their time together, Faris has been the more famous one (a renown that reached its peak with The House Bunny), and I ask Pratt whether it\u0027s weird in a marriage like this how the fame balance keeps readjusting itself.\u000A\u000A\u0022Mmm,\u0022 he considers, \u0022I think it probably could affect... I think it\u0027s something you have to manage. It\u0027s a little different, because she\u0027s achieved enough to hang her hat on for her life, anyways. She\u0027s done really amazing things—she\u0027s always gonna be known for really funny and great work, critically acclaimed work and successful stuff.\u0022 But he certainly remembers what it was like to be the less feted member of a Hollywood couple. \u0022I\u0027ve had those moments,\u0022 he says, \u0022where I was like the guy holding the purse at events and people just looked right through me. And, you know, actors come up and just blatantly hit on my wife in front of me and don\u0027t even look at me. I\u0027m like, \u0027What the fuck, dude?\u0027 I can think of exactly who they are, too, and I hope they fucking audition for Guardians of the Galaxy.\u0022 (A sequel, the first of at least two that Pratt says are already planned, begins filming next February.) There are others whose transgressions he hasn\u0027t forgotten: \u0022Also, producers and studio people now who will come up to me and treat me the same way that they were treating Anna. They\u0027re like, \u0027I always knew...\u0027 I\u0027m like, \u0027Is that right? That\u0027s interesting, because you fucking stared right through me the last time....\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAn aside about poop photos: You and Nick Offerman really send each other photos of each other\u0027s poop?\u000A\u000APratt laughs. \u0022Yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000AStill?\u000A\u000A\u0022Not like every poop, but if it\u0027s special enough. I sent him a picture of a giant turd on his birthday, and I said, \u0027You guys have the same birthday.\u0027 Adam Scott and I send each other goofy shit a lot, too. I\u0027ve sent some dumps to Adam, and he sent some to me.\u0022\u000A\u000AI guess I should ask why.\u000A\u000A\u0022Because we\u0027re buddies and it makes us laugh.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat makes a particular movement sendable?\u000A\u000A\u0022If it\u0027s shaped like a letter—that qualifies. Like, one time I had one that was three pieces that landed in the shape of an N—I was like, \u0027Gotta send that to Nick—it\u0027s his first initial!\u0027 If it\u0027s extra...the size. You know, some poops are unremarkable, and some you take pictures of and send them to Nick Offerman.\u0022\u000A\u000AHow do you feel when you receive a new one?\u000A\u000A\u0022Respect. That\u0027s how we are. You know how we know we respect the poops? Because we\u0027ll send them, not even a single square of toilet paper in the photo. We won\u0027t desecrate the art by obscuring even a corner of it with a piece of toilet paper. Which means that we will get up and take the photo before we wipe our ass, just out of sheer respect for the piece.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou feel like this might be a lifetime pursuit?\u000A\u000A\u0022I think so. I\u0027ll probably always send Nick one on his birthday.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000APratt tells me he hasn\u0027t even seen Jurassic World yet. \u0022They\u0027ve asked me if I wanted to come see it, and I\u0027m, \u0027Are all the dinosaurs completely done?\u0027 \u0022 he says. \u0022You only get to see it for the first time once.\u0022 But mostly he\u0027s looking to the future. He met with James Gunn this week to be briefed on the Guardians sequel for the first time. \u0022I got teary-eyed,\u0022 he says. \u0022He\u0027s so fucking smart and peculiar.\u0022 (Gunn declined to share the whole plot, Pratt says: \u0022He just knows me too well to tell me too much.\u0022)\u000A\u000AIn turn, Gunn tells me this: \u0022I said before we ever started shooting Guardians that Chris Pratt\u0027s the biggest movie star in the world, it\u0027s just that people don\u0027t know it yet. And that\u0027s the case.\u0022 As more people begin to share this opinion, one consequence is the way Pratt is routinely reported to be involved in multiple other new projects, often with a conviction that is confusing to him, given how wrong these reports typically are.\u000A\u000AFor instance, there is the widely and confidently reported story that he will be the next Indiana Jones. Pratt was on a four-day hunt on a Texas ranch when his manager and agent called to say that this \u0022fact\u0022 had exploded all over the Internet. \u0022And so I came home, and then there was paparazzi asking me about it and people asking me to sign Indiana Jones pictures and Indiana Jones hats,\u0022 he says. The truth, as far as he is concerned, is that someone high up at Disney did mention to him a while back that they were picking up the rights to Indiana Jones, to which Pratt commented that his action-adventure card was fairly full. (If Jurassic World does well, there will be sequels. And for the record, this is how he describes, almost more to himself than to me, his future Guardians of the Galaxy obligations: \u0022...I\u0027m tied to doing three more, or five more, Guardians of the Galaxy or whatever it is, you know, two more Guardians plus another couple...\u0022 I think this means he is committed to at least two sequels, as well as spin-off projects where his character will appear with other Marvel characters.) But as it happens, he\u0027s also been around Steven Spielberg a fair bit recently (Spielberg produced Jurassic World), both before and after this rumor broke. \u0022I just didn\u0027t bring it up and he didn\u0027t bring it up,\u0022 he says, \u0022so I don\u0027t know.\u0022\u000A\u000ASimilarly, it\u0027s also been rumored recently that he will appear in a Channing Tatum-produced Ghostbusters remake. Even less likely. \u0022No one has ever even spoken to me about that,\u0022 he says. \u0022Never. I\u0027ve even seen Channing a couple times. As far as I know, that\u0027s complete bullshit.\u0022 He ticks off others. \u0022Knight Rider—bullshit. All of them.\u0022 As we talk, a photo comes through on his phone. His son. \u0022My son went to the dentist for the first time today,\u0022 he says. \u0022Oh, my God, he\u0027s smiling. Oh, sweet boy!\u0022 Pratt tells me that he and Faris would like more kids. \u0022I had siblings, so did Anna—we both dream of it. Jack should have the gift of a little person to push around, whether we have kids or potentially have a surrogate or adopt kids. He was premature, and Anna\u0027s 38, so the idea of going through that again—that was tough, and I think, like, that\u0027s something to truly consider.\u0022\u000A\u000AEither way, he clearly thinks of Jack as a kind of reality check. \u0022I have a feeling I\u0027ll be tested and I\u0027ll have to prove to him that he\u0027s more important to me than show business,\u0022 says Pratt, \u0022and I feel I\u0027ll be ready to pass that test. You know, if it means not being Indiana Jones or if it means turning down a big paycheck so that I can go camping for the weekend, being difficult with my contract so that I can be let out, and it means the quality of the film goes down because I\u0027m not there to give everything, then so be it. And if it means retiring early and getting a ranch somewhere and just bird hunting, that\u0027s kind of what I secretly want to do anyways, so\u0022—he laughs—\u0022that\u0027ll be sweet.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut how much do you secretly want to do it? Because you can do it if you want to.\u000A\u000A\u0022We\u0027ll see. I don\u0027t know. I think I would do it and then three months later I would be tired of bird hunting and I would be like \u0027...Guardians Ten?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ACHRIS HEATH is a GQ correspondent.\u000A\u000A When asked by GQ to comment on this pastime, Offerman issued the following statement: \u0022Chris and I merely recognized in one another a formidable, concordant creator. Our \u0027pieces\u0027 transcend bourgeois notions like \u0027taste,\u0027 \u0027decorum,\u0027 and \u0027NSFW.\u0027 That\u0027s plebeian stuff. He is magnificent—a lavatorial Michelangelo, and I am his Da Vinci. He proffers Rubber Soul, and I reply with Pet Sounds. The notions of \u0027culture,\u0027 \u0027good taste,\u0027 \u0027decency,\u0027 and \u0027common sense\u0027 are but flotsam to us. Jetsam, even. Our works have honesty in their fiber. His letter N, I met with a lengthy riposte: a twenty-six-inch rejoinder, to be precise, unbroken. From the backstage dressing room of an eldritch Kansas City auditorium. We are Komodo dragons, Christopher and I. We are moray eels, mated for life. Look away—back to your BuzzFeed puppies and falsettos. Ours is an ursine language, of which, if you have to ask—you\u0027ll never know.\u0022",

and jolly comic sidekick who used to pull pranks and strip naked on the set of <em>Parks and Rec</em> would become Hollywood&#39;s next action superhero? For the second straight summer, he&#39;s got a giant movie riding on his shoulders—and it looks like he will for many summers to come.

He is getting in shape for three forthcoming movies and also preparing for a triathlon in a few weeks&#x2019; time, something he was talked into by a good friend, a Navy Seal whom he met while making <em>Zero Dark Thirty.</em> This is the sort of thing you might expect from the new Chris Pratt&#x2014;the one who posts six-pack selfies on Instagram, the one whose last movie, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy,</em> grossed nearly $800 million worldwide and re-invented him from a bumbling, chubby sitcom sidekick into everyone&#x2019;s favorite new movie star (a status he hopes to bolster with this month&#x2019;s <em>Jurassic World</em>). In other words, the one who has undergone a parallel physical and professional transformation without obvious precedent in Hollywood.</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1">Pratt&#x2019;s road here, to this career and this body, has been unlikely and meandering. When he first auditioned for movies in his early twenties he would try out for all kinds of roles, but he soon fell into the first of the two stereotypical parts that would fill up his next decade. &quot;Typically, I was getting typecast as the bad boyfriend. The boyfriend of the girl who you hope ends up with the guy you like. That was my bread and butter for a long time,&quot; he says. He&#x2019;s had a quick shower and has lit a cigar&#x2014;some combination of late-morning pleasure and character prep for his next movie, <em>The Magnificent Seven.</em> &quot;Looking back, I think I know why. Physically, I <em>looked</em> like an asshole.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.2"><em>What do you mean?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.3">&quot;I looked like the guy&#x2014;like Johnny in <em>The Karate Kid,</em> you know?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.5">Slowly he worked to at least make these roles funnier. &quot;I always had thought my strongest ability was improvisational comedy,&quot; he says. &quot;I was always adding stuff to scenes and the directors would be like, &#x2019;Come on, man, no, don&#x2019;t do that.&#x2019; And then that stuff would make the cut. And I was like, &#x2019;I knew it! I <em>knew</em> I was funnier than that stupid fucking director, and he didn&#x2019;t know what the fuck he was talking about! I knew it!&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.6">Soon Pratt was actually being cast for his comic instincts. And with the greater emphasis on comedy came a gradual physical transformation, one that became unavoidably apparent to him as he watched himself on-screen early in the second season of <em>Parks and Recreation.</em> &quot;I saw myself and I thought, &#x2019;Wow, I&#x2019;m getting fat.&#x2019; And then immediately I was like, &#x2019;This is the <em>funniest...</em>&#x2019; I was making myself laugh. I was: &#x2019;That&#x2019;s where it&#x2019;s at. There&#x2019;s no one doing that. No one being like a super-confident dumb fat guy.&#x2019; So I started.&quot; He told the showrunner that he wanted to get even larger, and was enthusiastically encouraged to do so. &quot;So I just got fatter,&quot; he says, &quot;and the laughs kept coming, and it was funnier and funnier. And in that moment I was like, &#x2019;Oh great, I found my niche&#x2014;this is paying better than the asshole-boyfriend parts.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.7">If you read or watch the interviews Chris Pratt did in the comedy years, he played the part of the happy plump man to perfection. But he may just have been fooling us and fooling himself at the same time. &quot;I&#x2019;m sure I was the first guy in line to buy that line of bullshit,&quot; he says now. &quot;I also understood that there was value to it&#x2014;my comedic nature understood the irony of a super-happy fat sweaty guy who is completely confident and accepting of who he was. That&#x2019;s fascinating to people. I mean, I was never as big as Chris Farley, but you look at Chris Farley&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what made him so magical. Because other people look just like him, and they&#x2019;re like, &#x2019;Why is this guy not crippled with self-doubt? Fuck, that&#x2019;s awesome. I wish I could feel that way.&#x2019; Well, I don&#x2019;t think Chris Farley did feel that way. I think he killed himself with drugs and alcohol and buried himself in an addiction to hide the fact that he didn&#x2019;t feel what he was projecting on the outside. I think that&#x2019;s often the case with comedians.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.8">In the past year or two, Pratt, who turns 36 this month, has become more candid about casting those years in a less joyful light, explaining that the highlights of his days were the eating and drinking but that the rest wasn&#x2019;t so good, that he felt physically and mentally sluggish and &quot;didn&#x2019;t feel too great about who I was.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.9">He nods when I bring this up and elaborates. &quot;My bones ached, I had cardiovascular issues, I was unhealthy, I was feeling rotten.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.a">So for instance, would you openly discuss with your wife, say: &quot;I wish my body wasn&#x2019;t like this&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t want to be like this&quot;?</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.b">&quot;Yeah. But she was so okay with it. Probably in many ways preferred me that way.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.c">Why?</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.d">&quot;I think I was outwardly having more fun. I was more fun to be around, probably. That image that I was casting, to convince people that I was okay, was a really fun person to hang around. Now I have less fun. I focus more. She doesn&#x2019;t get to cook for me the way she used to.&quot; He laughs. &quot;I was like a great pet fat guy.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.e">Does she actively complain that you&#x2019;re less fun?</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.f">&quot;No, she understands and she just supports me regardless. I think that part of her is hedging her bets that one day I&#x2019;ll be fat again, and she&#x2019;ll say, &#x2019;Remember, honey, I always told you I preferred you this way.&#x2019; She&#x2019;s probably just playing the long game.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.g"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>An aside about nudity:</strong> <em>What were you like as a young kid?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;Obnoxious.

And I was naked a lot. I was naked all the time. It was just recently, in the last few years since I&#x2019;ve become an adult, that I&#x2019;ve learned to keep my clothes on. And even then, I really haven&#x2019;t. I got yelled at by NBC for getting naked. <em>[While filming multiple takes of a</em> Parks and Recreation <em>scene in which he was supposed to shock Amy Poehler by being naked in a doorway, in one take he did it for real.]</em> I got suspended from the track team in high school for getting naked on the track bus. I was always getting naked. I thought it was hilarious. I didn&#x2019;t understand how somebody could be so offended by me just taking my junk out.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.l"><em>Did NBC explain it to you?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.m">&quot;They did&#x2014;they sent me a letter. HR sent me a letter. Someone obviously must have complained about it or something. I guess now that I don&#x2019;t work for them, I can make fun of it, but part of the letter was saying, like, &#x2019;Also, don&#x2019;t mock this. Just so we&#x2019;re clear, you&#x2019;re being reprimanded, and don&#x2019;t go around talking about how this is funny.&#x2019; [It was] the take they fucking used, by the way, that made the air, and was <em>hilarious,</em> so I was totally right, but apparently if you want to get naked there&#x2019;s certain protocols you have to take to prevent people from being offended&#x2014;you have to give them the opportunity to not see it. But that&#x2019;s how I was in high school, too. I remember walking into the coach&#x2019;s office with just a sock on. Not on my feet. And I was like, &#x2019;Hey, Coach, can I talk to you?&#x2019; And they were like, &#x2019;Jesus, God!&#x2019; &quot; He grins. &quot;I liked making people feel uncomfortable.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.n"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></strong> was the making of Pratt, but however effortless it may have seemed on-screen, the movie&#x2019;s deft combination of action and comedy, sincerity and levity, didn&#x2019;t come easily.</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.p">&quot;[<em>Guardians</em> director] James Gunn had a hard time working with me for about the first half of the movie,&quot; Pratt explains. &quot;He&#x2019;ll say&#x2014;and I wouldn&#x2019;t want to be quoted [sounding like I was] saying this about myself&#x2014;I&#x2019;m a much more cerebral person than you may expect.

So he had a hard time working with me because he&#x2019;d tell me something, or I&#x2019;d do something, and the next thing you know he couldn&#x2019;t get me back to where I started originally.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.q">&quot;I think that he had gotten a lot of success over the past few years being the funny sidekick,&quot; says Gunn, &quot;which means that he always has to juggle to entertain everybody.

A representative example is 2009&#x2019;s <em>Deep in the Valley,</em> in which Pratt&#x2019;s character and a friend find themselves magically transported to a world inhabited by porn stars continually acting out stereotypical porn-film scenarios. &quot;First time I was ever number one on the call sheet,&quot; he says. &quot;But, uh, it is not good.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.x">In the film, Pratt had a brief, lewd scene with Kim Kardashian, who played a kind of porn-world bouncer. (&quot;She&#x2019;d never really done an acting gig before,&quot; he says. &quot;She was so fucking sweet, and she was nervous.&quot;) Years later he ran into Kardashian on an airplane, but by then he was hoping she wouldn&#x2019;t notice him because now he had a new embarrassment he wished to sidestep. While filming an episode of <em>Parks and Recreation,</em> Pratt&#x2014;or his character, Andy&#x2014;had ad-libbed a joke about her that he knew would never go in the show because it was too rude. &quot;It was a very, very funny joke,&quot; he says. But it was also one he immediately thought shouldn&#x2019;t be heard in public, and so he had the foresight to request that it not be used on any future DVD gag reel.</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.y">The clip nonetheless surfaced, and Pratt says that it has become one of Andy&#x2019;s most viewed moments online. (He was told they&#x2019;d forgotten his request and he says he received an apology.) &quot;So it&#x2019;s really kind of a bummer,&quot; says Pratt. &quot;She probably doesn&#x2019;t know or doesn&#x2019;t care, I&#x2019;m sure, but I don&#x2019;t like to make jokes at other people&#x2019;s expense, if I can help it.&quot; He stops himself and reframes this rule more realistically. &quot;I like to keep my jokes about people safely way behind their backs. I&#x2019;m a shit-talker, but if I&#x2019;m gonna make a joke at someone&#x2019;s expense, I&#x2019;ll do it so that they can never hear it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.z">And so I suspect he&#x2019;d prefer the joke to remain unrepeated here.

It&#x2019;s when we are talking about <em>Delivery Man,</em> the 2013 Vince Vaughn movie in which Pratt bulked up to 295 pounds for a supporting role as a failed lawyer, that he unveils the first of these.</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.17">&quot;I came up with some awesome techniques on that movie that I still use,&quot; he declares. &quot;Some awesome techniques for acting that I think I might have invented.&quot; Techniques, he explains, that are based on how the different wavelengths of color can affect you. &quot;In that movie, I used bright orange, like a blaze orange, as a reminder that my [character&#x2019;s] mother doesn&#x2019;t believe in me and that she believes I&#x2019;m a failure,&quot; he explains. On the set, he would then sequester orange Post-it notes out of camera shot. &quot;Then,&quot; he says, &quot;it would catch my attention halfway through the scene, and it would affect me emotionally underneath.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.18">Pratt also uses music in his acting, which in itself is not so unusual, though perhaps not many actors store 110 pieces of music in their phones under the title &quot;Acting Music,&quot; subdivided into five categories: &quot;Love,&quot; &quot;Sadness,&quot; &quot;Wonderment,&quot; &quot;Action,&quot; and the vaguely mysterious &quot;Volume Five.&quot; (Volume Five turns out to be &quot;a collection of kind of all of them.&quot;) Pratt then rechristens each separate piece of music&#x2014;typically an instrumental from a past movie soundtrack&#x2014;with its own new name to describe the emotion it encapsulates, so that within &quot;Sadness,&quot; for instance, you can find &quot;Ethereal Reaction,&quot; &quot;The Long Walk,&quot; &quot;European Town in Ruins,&quot; &quot;Wonder of Life,&quot; &quot;Leaving Home,&quot; and &quot;Brother&#x2019;s Funeral.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.19">The way Pratt sees acting, the &quot;three legs of the acting table&quot; are your body, your voice, and &quot;the rhythm of your spirit&quot;; he finds this music collection particularly useful with the third of these. &quot;It&#x2019;s hard to manipulate the rhythm of your spirit,&quot; he points out. &quot;That&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ve been thinking a lot about. Like, I had road rage just yesterday....&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1a">And here Chris Pratt launches into a story about yesterday&#x2019;s road rage. He tells this story as a way of explaining how real-life experiences yield information that he can use as an actor, but you might also learn other things from it&#x2014;for instance, about how fiercely, and not so far beneath Pratt&#x2019;s abundant charm and warmth, anger is bubbling away.</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1b">The story is about how he was cut off on the freeway, and his realization, in the midst of his fury, that this was a prime opportunity for Chris Pratt the actor to learn something about how real anger is expressed. He explains how he told himself not to hold back: &quot; &#x2019;Just get mad. Just get fucking pissed at this cunt who just cut you off. This fucking bitch.&#x2019; I was so mad. It cost me twenty minutes, because she wouldn&#x2019;t let me get over, and then I&#x2019;m fucking on some other freeway going the wrong way. I&#x2019;m running late. I was so pissed. And part of me was, &#x2019;Okay, great, this is great research&#x2014;what do you look and sound like right now?&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1c">When I ask a bit more about the traffic incident that triggered all of this, though, Pratt first echoes his original story (&quot;She cut me off, fucking bitch&#x2014;I was mad as hell&quot;), but then his account takes an unexpected turn: &quot;No, I&#x2019;m sure she didn&#x2019;t. It was probably my fault for not paying attention. I&#x2019;ve got a terrible sense of direction. My mind is constantly wandering, and I get lost all the time. I go to the same diner for fifteen years, I&#x2019;m driving my wife there, and she&#x2019;s like, &#x2019;Honey, I think you might want to take this right here.&#x2019; I&#x2019;ll end up in fucking Downtown. I do this all the time. It&#x2019;s kind of a bad habit.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1d">For <em>Jurassic World,</em> he used another new acting technique, one he stumbled onto online. It&#x2019;s a technique where you think about which animal your character would be, and then use that information to determine which part of the body your character leads with when he moves. For this film, Pratt determined that the appropriate animal would be a dolphin. &quot;They lead with their foreheads,&quot; he explains.</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1e">On <em>Jurassic World,</em> all of Pratt&#x2019;s ideas and approaches were combined into a kind of mantra that he would repeat to himself just before the camera rolled: &quot;Flow core, no TC, volume up point five, Eric Church.&quot; Eric Church to remind him of &quot;Dark Side,&quot; a song by Church that Pratt was listening to over and over, and the darkness in this character it encapsulated. &quot;Flow core&quot; to remind him of his posture when he was paddleboarding. &quot;Volume up point five&quot; to remind him to make his voice slightly louder. &quot;No TC&quot; to remind him to lead with his forehead, in a formulation only a formerly fat man would think to use: <em>No triple chin</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1f">I tell Pratt I have a hunch that very few movie stars Google for acting tips.</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1g">&quot;Maybe they won&#x2019;t talk about it,&quot; he says. &quot;Maybe that&#x2019;s my next lesson&#x2014;just stop talking about it and be like, &#x2019;Oh, I don&#x2019;t know what it is.... It&#x2019;s just a gift, I guess.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1h">He concedes that not all his directors encourage his search for new tricks. James Gunn, he says, tells him, &quot;You always have a new thing you&#x2019;re doing&#x2014;just stop.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1i">Gunn demurs at the &quot;stop&quot; part but says, &quot;Chris is a man of insights, and he&#x2019;s always having these big insights&#x2014;he&#x2019;s got a new idea every day about everything.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1j"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1k"><strong>For most of their</strong> time together, Faris has been the more famous one (a renown that reached its peak with <em>The House Bunny</em>), and I ask Pratt whether it&#x2019;s weird in a marriage like this how the fame balance keeps readjusting itself.</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1l">&quot;Mmm,&quot; he considers, &quot;I think it probably could affect... I think it&#x2019;s something you have to manage. It&#x2019;s a little different, because she&#x2019;s achieved enough to hang her hat on for her life, anyways. She&#x2019;s done really amazing things&#x2014;she&#x2019;s always gonna be known for really funny and great work, critically acclaimed work and successful stuff.&quot; But he certainly remembers what it was like to be the less feted member of a Hollywood couple. &quot;I&#x2019;ve had those moments,&quot; he says, &quot;where I was like the guy holding the purse at events and people just looked right through me. And, you know, actors come up and just blatantly hit on my wife in front of me and don&#x2019;t even look at me. I&#x2019;m like, &#x2019;What the fuck, dude?&#x2019; I can think of exactly who they are, too, and I hope they fucking audition for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy.</em>&quot; (A sequel, the first of at least two that Pratt says are already planned, begins filming next February.) There are others whose transgressions he hasn&#x2019;t forgotten: &quot;Also, producers and studio people now who will come up to me and treat me the same way that they were treating Anna. They&#x2019;re like, &#x2019;I always knew...&#x2019; I&#x2019;m like, &#x2019;Is that right? That&#x2019;s interesting, because you fucking stared right through me the last time....&#x2019; &quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1m"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1n"><strong>An aside about poop photos:</strong> <em>You and Nick Offerman really send each other photos of each other&#x2019;s poop?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1o">Pratt laughs. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1p"><em>Still?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.1q">&quot;Not like every poop, but if it&#x2019;s special enough.

He met with James Gunn this week to be briefed on the <em>Guardians</em> sequel for the first time. &quot;I got teary-eyed,&quot; he says. &quot;He&#x2019;s so fucking smart and peculiar.&quot; (Gunn declined to share the whole plot, Pratt says: &quot;He just knows me too well to tell me too much.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.21">In turn, Gunn tells me this: &quot;I said before we ever started shooting <em>Guardians</em> that Chris Pratt&#x2019;s the biggest movie star in the world, it&#x2019;s just that people don&#x2019;t know it yet. And that&#x2019;s the case.&quot; As more people begin to share this opinion, one consequence is the way Pratt is routinely reported to be involved in multiple other new projects, often with a conviction that is confusing to him, given how wrong these reports typically are.</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.22">For instance, there is the widely and confidently reported story that he will be the next Indiana Jones. Pratt was on a four-day hunt on a Texas ranch when his manager and agent called to say that this &quot;fact&quot; had exploded all over the Internet. &quot;And so I came home, and then there was paparazzi asking me about it and people asking me to sign Indiana Jones pictures and Indiana Jones hats,&quot; he says. The truth, as far as he is concerned, is that someone high up at Disney did mention to him a while back that they were picking up the rights to <em>Indiana Jones,</em> to which Pratt commented that his action-adventure card was fairly full. (If <em>Jurassic World</em> does well, there will be sequels. And for the record, this is how he describes, almost more to himself than to me, his future <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> obligations: &quot;...I&#x2019;m tied to doing three more, or five more, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> or whatever it is, you know, two more <em>Guardians</em> plus another couple...&quot; I think this means he is committed to at least two sequels, as well as spin-off projects where his character will appear with other Marvel characters.) But as it happens, he&#x2019;s also been around Steven Spielberg a fair bit recently (Spielberg produced <em>Jurassic World</em>), both before and after this rumor broke. &quot;I just didn&#x2019;t bring it up and he didn&#x2019;t bring it up,&quot; he says, &quot;so I don&#x2019;t know.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.23">Similarly, it&#x2019;s also been rumored recently that he will appear in a Channing Tatum-produced <em>Ghostbusters</em> remake. Even less likely. &quot;No one has ever even spoken to me about that,&quot; he says. &quot;Never. I&#x2019;ve even seen Channing a couple times. As far as I know, that&#x2019;s complete bullshit.&quot; He ticks off others. &quot;<em>Knight Rider</em>&#x2014;bullshit. All of them.&quot; As we talk, a photo comes through on his phone. His son. &quot;My son went to the dentist for the first time today,&quot; he says. &quot;Oh, my God, he&#x2019;s smiling. Oh, sweet boy!&quot; Pratt tells me that he and Faris would like more kids. &quot;I had siblings, so did Anna&#x2014;we both dream of it. Jack should have the gift of a little person to push around, whether we have kids or potentially have a surrogate or adopt kids. He was premature, and Anna&#x2019;s 38, so the idea of going through that again&#x2014;that was tough, and I think, like, that&#x2019;s something to truly consider.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.24">Either way, he clearly thinks of Jack as a kind of reality check. &quot;I have a feeling I&#x2019;ll be tested and I&#x2019;ll have to prove to him that he&#x2019;s more important to me than show business,&quot; says Pratt, &quot;and I feel I&#x2019;ll be ready to pass that test. You know, if it means not being Indiana Jones or if it means turning down a big paycheck so that I can go camping for the weekend, being difficult with my contract so that I can be let out, and it means the quality of the film goes down because I&#x2019;m not there to give everything, then so be it. And if it means retiring early and getting a ranch somewhere and just bird hunting, that&#x2019;s kind of what I secretly want to do anyways, so&quot;&#x2014;he laughs&#x2014;&quot;that&#x2019;ll be sweet.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1qy7x79mj9c.1.1.0.0.4.25"><em>But how much do you secretly want to do it?
