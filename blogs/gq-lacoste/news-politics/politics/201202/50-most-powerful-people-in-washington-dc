Eric Cantor</strong>

<p> <em>Virginia Representative, House Majority Leader</em></p>

<p> The Republican whom Democrats—especially Obama—hate most. The Virginia Congressman masterminded, and then masterfully carried out, the GOP&#39;s strategy of legislative intransigence that has stymied the White House these past three years. In the process, he imposed his will on all of Washington, refashioning the city into a hyperpartisan capital of gridlock. And if Obama&#39;s a one-term president, it will be Cantor—as much as Newt or Mitt—who&#39;ll deserve the credit/blame for knocking him out. &quot;We have people who have great ideas but who can&#39;t ecute and we have people who know how to act but aren&#39;t steeped in policy,&quot; says Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan. &quot;Eric has both of those talents, which is rare.&quot; Widely presumed to be the next GOP Speaker of the House, the biggest question for Cantor is does he wait for John Boehner (#12) to step aside, or does he give him a shove?</p></div><span data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.0.2.0.0.0.5.0.3.1"></span></div></div></div></main></div><div class="col col-md-6" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.0.2.0.1"><aside class="slideshow-aside" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0"><div class="component-counter" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter"><div class="counter" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0"><span class="current" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.0">1</span><span class="divider" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.1">of</span><span class="total" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.2">51</span></div></div><span class="component-toggle toggle-thumbnails" aria-label="Toggle Button" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.3">Toggle Thumbnails</span><div class="gqGalleryBox displayAd displayAd300x250 displayAd300x250Js gallery-aside-ad not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBox300x250_frame" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.4:0"></div></aside></div></div></div></div><div class="gallery-bottom-container" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.1"><div class="col col-md-14 gallery-bottom-pane" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.1.0"><div class="gqGalleryBan displayAd displayAd728x90 displayAd728x90Js gq-gallery-banner not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBan728x90_frame" data-reactid=".idl3ikpx4w.1:3.0.1.0.0"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
