  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHere is a mountain of corned-beef sandwiches, each crammed with meat. Eleven men and one woman—some of the world\u0027s top competitive eaters—intently scrutinize the sandwiches as they\u0027re wheeled by on a trolley toward the stage. We\u0027re at an outdoor shopping mall in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, the site of the third annual TooJay\u0027s World Class Corned Beef Eating Championship. One contestant drove a thousand miles to be here. He got a flat tire and had to double back to Avis in the middle of the night, but he\u0027s made it, and he\u0027s ready to battle. I\u0027m intrigued and mystified by the dedication of these athletes, as some of them call themselves. Who are they? What motivates them? I notice them glancing at one another in complicated, intense ways.\u000A\u000ABut a sense of fatalistic doom pervades the air. This is because one man is quite simply predestined to win. His name is Joey Chestnut, and he\u0027s a charismatic, sweet-natured 28-year-old Californian in surprisingly good shape for someone who bulldozes hideous amounts of food into his stomach on a regular basis. In the past six years, Joey has completely dominated the \u0022sport\u0022 of competitive eating as it has expanded from a once-a-year carnival stunt to a worldwide tour. He holds world records for hot dogs, asparagus, funnel cake, jalapeño poppers, gyros, grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken wings, cheesesteaks, shrimp wontons, tacos, and at least a dozen other \u0022disciplines.\u0022\u000A\u000AAbout 200 people have turned up to watch him try to break his own corned-beef-sandwich record. Fans surround Joey for his autograph. One of them sidles over to me. His name is Sam Barclay. He\u0027s such a devotee, he says, that he\u0027s actually got himself a job with the International Federation of Competitive Eating (IFOCE), the sport\u0027s governing body, as a helper and part-time emcee. And he is in total awe of Joey.\u000A\u000A\u0022Everyone, since the dawn of time, has eaten or they\u0027ve perished,\u0022 Sam says. \u0022But that man is the best eater who has ever lived, in the history of the world.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe fans are mostly ignoring Joey\u0027s challengers. There\u0027s the world number two, Pat \u0022Deep Dish\u0022 Bertoletti, muscular, wiry, a Mohawk haircut, almost always the bridesmaid, rarely the bride. There\u0027s a beautiful woman in her twenties named Maria Edible—a cupcake and a burger tattooed on her arm and the word EDIBLE tattooed inside her mouth. There\u0027s a bear of a guy named Bob Shoudt—about the only family man on the circuit. He has three kids and puts any prize money he makes into their college funds. I notice another challenger—a waif of a boy with long dark hair—staring fidly at Joey from across the crowd.\u000A\u000AI approach Joey. \u0022Who\u0027s that boy?\u0022 I whisper.\u000A\u000A\u0022Matt Stonie,\u0022 he whispers back. \u0022He\u0027s new. He\u0027s good. I watched a YouTube video of him in training. You hear his mother in the background encouraging him. When I saw that, I thought, \u0027Why would she be encouraging him? There must be something wrong with him for her to be encouraging him to eat.\u0027 \u0022 Joey lowers his voice. \u0022Apparently when he was 15 he was anorexic.\u0022\u000A\u000AI take this in. \u0022Wow,\u0022 I say. \u0022I\u0027m not so sure competitive eating is such a good idea for him.\u0022\u000A\u000AJoey nods. \u0022You\u0027d think someone with anorexia wouldn\u0027t like food,\u0022 he says. \u0022It\u0027s weird. He\u0027s a good eater. But I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll ever be an awesome eater, because surely he doesn\u0027t love to eat. I love to eat.\u0022 He smiles slightly. \u0022I analyze them all. I\u0027ve got to always find a reason why they\u0027ll never beat me. So I\u0027m telling myself that if he doesn\u0027t have that love, I\u0027ll always be better than Matt Stonie.\u0022\u000A\u000AOur conversation is interrupted by the emcee, Rich Shea, who is telling the audience how blessed we Americans are to have the freedom to eat as many corned-beef sandwiches as we like under a big blue sky. He introduces the contestants. Each takes his place on the stage. Joey is, of course, last: \u0022...the bratwurst- and pork-rib-eating champion of the world, the calzone champion of the world, the Nathan\u0027s Famous hot-dog-eating CHAMPION OF THE WORLD! JOEY CHESTNUT!\u0022\u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMatt Stonie, the new kid\u000A\u000AFor two days now, I\u0027ve been listening to Joey extol the sport as a sensei would a martial art. He has told me, for example, how he has studied the ingestion techniques of snakes: \u0022Their muscles are contracting constantly. You\u0027ll see when I\u0027m eating, there\u0027s a constant weird up-and-down motion. I\u0027m using my whole rib cage to compact the food.\u0022\u000A\u000AThen there are the years he\u0027s spent determining how long to fast before each contest (three days) and which oils best lubricate the digestive system. He\u0027s settled on an exact combination of specific brands of olive and fish oils, but he won\u0027t divulge more. \u0022I had to figure it out,\u0022 he said, \u0022so why should I let it be known?\u0022\u000A\u000ASo after all of Joey\u0027s talk of science and preparation, I was imagining the corned-beef contest to be somehow more graceful and balletic. But as Shea counts down to zero and the eating begins, what I see instead are twelve people grotesquely cramming huge piles of meat and fat-sodden rye bread into their mouths. The juice drips down their arms, saturating their shirts. Their puffed-out cheeks are beetroot red. They resemble sweaty, meat-smeared squirrels. The sickly smell of fat permeates the hot air. I notice that the fastest eaters are squeezing the sandwiches in their clenched fists before swallowing them. With one hand they\u0027re shoveling in the food, with the other they\u0027re gulping liters of water or, in the case of Pat Bertoletti, bright red cherry limeade. Coupled with the semi-masticated sandwiches that   are spraying from their mouths in globules as they slobber onto themselves and the table, the whole thing looks like an unimaginable crime scene.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a ten-minute contest. By minute six, most of the field is belching and cramping. But not Joey Chestnut. Pat Bertoletti is doing his level best to keep pace with the champ, and young Matt Stonie seems remarkably adept for someone so slight. But Joey is on another level. He\u0027s Usain Bolt, but with sandwiches. He had been telling the truth about the \u0022weird up-and-down motion\u0022 in his rib cage. He looks like he\u0027s performing a disquieting contemporary dance routine. \u0022In competitive eating there\u0027s a natural slowdown,\u0022 Sam Barclay tells me. \u0022But Joey? Nonstop.\u0022\u000A\u000AWe are witnessing a new world record! Joey devours twenty corned-beef sandwiches, shattering his previous record by five and a half. Barclay shakes his head in wonder. \u0022It\u0027s not pretty,\u0022 he concedes. \u0022But it is beautiful.\u0022\u000A\u000AJoey collects his $5,000 prize money, poses for the cameras, and disappears behind the stage, where I find him looking terrible. \u0022I\u0027ve got heatstroke,\u0022 he murmurs.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s lucky you\u0027re not flying home until tomorrow,\u0022 I say. He\u0027d told me earlier that he always gives himself a day before flying, because it would be a nightmare if the seat-belt sign were to go on just as the inevitable evacuation began to occur.\u000A\u000A\u0022Describe how you\u0027re feeling with twenty corned-beef sandwiches inside you,\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m used to it,\u0022 he says. \u0022But...pain...\u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s speaking in fractured sentences, with great difficulty. It seems cruel for me to continue the interview. I congratulate him once again.\u000A\u000A\u0022Hopefully I\u0027ll feel okay,\u0022 he says, \u0022in four or five hours.\u0022\u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ACompetitive eating is, of course, a manifestation of the American urge to turn absolutely everything, even something as elemental as eating, into a competition. And it is as old   as America itself—or maybe it started in the early \u002770s.\u000A\u000AThe fact is, it\u0027s tough to suss out the history of the sport through the thick-as-mustard layer of PR myth that has been slathered onto it by generations of pitchmen. There are tales (possibly true) of pioneers staging contests in the early days of the republic to celebrate bountiful harvests. Nathan\u0027s Famous, the Coney Island hot-dog vendor whose annual Fourth of July extravaganza remains the Super Bowl of the sport, claims its event goes back to 1916, when a group of immigrants put on a contest to test their patriotic mettle. This is (almost certainly) untrue. The first Nathan\u0027s contest, as best anyone can remember, was actually held on July 4, 1972.\u000A\u000AAnd for the next twenty-five years, that\u0027s about all competitive eating amounted to—the Nathan\u0027s contest and a smattering of much smaller events across the land. To expand, the sport needed its own Vince McMahon, an entrepreneur showman with a vision. In 1997 it found two: brothers Rich and George Shea. George had done PR for Nathan\u0027s and saw opportunity in expanding the tour and soliciting sponsors. The Sheas created the IFOCE, and over the next few years, everything ambled along without much fanfare. Until, that is, July 4, 2001—the most extraordinary day in the history of   competitive eating.\u000A\u000AWatching the news footage filmed that day, during the minutes before everything changed forever, I was struck by how lackadaisical things seemed. It was a   hot Coney Island morning. The competitors, milling behind the Nathan\u0027s stage, looked overweight and carefree, nothing like the focused gym rats of today. One mentioned to a TV reporter that he\u0027d just had a nice big breakfast.\u000A\u000A\u0022Why?\u0022 she asked, surprised.\u000A\u000AHe shrugged. \u0022Why not?\u0022\u000A\u000AShe didn\u0027t bother interviewing the skinny Japanese kid nobody recognized. But then the contest began. And by the time the Americans had consumed about eight hot dogs each, the quiet newcomer from Nagano had demolished a staggering thirty. Until that day, the Nathan\u0027s Famous record was twenty-five and one eighth dogs in twelve minutes. Takeru Kobayashi ate fifty.\u000A\u000AHe became an international media sensation, the subject of thousands of gleeful headlines. CNN put him on a list of \u0022Japan\u0027s greatest sports heroes.\u0022 And he remained unbeaten—and virtually synonymous with competitive eating—for six years. But then a new and even greater virtuoso emerged.\u000A\u000AJoey \u0022Jaws\u0022 Chestnut grew up in Vallejo, California. Being the third of four boys, he was always searching for something he could beat his older brothers at. And that thing seemed to be eating very fast. He showed such a talent for it that in 2005, his youngest brother entered him into a lobster competition in Reno.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027d never eaten lobster before,\u0022 Joey told me. \u0022I was 21. I didn\u0027t know what the heck I was doing. I was scooping guts. But I tied for third. And the two men who beat me didn\u0027t look good. One was Bob Shoudt. He seemed in pain. And I felt fine! I was \u0027Oh, my God, they look like they\u0027re dying. And I can eat so much more!\u0027 I knew I was made for it after that contest.\u0022\u000A\u000AJoey decided that night to dedicate his life to the pursuit. He became obsessed—\u0022nervous, always nervous\u0022—and his discipline paid off in Coney Island on July 4, 2007, when he scarfed down sixty-six hot dogs before an audience of 40,000, besting Kobayashi by a three-dog margin. Joey defended his title the next year and every year since. At the 2009 Nathan\u0027s contest, he set a new world record with sixty-eight hot dogs. Last year, between his prize money and sponsorships, he raked in $205,000.\u000A\u000AKobayashi, meanwhile, hasn\u0027t competed in an IFOCE-sanctioned contest since 2009, the year he finished second to Joey at Nathan\u0027s for the third time in a row. (\u0022Kobayashi won\u0027t talk to me,\u0022 Joey says. \u0022He hates me.\u0022) I assume this is due to his shame over becoming second best, but when I reach him on the phone, he denies this. Through an interpreter, he tells me that the Sheas \u0022love to say, \u0027Kobi isn\u0027t man enough to eat up against our dude Chestnut.\u0027 But it has never been that. They wanted me to sign a contract that gave away all my human rights!\u0022 The IFOCE contract, he says, forbade him from competing in any non-Shea contests, which he took as a declaration of war. Nowadays, Kobayashi is still a draw, but he exists in a parallel universe of events that seem more about appearance fees and PR than official competition.\u000A\u000AWhen a sport starts spawning feuds and sideshows, that\u0027s when you know it\u0027s turning into something truly large.\u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAt the corned-beef contest, no one was surprised that Pat Bertoletti came in second, with eighteen and a half sandwiches. He and Joey were neck and neck until the final moments, when Pat, a 26-year-old caterer from Chicago, floundered and Joey seemed to accelerate. It was who came in third (with fourteen and a half sandwiches) that shocked everyone—and announced the arrival of a rising star. The bronze went to the waifish mystery kid, Matt Stonie.\u000A\u000AI found him after the contest, sitting in the shade. Unlike Joey, he looked fine. We got to talking about his life. He\u0027s 19. Back in middle school, he said, \u0022I was an A student, but then I went down to B\u0027s and C\u0027s. My parents freaked out and sent me to boarding school. I hated it. It was really strict. I kept myself isolated. I got kind of confused about who I am.\u0022 He paused. \u0022I\u0027ve always loved food. But I began to have a hard time telling myself what was correct. I remember thinking, If I lose five pounds now, I can go home this weekend and have a good time with my friends, eating burgers....\u0022\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s how the anorexia started. It wasn\u0027t long before he weighed eighty-five pounds. His life became all about doctors and psychiatrists. Finally he decided to reclaim some control. \u0022So I utilized competitive eating to try to take care of myself in general.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Have any doctors suggested that competitive eating may not be the best way to get over an eating disorder?\u0022 I asked.\u000A\u000A\u0022My doctor loves it,\u0022 Matt said. \u0022I\u0027m super healthy. I\u0027ve got normal cholesterol levels. I\u0027m weighing anywhere between 120 and 130 pounds. It\u0027s a disorder that sticks with you, so it\u0027s a process I\u0027m still working on. But I\u0027m hitting the gym a lot more. I\u0027m trying to build up. Even though it\u0027s nice to be skinny, having a little more mass on you makes it a lot easier to deal with the contests.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Joey told me he thinks he\u0027ll always have the psychological advantage over you, because your anorexia will make you hesitate. And in that hesitation he\u0027ll triumph,\u0022 I said.\u000A\u000A\u0022Joey talked about me?\u0022 Matt said. He looked thrilled. \u0022I guess I\u0027ll tell him what I\u0027ve had to say to a lot of people.\u0022 He addressed my voice recorder: \u0022Joey, I\u0027ll prove you wrong.\u0022\u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000APat Bertolletti, number two in the world\u000A\u000AA cloak-and-dagger meeting at a Dunkin\u0027 Donuts in Clifton, New Jersey. Maria Edible arrives at 9 p.m., looking furtive. She\u0027s the beautiful woman with the food tattoos.\u000A\u000ABack in Florida, she told me about her strange \u0022double life.\u0022 Her parents, with whom she lives, were unaware of her competitive eating. \u0022It\u0027s quite challenging,\u0022 she said. \u0022I train in my room. So I\u0027m literally sneaking past my dad\u0027s office with my tray of corned-beef sandwiches.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022What about the smell?\u0022 I asked her.\u000A\u000A\u0022The room airs out by the time they wake up in the morning,\u0022 she said.\u000A\u000AI offer her a doughnut, but she declines. She\u0027s fasting for the upcoming Isle Waterloo World Cupcake Eating Championship, which is two days away in Iowa. She shows me photos of her \u0022training area\u0022—her tiny bedroom. Thirty-six cupcakes are piled   up on the dresser. She\u0027s 27, a shy person, she says. By day she works in a \u0022corporate environment\u0022 in New York City. She   won\u0027t say where.\u000A\u000AA couple of nights ago her parents found her TooJay\u0027s competition T-shirt, which led to some feverish Googling. And they discovered that she actually leads a triple life.   She\u0027s not just a competitive eater but also a lingerie/pinup model who sometimes incorporates food into her shoots. Soon they found topless photographs of their daughter on her hands and knees, alluringly clutching a hot dog. Another topless shot had her on her back, covered in chili and tortilla chips. \u0022My mom was, \u0027This is a disorder.\u0027 My dad was, \u0027This is so bad, you\u0027re going to die early. I want you to see a doctor.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AAs it happens, binge eating is not currently considered a mental disorder. But that\u0027s probably about to change. In May 2013, the American Psychiatric Association will publish the fifth edition of its manual, the DSM, and binge eating is expected to be included.\u000A\u000A\u0022Do you think it\u0027s a disorder?\u0022 I ask Maria.\u000A\u000A\u0022I wouldn\u0027t call it that,\u0022 she says. \u0022But I\u0027d always turn to food when I was stressed. And I\u0027d feel bad sitting at home stuffing my face.\u0022\u000A\u000AShe says her parents are more worried about her than ever, but she\u0027s actually never felt happier. \u0022There\u0027s the whole being-on-stage thing—I can feel like a star. And now if I stuff my face, people give me money and attention. So that feels better. Plus, there\u0027s the travel, the people I meet. We\u0027re like a family.\u0022\u000A\u000AShe says she\u0027s tried explaining to her parents that \u0022for the first time in my life I\u0027ve found something I\u0027m committed to, but they don\u0027t want to know.\u0022\u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMaura Edible (um, not her real name)\u000A\u000AI wanted to know about Bob Shoudt, the man who beat Joey at the lobster contest in Reno, so I e-mailed IFOCE co-founder Rich Shea. Rich replied with something strange: \u0022Bob is the one guy I have never been able to figure out, ever.\u0022 He didn\u0027t elaborate.\u000A\u000ABob, who\u0027s currently ranked fifth in the world, lives in the Philadelphia area and does IT work for Hewlett-Packard clients. I meet him at the offices of one of them, and we go to Applebee\u0027s for lunch. But he doesn\u0027t eat. Like Maria, he\u0027s fasting in preparation for the cupcakes. He\u0027s not a lunch person anyway, he says. In fact, he first noticed he was an exceptional eater when he began skipping breakfasts and lunches. He figured that if he missed breakfast, he could sleep for twenty minutes longer, and if he worked through lunch, he could get home sooner. \u0022So at dinner I eat a lot of food,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AI scrutinize Bob as I eat. He seems to have something about him that Joey and Maria and Matt lack. Then I work out   what it is. He seems content.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ve got the house, the car, the picket fence,\u0022 Bob says. \u0022I\u0027m living my dream life. So the competitive eating on weekends is great, but it\u0027s not my life.\u0022\u000A\u000AJoey said as much about Bob. \u0022He\u0027s the weekend-warrior type,\u0022 he told me. I could tell Joey found this approach to be a weakness. To be a titan, you need twenty-four-seven commitment.\u000A\u000A\u0022Joey thinks your happiness is the reason you rarely win,\u0022 I tell Bob.\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, he knows it,\u0022 Bob says. \u0022I was talking to him Tuesday night. He said, \u0027Why aren\u0027t you training for the cupcakes?\u0027 I said, \u0027Joey, I got to pick up my daughter, drive her to dance class, drive my other daughter to basketball...\u0027 \u0022 A faraway look crosses Bob\u0027s face. \u0022But when I\u0027m at the table...I can\u0027t let on in an interview how seriously I take it, because I\u0027d probably be committed to a mental hospital.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022What do you mean?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A\u0022Time slows down,\u0022 he says. \u0022You don\u0027t hear the announcer. You just have this...flow.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022When were you last in that altered state?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A\u0022Probably when I did ninety-five hamburgers [sliders] in eight minutes,\u0022 Bob says. \u0022I was just totally locked down.\u0022 He pauses. \u0022I know it\u0027s viewed as horror, shock, a sideshow. But when people see us up there, it blows them away. Which is why the groupies are insane.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Groupies?!\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m thoroughly happily married, so I\u0027m on the sidelines,\u0022 says Bob. \u0022But I\u0027ve seen stuff. Doors open.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027d imagine it would be a turnoff,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A\u0022Me, too.\u0022 Bob shrugs. \u0022But no.\u0022\u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000AWe\u0027re in Waterloo, Iowa, at the Isle Casino Hotel, a bleak resort plopped into a mass of gray nothingness—miles of farmland. First prize for the cupcakes contest is just $1,500. The stage has been ignominiously set up in the shadows under the lobby escalators, far from the slot machines, which is the only bustling part of the building. And by bustling, I mean a handful of elderly people robotically pressing the spin buttons as if toiling on a production line. I can\u0027t imagine how even a competitive-eating contest will lure them from the slots.\u000A\u000AThe world\u0027s number two and three—Pat Bertoletti and Tim \u0022Eater X\u0022 Janus—are somewhere in the building, but Joey is not. He has skipped this event, believing it to be shoddily organized. Matt Stonie is absent, too. Casino contests are 21 and over, so Matt has to wait two years before he\u0027s allowed to compete.\u000A\u000AI stand with Bob Shoudt in the lobby. He seems happy, energetic, I suppose because, with Joey not here, he has a chance to win.\u000A\u000ABob tells me he\u0027d love the opportunity to have an illicit look at a cupcake.\u000A\u000A\u0022Would you eat it?\u0022 I ask him.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027d probably just put it in my mouth and spit it out,\u0022 he says. \u0022Will it be dense? Dry?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Wouldn\u0027t that give you an unfair advantage?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000ABob looks at me. And then something happens. Perhaps this forlorn casino has made him feel forlorn about the sport he loves so much. But it all pours out. Competitive eating, he says, is rife with unfair advantages.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ve seen everything,\u0022 he says. \u0022People throwing hot dogs under the table. People making the biggest messes you can imagine.\u0022\u000A\u000AMy eyes widen. \u0022So there\u0027s such a mess under the table it\u0027s impossible to determine what counts as an eaten thing?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, there\u0027s techniques,\u0022 says Bob. \u0022People suddenly get happy feet.\u0022 He mimes an eater dropping an item of food and then covertly stamping it into the ground. I\u0027m appalled. Cheating makes everything pointless. And then Bob confesses that—if need be—he will be one of those cheaters. When his wife is in the crowd, they use pre-arranged signals. \u0022If the eaters are dropping stuff like crazy, she\u0027ll give a meaningless cheer. I\u0027ll understand. Suddenly the food gets very slippery for me.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A_Competitive eating: It\u0027s not just for hot dogs anymore.\u000A\u000APictured: Corned-beef sandwiches_\u000A\u000AHe gives me a look that says: Don\u0027t judge me until you\u0027ve walked in my shoes. Leave the Gandhi-like behavior to the fools who don\u0027t mind losing to the cheaters.\u000A\u000ASuddenly something over my shoulder catches Bob\u0027s eye. \u0022The cupcakes!\u0022 he exclaims.\u000A\u000AA man is wheeling some silver cabinets toward the eating table. We hurry over. \u0022Is it possible to look at a cupcake?\u0022 Bob asks the man.\u000A\u000A\u0022Sure,\u0022 he says. Bob takes one and instantly scurries to the toilets. He\u0027s gone so fast I don\u0027t have time to follow.\u000A\u000AThe contestants drift in. Maria keeps to herself in the shadows. I\u0027ve calculated that each cupcake contains around 500 calories, which means the contestants will be eating something like 25,000 calories in eight minutes. It would take a normal person eating a normal amount of calories ten days to consume that many. I find this horrifying, but no one else seems to care. Also horrifying: There are buckets under the stage. Today\u0027s emcee, Dave Keating, explains they\u0027re for \u0022reversals. We don\u0027t use the V-word on the circuit.\u0022 A reversal, by the way, results in immediate disqualification.\u000A\u000AA few dozen gamblers amble into the lobby, joining the small crowd of fans and family members who\u0027ve made the journey. And then there\u0027s the countdown, and the contest begins.\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t know if it\u0027s the absence of Joey that\u0027s spurring the eaters so frenziedly on, or whether the sugar rush is giving them a kind of frantic energy, but within a few minutes their eyes are bulging, their bodies are shaking, and there\u0027s no slowdown. Each cupcake only seems to fire them up for more. And suddenly it is pandemonium. Something happens that (I\u0027m later told) has happened only once before in the history of competitive eating.\u000A\u000A\u0022We\u0027re OUT OF CUPCAKES!\u0022 yells Dave the emcee. \u0022It\u0027s first to finish! First to finish, ladies and gentlemen!\u0022 Nobody seems to know what this means, but Dave keeps yelling it: \u0022First to finish! I\u0027ve never seen anything like this! This is an absolutely new record, ladies and gentlemen!\u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s putting on a brave face, trying to make the debacle seem exciting, but it isn\u0027t. It\u0027s confusing. Some competitors, like Bob and Pat, have no cupcakes left, so they\u0027re just standing there. Others, like Maria, are still eating. Bob starts yelling at Dave. I leap onto the stage, my voice recorder in my hand, to chronicle the chaos. Some casino staff members run across the lobby to intercept me. \u0022Sir!\u0022 they\u0027re yelling. \u0022Sir! Sir! Competitors only on the stage!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022But I\u0027m from GQ!\u0022 I yell back. \u0022I\u0027m ACCESS ALL AREAS!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Get to the side!\u0022 the security guard is hollering at me. \u0022TO THE SIDE.\u0022\u000A\u000AMaria is standing there, a cupcake in her hand, staring limply into space. This commotion doesn\u0027t really involve her, nobody\u0027s looking at her, and she looks lost.\u000A\u000ABob is still shouting. Dave continues in vain to make it sound historic. \u0022Six hundred and sixty cupcakes eaten in six minutes! It\u0027s a brand-new record!\u0022\u000A\u000AThings finally calm down after ten minutes or so, and I wander over to Dave. \u0022What a calamity,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A\u0022It really sucked,\u0022 he says. \u0022And of course we have a fucking reporter here.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022What went wrong?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A\u0022The cupcakes were lighter than last year,\u0022 he says. \u0022We had a wider field. It was a perfect storm.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe top five competitors agree to split the prize money, with a little extra going to the clear front-runner, Pat Bertoletti.\u000A\u000AI try to interview Pat, but to no avail. He\u0027s so hyped-up on sugar he\u0027s pacing around the lobby like a man on fire. They all are. I manage to catch Bob for a moment. \u0022I\u0027m not happy,\u0022 he says. \u0022I woke up at 3:45 a.m. I\u0027m going to get home at midnight. And I had to talk my way into prize money to cover my expenses.\u0022 And then he\u0027s gone, too. I\u0027m beginning to reassess my idea that Bob seems content.\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve never seen so many people experience such a profound sugar rush all at the same time. They\u0027re like windup dolls, lost in the middle of nowhere, discombobulated without enforceable rules to keep them steady, pacing around and around, starving for order.\u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000APictured: seafood (that\u0027s Bob Shoudt in the B.O.B. hat)\u000A\u000AAnd now the big one. Coney Island. The Fourth of July. The Nathan\u0027s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Championship, with a $10,000 first prize. \u0022The only one,\u0022 Pat Bertoletti tells me, \u0022the public really cares about.\u0022\u000A\u000AThousands have gathered on the boardwalk by the beach. Many are chanting \u0022U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u0022 Onto the giant stage marches a procession of stilt walkers, dwarves dressed as Uncle Sam, cheerleaders, bodybuilders, a girl singing \u0022The Star-Spangled Banner.\u0022 Presiding over the pageantry is the legendary emcee George Shea, wearing a straw boater. ESPN is filming it all for a 3 p.m. broadcast.\u000A\u000AThe eaters are crowded into a little room backstage where thousands of hot dogs are being mass-cooked. They\u0027re like gladiators sharing a dressing room with the lions. Matt Stonie is separate from the others. He\u0027s outside, pacing nervously. I wave at him but know to leave him alone. Last night I bumped into him at the Manhattan hotel where many of the eaters were staying. \u0022I\u0027m dreading the thought of eating all those hot dogs,\u0022 he told me, seeming agitated. \u0022It\u0027s so miserable. It\u0027s going to be hot, and the taste of it will be awful. It\u0027s like a bor knowing that every punch is going to hurt.\u0022 But when I ask if he thinks he has a chance to win, he says, \u0022If Joey Chestnut pukes, if Pat Bertoletti\u0027s not on his game, if I have a good day...\u0022\u000A\u000AJoey and Pat sit next to each other backstage but say nothing. Joey once told me they rarely talk before an event. Sometimes they\u0027ll heartily slap each other on the back in the moments before a contest begins, feigning friendliness, when what they\u0027re actually trying to do is irritate each other. So it was all the more remarkable when, last night at the hotel, I saw the two men huddled in a corner, speaking quietly. It was a melancholy and surprising conversation. Pat was asking Joey, \u0022When you retire, will you give me the secret?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You\u0027ve seen everything I do,\u0022 Joey replied.\u000A\u000AI turned to Pat. \u0022Do you sometimes feel like Buzz Aldrin to Joey\u0027s Neil Armstrong?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022For sure,\u0022 he said. Despite the tough-guy mustache and scary Mohawk, there was a real sweetness to Pat. He seemed resigned to the fact that he has hit the ceiling, that he\u0027ll always be second best. And he\u0027s had enough, he said. He\u0027s getting out of this crazy sport.\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t think I can ever win [hot dogs],\u0022 he told Joey and me. \u0022And I\u0027ve done everything else.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You might quit everything?\u0022 I asked.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah,\u0022 said Pat.\u000A\u000AThen Joey said, \u0022I\u0027ve thought about getting out, too.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You want out, too?\u0022 said Pat, incredulous.\u000A\u000A\u0022I do,\u0022 said Joey.\u000A\u000A\u0022Why?\u0022 I asked him.\u000A\u000AHe backpedaled slightly. \u0022It\u0027s not that I want out,\u0022 he said, \u0022but I don\u0027t want to linger.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat he meant is that once you\u0027re number one, there\u0027s nowhere to go. Joey is trapped at number one like Pat is trapped at number two.\u000A\u000A\u0022My goal is seven [Nathan\u0027s titles] in a row,\u0022 Joey said. \u0022Next year could very well be my last.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Do you also want to quit because you realize it\u0027s a bizarre way to live your life?\u0022 I asked him.\u000A\u000A\u0022Probably,\u0022 Joey said.\u000A\u000AThe truth is, rarely have I done a story about something that\u0027s so utterly, existentially pointless and so emblematic of the American tendency to go way too far. And Joey and Pat know it.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m more than just a competitive eater,\u0022 Joey told us. \u0022I\u0027m a smart guy. I could be an awesome park ranger.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022That would be a great job,\u0022 I agreed.\u000A\u000A\u0022A park ranger in Alaska!\u0022 said Joey. \u0022You get a gun! \u0027Hey! Make sure you put out that campfire! Hey! Clean up your garbage!\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AJoey looked at me then, and he smiled.\u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000APictured: ribs\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s time for the women\u0027s contest. Which brings the first great surprise of the day. Maria Edible. She\u0027s a disaster. Onstage she looks ghostly white, in agony. She manages only eighteen and a half hot dogs (two fewer than her personal best). The winner for the second year in a row is Sonya Thomas, a.k.a. the Black Widow, the fourth-ranked eater in the world, who sets a new women\u0027s record with forty-five. I find Maria after it\u0027s over. She\u0027s slumped against a wall backstage. \u0022I don\u0027t know what happened...,\u0022 she\u0027s murmuring.\u000A\u000AI want to ask her more, but the floor manager hurries in. It\u0027s time for the men to line up.\u000A\u000AHalfway through the contest, something impossible seems to be happening. \u0022Matt Stonie!\u0022 George Shea is yelling into the microphone. \u0022Many are calling him the new Joey Chestnut! This is amazing, ladies and gentlemen! Matt Stonie is doing so well he\u0027s only four hot dogs behind Joey Chestnut. Nineteen years of age! And yet he\u0027s the only one truly putting pressure on Joey Chestnut!\u0022\u000A\u000AMatt is out in front of Bob Shoudt and Pat Bertoletti and Tim \u0022Eater X\u0022 Janus. He\u0027s a man possessed, like Kobayashi on that famous day in 2001. He\u0027s gaining on Joey, all those years of pain propelling him on. Twenty-eight hot dogs, twenty-nine hot dogs, thirty hot dogs, thirty-one...\u000A\u000ABut then, suddenly, heartbreakingly, at thirty-four dogs into the contest, Matt hits a wall. (\u0022Died out,\u0022 he\u0027ll later say on Facebook.) The manic pace with which he\u0027d been inhaling hot dogs slows dramatically, and a look of defeat crosses his flushed, sweaty face.\u000A\u000A\u0022Their dreams and hopes begin to fade as they approach the end!\u0022 George Shea hollers as Joey\u0027s lead widens. \u0022If fate and destiny existed, they would surely concern themselves with the affairs of this man. But they do not exist! The future is the property of the iron-willed, and there is only one man who has an iron will and it is he, Joey Chestnut!\u0022\u000A\u000AThe final score: Joey, sixty-eight (matching his world record); Tim Janus, fifty-two and a quarter; Pat Bertoletti, fifty-one. Matt ends up fourth, with a total of forty-six, a personal best. It\u0027s Joey\u0027s sixth Nathan\u0027s title in a row, tying Kobayashi\u0027s streak from 2001 to 2006. The audience—many of whom are wearing Joey Chestnut T-shirts and holding Joey Chestnut signs—is screaming his name as he stands before them, exhausted and utterly spent, basking in their love.\u000A\u000AA few minutes later, as Joey wades triumphantly into the throng, holding his championship belt aloft, I remember something he told me a few months earlier: \u0022I have to learn to ignore my feelings. Not just the feeling of hunger and the feeling of full, but the feeling of embarrassment, too. I have to remember that this is only weird if I make it weird.\u0022\u000A\u000ASoon Joey is swallowed by the crowd, and I lose sight of him. All I can see now is the belt itself, its painted gold glinting in the relentless sun, bobbing along in a surging tide of red, white, and blue.\u000A\u000AJon Ronson\u0027s new anthology, Lost at Sea: The Jon Ronson Mysteries, comes out October 30.",

recent years, the &quot;sport&quot; of competitive eating has expanded from a Coney Island freak show into an international, well, freak show. Jon Ronson hit the contest trail with some of the circuit&#39;s deepest stomachs—men who devour unholy amounts of chicken wings in minutes flat; women who make stupid money mowing down quesadillas—and returned with a tale that answers the only question that really matters: Why?</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.0"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583061509f0bee56440e303/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-chest.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-chest.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-chest.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-chest.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583061509f0bee56440e303%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-chest.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-chest.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583061509f0bee56440e303%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-chest.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-chest.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.1">Here is a mountain of corned-beef sandwiches, each crammed with meat. Eleven men and one woman&#x2014;some of the world&apos;s top competitive eaters&#x2014;intently scrutinize the sandwiches as they&apos;re wheeled by on a trolley toward the stage. We&apos;re at an outdoor shopping mall in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, the site of the third annual TooJay&apos;s World Class Corned Beef Eating Championship. One contestant drove a thousand miles to be here. He got a flat tire and had to double back to Avis in the middle of the night, but he&apos;s made it, and he&apos;s ready to battle. I&apos;m intrigued and mystified by the dedication of these athletes, as some of them call themselves. Who are they? What motivates them? I notice them glancing at one another in complicated, intense ways.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2">But a sense of fatalistic doom pervades the air. This is because one man is quite simply predestined to win. His name is Joey Chestnut, and he&apos;s a charismatic, sweet-natured 28-year-old Californian in surprisingly good shape for someone who bulldozes hideous amounts of food into his stomach on a regular basis. In the past six years, Joey has completely dominated the &quot;sport&quot; of competitive eating as it has expanded from a once-a-year carnival stunt to a worldwide tour. He holds world records for hot dogs, asparagus, funnel cake, jalape&#xF1;o poppers, gyros, grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken wings, cheesesteaks, shrimp wontons, tacos, and at least a dozen other &quot;disciplines.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3">About 200 people have turned up to watch him try to break his own corned-beef-sandwich record. Fans surround Joey for his autograph. One of them sidles over to me. His name is Sam Barclay. He&apos;s such a devotee, he says, that he&apos;s actually got himself a job with the International Federation of Competitive Eating (IFOCE), the sport&apos;s governing body, as a helper and part-time emcee. And he is in total awe of Joey.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.5">&quot;Everyone, since the dawn of time, has eaten or they&apos;ve perished,&quot; Sam says. &quot;But <em>that</em> man is the best eater who has ever lived, in the history of the world.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.6">The fans are mostly ignoring Joey&apos;s challengers. There&apos;s the world number two, Pat &quot;Deep Dish&quot; Bertoletti, muscular, wiry, a Mohawk haircut, almost always the bridesmaid, rarely the bride. There&apos;s a beautiful woman in her twenties named Maria Edible&#x2014;a cupcake and a burger tattooed on her arm and the word EDIBLE tattooed inside her mouth. There&apos;s a bear of a guy named Bob Shoudt&#x2014;about the only family man on the circuit. He has three kids and puts any prize money he makes into their college funds. I notice another challenger&#x2014;a waif of a boy with long dark hair&#x2014;staring fidly at Joey from across the crowd.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.7">I approach Joey. &quot;Who&apos;s that boy?&quot; I whisper.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.8">&quot;Matt Stonie,&quot; he whispers back. &quot;He&apos;s new. He&apos;s good. I watched a YouTube video of him in training. You hear his mother in the background encouraging him. When I saw that, I thought, &apos;Why would she be encouraging him? There must be something wrong with him for her to be encouraging him to eat.&apos; &quot; Joey lowers his voice. &quot;Apparently when he was 15 he was anorexic.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.9">I take this in. &quot;Wow,&quot; I say. &quot;I&apos;m not so sure competitive eating is such a good idea for him.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.a">Joey nods. &quot;You&apos;d think someone with anorexia wouldn&apos;t <em>like</em> food,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s weird. He&apos;s a good eater. But I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll ever be an awesome eater, because surely he doesn&apos;t <em>love</em> to eat. I love to eat.&quot; He smiles slightly. &quot;I analyze them all. I&apos;ve got to always find a reason why they&apos;ll never beat me. So I&apos;m telling myself that if he doesn&apos;t have that love, I&apos;ll <em>always</em> be better than Matt Stonie.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.b">Our conversation is interrupted by the emcee, Rich Shea, who is telling the audience how blessed we Americans are to have the freedom to eat as many corned-beef sandwiches as we like under a big blue sky. He introduces the contestants. Each takes his place on the stage. Joey is, of course, last: &quot;...the bratwurst- and pork-rib-eating champion of the world, the calzone champion of the world, the Nathan&apos;s Famous hot-dog-eating CHAMPION OF THE WORLD! JOEY CHESTNUT!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.c"> &#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.d"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583061409f0bee56440e2f7/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-matt-stonie.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-matt-stonie.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-matt-stonie.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-matt-stonie.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583061409f0bee56440e2f7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-matt-stonie.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-matt-stonie.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583061409f0bee56440e2f7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-matt-stonie.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-matt-stonie.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.e"><em>Matt Stonie, the new kid</em></p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.f">For two days now, I&apos;ve been listening to Joey extol the sport as a sensei would a martial art. He has told me, for example, how he has studied the ingestion techniques of snakes: &quot;Their muscles are contracting constantly. You&apos;ll see when I&apos;m eating, there&apos;s a constant weird up-and-down motion. I&apos;m using my whole rib cage to compact the food.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.g">Then there are the years he&apos;s spent determining how long to fast before each contest (three days) and which oils best lubricate the digestive system. He&apos;s settled on an exact combination of specific brands of olive and fish oils, but he won&apos;t divulge more. &quot;I had to figure it out,&quot; he said, &quot;so why should I let it be known?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.h">So after all of Joey&apos;s talk of science and preparation, I was imagining the corned-beef contest to be somehow more graceful and balletic. But as Shea counts down to zero and the eating begins, what I see instead are twelve people grotesquely cramming huge piles of meat and fat-sodden rye bread into their mouths. The juice drips down their arms, saturating their shirts. Their puffed-out cheeks are beetroot red. They resemble sweaty, meat-smeared squirrels. The sickly smell of fat permeates the hot air. I notice that the fastest eaters are squeezing the sandwiches in their clenched fists before swallowing them. With one hand they&apos;re shoveling in the food, with the other they&apos;re gulping liters of water or, in the case of Pat Bertoletti, bright red cherry limeade. Coupled with the semi-masticated sandwiches that   are spraying from their mouths in globules as they slobber onto themselves and the table, the whole thing looks like an unimaginable crime scene.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.i">It&apos;s a ten-minute contest. By minute six, most of the field is belching and cramping. But not Joey Chestnut. Pat Bertoletti is doing his level best to keep pace with the champ, and young Matt Stonie seems remarkably adept for someone so slight. But Joey is on another level. He&apos;s Usain Bolt, but with sandwiches.<strong> </strong>He had been telling the truth about the &quot;weird up-and-down motion&quot; in his rib cage. He looks like he&apos;s performing a disquieting contemporary dance routine. &quot;In competitive eating there&apos;s a natural slowdown,&quot; Sam Barclay tells me. &quot;But Joey? Nonstop.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.j">We are witnessing a new world record! Joey devours twenty corned-beef sandwiches, shattering his previous record by five and a half. Barclay shakes his head in wonder. &quot;It&apos;s not pretty,&quot; he concedes. &quot;But it <em>is</em> beautiful.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.k">Joey collects his $5,000 prize money, poses for the cameras, and disappears behind the stage, where I find him looking terrible. &quot;I&apos;ve got heatstroke,&quot; he murmurs.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.l">&quot;It&apos;s lucky you&apos;re not flying home until tomorrow,&quot; I say.

And it is as old   as America itself&#x2014;or maybe it started in the early &apos;70s.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.t">The fact is, it&apos;s tough to suss out the history of the sport through the thick-as-mustard layer of PR myth that has been slathered onto it by generations of pitchmen. There are tales (possibly true) of pioneers staging contests in the early days of the republic to celebrate bountiful harvests. Nathan&apos;s Famous, the Coney Island hot-dog vendor whose annual Fourth of July extravaganza remains the Super Bowl of the sport, claims its event goes back to 1916, when a group of immigrants put on a contest to test their patriotic mettle. This is (almost certainly) untrue. The first Nathan&apos;s contest, as best anyone can remember, was actually held on July 4, 1972.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.u">And for the next twenty-five years, that&apos;s about all competitive eating amounted to&#x2014;the Nathan&apos;s contest and a smattering of much smaller events across the land. To expand, the sport needed its own Vince McMahon, an entrepreneur showman with a vision. In 1997 it found two: brothers Rich and George Shea. George had done PR for Nathan&apos;s and saw opportunity in expanding the tour and soliciting sponsors. The Sheas created the IFOCE, and over the next few years, everything ambled along without much fanfare. Until, that is, July 4, 2001&#x2014;the most extraordinary day in the history of   competitive eating.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.v">Watching the news footage filmed that day, during the minutes before everything changed forever, I was struck by how lackadaisical things seemed. It was a   hot Coney Island morning. The competitors, milling behind the Nathan&apos;s stage, looked overweight and carefree, nothing like the focused gym rats of today. One mentioned to a TV reporter that he&apos;d just had a nice big breakfast.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.w">&quot;Why?&quot; she asked, surprised.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.x">He shrugged. &quot;Why not?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.y">She didn&apos;t bother interviewing the skinny Japanese kid nobody recognized. But then the contest began. And by the time the Americans had consumed about eight hot dogs each, the quiet newcomer from Nagano had demolished a staggering thirty. Until that day, the Nathan&apos;s Famous record was twenty-five and one eighth dogs in twelve minutes. Takeru Kobayashi ate fifty.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.z">He became an international media sensation, the subject of thousands of gleeful headlines. CNN put him on a list of &quot;Japan&apos;s greatest sports heroes.&quot; And he remained unbeaten&#x2014;and virtually synonymous with competitive eating&#x2014;for six years. But then a new and even greater virtuoso emerged.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.10">Joey &quot;Jaws&quot; Chestnut grew up in Vallejo, California. Being the third of four boys, he was always searching for something he could beat his older brothers at. And that thing seemed to be eating very fast. He showed such a talent for it that in 2005, his youngest brother entered him into a lobster competition in Reno.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.11">&quot;I&apos;d never eaten lobster before,&quot; Joey told me. &quot;I was 21. I didn&apos;t know what the heck I was doing. I was scooping guts. But I tied for third. And the two men who beat me didn&apos;t look good. One was Bob Shoudt. He seemed in pain. And I felt fine! I was &apos;Oh, my God, they look like they&apos;re dying. And I can eat so much more!&apos; I knew I was made for it after that contest.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.12">Joey decided that night to dedicate his life to the pursuit. He became obsessed&#x2014;&quot;nervous, always nervous&quot;&#x2014;and his discipline paid off in Coney Island on July 4, 2007, when he scarfed down sixty-six hot dogs before an audience of 40,000, besting Kobayashi by a three-dog margin. Joey defended his title the next year and every year since. At the 2009 Nathan&apos;s contest, he set a new world record with sixty-eight hot dogs. Last year, between his prize money and sponsorships, he raked in $205,000.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.13">Kobayashi, meanwhile, hasn&apos;t competed in an IFOCE-sanctioned contest since 2009, the year he finished second to Joey at Nathan&apos;s for the third time in a row. (&quot;Kobayashi won&apos;t talk to me,&quot; Joey says. &quot;He hates me.&quot;) I assume this is due to his shame over becoming second best, but when I reach him on the phone, he denies this. Through an interpreter, he tells me that the Sheas &quot;love to say, &apos;Kobi isn&apos;t man enough to eat up against our dude Chestnut.&apos; But it has never been that. They wanted me to sign a contract that gave away all my human rights!&quot; The IFOCE contract, he says, forbade him from competing in any non-Shea contests, which he took as a declaration of war. Nowadays, Kobayashi is still a draw, but he exists in a parallel universe of events that seem more about appearance fees and PR than official competition.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.14">When a sport starts spawning feuds and sideshows, that&apos;s when you know it&apos;s turning into something truly large.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.15"> &#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.16"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558306153655c24c6c956c31/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-hotdogs.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-hotdogs.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-hotdogs.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-hotdogs.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306153655c24c6c956c31%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-hotdogs.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-hotdogs.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306153655c24c6c956c31%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-hotdogs.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-hotdogs.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.17">At the corned-beef contest, no one was surprised that Pat Bertoletti came in second, with eighteen and a half sandwiches. He and Joey were neck and neck until the final moments, when Pat, a 26-year-old caterer from Chicago,<strong> </strong>floundered and Joey seemed to accelerate. It was who came in third (with fourteen and a half sandwiches) that shocked everyone&#x2014;and announced the arrival of a rising star. The bronze went to the waifish mystery kid, Matt Stonie.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.18">I found him after the contest, sitting in the shade. Unlike Joey, he looked fine. We got to talking about his life. He&apos;s 19. Back in middle school, he said, &quot;I was an A student, but then I went down to B&apos;s and C&apos;s. My parents freaked out and sent me to boarding school. I hated it. It was really strict. I kept myself isolated. I got kind of confused about who I am.&quot; He paused. &quot;I&apos;ve always loved food. But I began to have a hard time telling myself what was correct. I remember thinking, If I lose five pounds now, I can go home this weekend and have a good time with my friends, eating burgers....&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.19">That&apos;s how the anorexia started. It wasn&apos;t long before he weighed eighty-five pounds. His life became all about doctors and psychiatrists. Finally he decided to reclaim some control. &quot;So I utilized competitive eating to try to take care of myself in general.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.1a">&quot;Have any doctors suggested that competitive eating may not be the best way to get over an eating disorder?&quot; I asked.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.1b">&quot;My doctor loves it,&quot; Matt said. &quot;I&apos;m super healthy.

To be a titan, you need twenty-four-seven commitment.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.20">&quot;Joey thinks your happiness is the reason you rarely win,&quot; I tell Bob.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.21">&quot;Oh, he knows it,&quot; Bob says. &quot;I was talking to him Tuesday night. He said, &apos;Why aren&apos;t you training for the cupcakes?&apos; I said, &apos;Joey, I got to pick up my daughter, drive her to dance class, drive my other daughter to basketball...&apos; &quot; A faraway look crosses Bob&apos;s face. &quot;But when I&apos;m at the table...I can&apos;t let on in an interview how seriously I take it, because I&apos;d probably be committed to a mental hospital.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.22">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.23">&quot;Time slows down,&quot; he says. &quot;You don&apos;t hear the announcer. You just have this...flow.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.24">&quot;When were you last in that altered state?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.25">&quot;Probably when I did ninety-five hamburgers [sliders] in eight minutes,&quot; Bob says. &quot;I was just totally locked down.&quot; He pauses. &quot;I know it&apos;s viewed as horror, shock, a sideshow. But when people see us up there, it blows them away. Which is why the groupies are insane.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.26">&quot;Groupies?!&quot; I say.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.27">&quot;I&apos;m thoroughly happily married, so I&apos;m on the sidelines,&quot; says Bob. &quot;But I&apos;ve seen stuff. Doors open.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.28">&quot;I&apos;d imagine it would be a turnoff,&quot; I say.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.29">&quot;Me, too.&quot; Bob shrugs. &quot;But no.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2a"> &#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2b">We&apos;re in Waterloo, Iowa, at the Isle Casino Hotel, a bleak resort plopped into a mass of gray nothingness&#x2014;miles of farmland. First prize for the cupcakes contest is just $1,500. The stage has been ignominiously set up in the shadows under the lobby escalators, far from the slot machines, which is the only bustling part of the building. And by bustling, I mean a handful of elderly people robotically pressing the spin buttons as if toiling on a production line. I can&apos;t imagine how even a competitive-eating contest will lure them from the slots.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2c">The world&apos;s number two and three&#x2014;Pat Bertoletti and Tim &quot;Eater X&quot; Janus&#x2014;are somewhere in the building, but Joey is not. He has skipped this event, believing it to be shoddily organized. Matt Stonie is absent, too. Casino contests are 21 and over, so Matt has to wait two years before he&apos;s allowed to compete.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2d">I stand with Bob Shoudt in the lobby. He seems happy, energetic, I suppose because, with Joey not here, he has a chance to win.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2e">Bob tells me he&apos;d love the opportunity to have an illicit look at a cupcake.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2f">&quot;Would you eat it?&quot; I ask him.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2g">&quot;I&apos;d probably just put it in my mouth and spit it out,&quot; he says. &quot;Will it be dense? Dry?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2h">&quot;Wouldn&apos;t that give you an unfair advantage?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2i">Bob looks at me. And then something happens. Perhaps this forlorn casino has made him feel forlorn about the sport he loves so much. But it all pours out. Competitive eating, he says, is rife with unfair advantages.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2j">&quot;I&apos;ve seen everything,&quot; he says. &quot;People throwing hot dogs under the table. People making the biggest messes you can imagine.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2k">My eyes widen. &quot;So there&apos;s such a mess under the table it&apos;s impossible to determine what counts as an eaten thing?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2l">&quot;Oh, there&apos;s techniques,&quot; says Bob. &quot;People suddenly get happy feet.&quot; He mimes an eater dropping an item of food and then covertly stamping it into the ground. I&apos;m appalled. Cheating makes everything pointless. And then Bob confesses that&#x2014;if need be&#x2014;he will be one of those cheaters. When his wife is in the crowd, they use pre-arranged signals. &quot;If the eaters are dropping stuff like crazy, she&apos;ll give a meaningless cheer. I&apos;ll understand. Suddenly the food gets very slippery for me.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2m"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583061509f0bee56440e309/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-corn-beef.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-corn-beef.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-corn-beef.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-corn-beef.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583061509f0bee56440e309%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-corn-beef.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-corn-beef.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583061509f0bee56440e309%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-corn-beef.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-corn-beef.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2n">_Competitive eating: It&apos;s not just for hot dogs anymore.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2o">Pictured: Corned-beef sandwiches_</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2p">He gives me a look that says: Don&apos;t judge me until you&apos;ve walked in my shoes. Leave the Gandhi-like behavior to the fools who don&apos;t mind losing to the cheaters.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2q">Suddenly something over my shoulder catches Bob&apos;s eye. &quot;The cupcakes!&quot; he exclaims.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2r">A man is wheeling some silver cabinets toward the eating table. We hurry over. &quot;Is it possible to look at a cupcake?&quot; Bob asks the man.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2s">&quot;Sure,&quot; he says. Bob takes one and instantly scurries to the toilets. He&apos;s gone so fast I don&apos;t have time to follow.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2t">The contestants drift in. Maria keeps to herself in the shadows. I&apos;ve calculated that each cupcake contains around 500 calories, which means the contestants will be eating something like 25,000 calories in eight minutes. It would take a normal person eating a normal amount of calories ten days to consume that many. I find this horrifying, but no one else seems to care.<strong> </strong>Also horrifying:<strong> </strong>There are buckets under the stage. Today&apos;s emcee, Dave Keating, explains they&apos;re for &quot;reversals. We don&apos;t use the V-word on the circuit.&quot; A reversal, by the way, results in immediate disqualification.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2u">A few dozen gamblers amble into the lobby, joining the small crowd of fans and family members who&apos;ve made the journey. And then there&apos;s the countdown, and the contest begins.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2v">I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s the absence of Joey that&apos;s spurring the eaters so frenziedly on, or whether the sugar rush is giving them a kind of frantic energy, but within a few minutes their eyes are bulging, their bodies are shaking, and there&apos;s no slowdown. Each cupcake only seems to fire them up for more. And suddenly it is pandemonium. Something happens that (I&apos;m later told) has happened only once before in the history of competitive eating.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2w">&quot;We&apos;re OUT OF CUPCAKES!&quot; yells Dave the emcee. &quot;It&apos;s first to finish! First to finish, ladies and gentlemen!&quot; Nobody seems to know what this means, but Dave keeps yelling it: &quot;First to finish! I&apos;ve never seen anything like this! This is an absolutely new record, ladies and gentlemen!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2x">He&apos;s putting on a brave face, trying to make the debacle seem exciting, but it isn&apos;t. It&apos;s confusing. Some competitors, like Bob and Pat, have no cupcakes left, so they&apos;re just standing there. Others, like Maria, are still eating. Bob starts yelling at Dave. I leap onto the stage, my voice recorder in my hand, to chronicle the chaos. Some casino staff members run across the lobby to intercept me. &quot;Sir!&quot; they&apos;re yelling. &quot;Sir! Sir! Competitors only on the stage!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2y">&quot;But I&apos;m from <em>GQ!</em>&quot; I yell back. &quot;I&apos;m ACCESS ALL AREAS!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.2z">&quot;Get to the side!&quot; the security guard is hollering at me. &quot;TO THE SIDE.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.30">Maria is standing there, a cupcake in her hand, staring limply into space. This commotion doesn&apos;t really involve her, nobody&apos;s looking at her, and she looks lost.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.31">Bob is still shouting. Dave continues in vain to make it sound historic. &quot;Six hundred and sixty cupcakes eaten in six minutes! It&apos;s a brand-new record!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.32">Things finally calm down after ten minutes or so, and I wander over to Dave. &quot;What a calamity,&quot; I say.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.33">&quot;It really sucked,&quot; he says. &quot;And of course we have a fucking reporter here.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.34">&quot;What went wrong?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.35">&quot;The cupcakes were lighter than last year,&quot; he says. &quot;We had a wider field. It was a perfect storm.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.36">The top five competitors agree to split the prize money, with a little extra going to the clear front-runner, Pat Bertoletti.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.37">I try to interview Pat, but to no avail. He&apos;s so hyped-up on sugar he&apos;s pacing around the lobby like a man on fire. They all are. I manage to catch Bob for a moment. &quot;I&apos;m not happy,&quot; he says. &quot;I woke up at 3:45 a.m. I&apos;m going to get home at midnight. And I had to talk my way into prize money to cover my expenses.&quot; And then he&apos;s gone, too. I&apos;m beginning to reassess my idea that Bob seems content.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.38">I&apos;ve never seen so many people experience such a profound sugar rush all at the same time. They&apos;re like windup dolls, lost in the middle of nowhere, discombobulated without enforceable rules to keep them steady, pacing around and around, starving for order.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.39"> &#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3a"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558306143655c24c6c956c22/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-seafood.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-seafood.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-seafood.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-seafood.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306143655c24c6c956c22%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-seafood.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-seafood.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306143655c24c6c956c22%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-seafood.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-11-full-plates-full-plates-seafood.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3b"><em>Pictured: seafood (that&apos;s Bob Shoudt in the B.O.B. hat)</em></p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3c">And now the big one. Coney Island. The Fourth of July. The Nathan&apos;s Famous International Hot Dog Eating Championship, with a $10,000 first prize. &quot;The only one,&quot; Pat Bertoletti tells me, &quot;the public really cares about.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3d">Thousands have gathered on the boardwalk by the beach. Many are chanting &quot;U.S.A.! U.S.A.!&quot; Onto the giant stage marches a procession of stilt walkers, dwarves dressed as Uncle Sam, cheerleaders, bodybuilders, a girl singing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; Presiding over the pageantry is the legendary emcee George Shea, wearing a straw boater. ESPN is filming it all for a 3 p.m. broadcast.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3e">The eaters are crowded into a little room backstage where thousands of hot dogs are being mass-cooked. They&apos;re like gladiators sharing a dressing room with the lions. Matt Stonie is separate from the others. He&apos;s outside, pacing nervously. I wave at him but know to leave him alone. Last night I bumped into him at the Manhattan hotel where many of the eaters were staying. &quot;I&apos;m dreading the thought of eating all those hot dogs,&quot; he told me, seeming agitated. &quot;It&apos;s so miserable. It&apos;s going to be hot, and the taste of it will be awful. It&apos;s like a bor knowing that every punch is going to hurt.&quot; But when I ask if he thinks he has a chance to win, he says, &quot;If Joey Chestnut pukes, if Pat Bertoletti&apos;s not on his game, if I have a good day...&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3f">Joey and Pat sit next to each other backstage but say nothing. Joey once told me they rarely talk before an event. Sometimes they&apos;ll heartily slap each other on the back in the moments before a contest begins, feigning friendliness, when what they&apos;re actually trying to do is irritate each other. So it was all the more remarkable when, last night at the hotel, I saw the two men huddled in a corner, speaking quietly. It was a melancholy and surprising conversation. Pat was asking Joey, &quot;When you retire, will you give me the secret?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3g">&quot;You&apos;ve seen everything I do,&quot; Joey replied.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3h">I turned to Pat. &quot;Do you sometimes feel like Buzz Aldrin to Joey&apos;s Neil Armstrong?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3i">&quot;For sure,&quot; he said. Despite the tough-guy mustache and scary Mohawk, there was a real sweetness to Pat. He seemed resigned to the fact that he has hit the ceiling, that he&apos;ll always be second best. And he&apos;s had enough, he said. He&apos;s getting out of this crazy sport.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3j">&quot;I don&apos;t think I can ever win [hot dogs],&quot; he told Joey and me. &quot;And I&apos;ve done everything else.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3k">&quot;You might quit <em>everything?</em>&quot; I asked.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3l">&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Pat.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3m">Then Joey said, &quot;I&apos;ve thought about getting out, too.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3n">&quot;<em>You</em> want out, too?&quot; said Pat, incredulous.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3o">&quot;I do,&quot; said Joey.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3p">&quot;Why?&quot; I asked him.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3q">He backpedaled slightly. &quot;It&apos;s not that I <em>want</em> out,&quot; he said, &quot;but I don&apos;t want to <em>linger.</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.3r">What he meant is that once you&apos;re number one, there&apos;s nowhere to go.

Which brings the first great surprise of the day. Maria Edible. She&apos;s a disaster. Onstage she looks ghostly white, in agony. She manages only eighteen and a half hot dogs (two fewer than her personal best). The winner for the second year in a row is Sonya Thomas, a.k.a. the Black Widow, the fourth-ranked eater in the world, who sets a new women&apos;s record with forty-five. I find Maria after it&apos;s over. She&apos;s slumped against a wall backstage. &quot;I don&apos;t know what happened...,&quot; she&apos;s murmuring.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.44">I want to ask her more, but the floor manager hurries in. It&apos;s time for the men to line up.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.45">Halfway through the contest, something impossible seems to be happening. &quot;Matt Stonie!&quot; George Shea is yelling into the microphone. &quot;Many are calling him the new Joey Chestnut! This is amazing, ladies and gentlemen! Matt Stonie is doing so well he&apos;s only four hot dogs behind Joey Chestnut. Nineteen years of age! And yet he&apos;s the only one truly putting pressure on Joey Chestnut!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.46">Matt is out in front of Bob Shoudt and Pat Bertoletti and Tim &quot;Eater X&quot; Janus. He&apos;s a man possessed, like Kobayashi on that famous day in 2001. He&apos;s gaining on Joey, all those years of pain propelling him on. Twenty-eight hot dogs, twenty-nine hot dogs, thirty hot dogs, thirty-one...</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.47">But then, suddenly, heartbreakingly, at thirty-four dogs into the contest, Matt hits a wall. (&quot;Died out,&quot; he&apos;ll later say on Facebook.) The manic pace with which he&apos;d been inhaling hot dogs slows dramatically, and a look of defeat crosses his flushed, sweaty face.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.48">&quot;Their dreams and hopes begin to fade as they approach the end!&quot; George Shea hollers as Joey&apos;s lead widens. &quot;If fate and destiny existed, they would surely concern themselves with the affairs of this man. But they do not exist! The future is the property of the iron-willed, and there is only one man who has an iron will and it is he, Joey Chestnut!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.49">The final score: Joey, sixty-eight (matching his world record); Tim Janus, fifty-two and a quarter; Pat Bertoletti, fifty-one. Matt ends up fourth, with a total of forty-six, a personal best. It&apos;s Joey&apos;s sixth Nathan&apos;s title in a row, tying Kobayashi&apos;s streak from 2001 to 2006. The audience&#x2014;many of whom are wearing Joey Chestnut T-shirts and holding Joey Chestnut signs&#x2014;is screaming his name as he stands before them, exhausted and utterly spent, basking in their love.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.4a">A few minutes later, as Joey wades triumphantly into the throng, holding his championship belt aloft, I remember something he told me a few months earlier: &quot;I have to learn to ignore my feelings. Not just the feeling of hunger and the feeling of full, but the feeling of embarrassment, too. I have to remember that this is only weird if I <em>make</em> it weird.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.4b">Soon Joey is swallowed by the crowd, and I lose sight of him. All I can see now is the belt itself, its painted gold glinting in the relentless sun, bobbing along in a surging tide of red, white, and blue.</p><p data-reactid=".1a77qkjdurk.1.1.0.0.4.4c"><em>Jon
