Hughes, a Kentucky billionaire and horse breeder, says the debate over income inequality makes him feel like \u0022an enemy of the state.\u0022\u000A\u000AAs I drive along the Pacific Coast Highway into Malibu, I catch glimpses of incredible cliff-top mansions discreetly obscured from the road, which is littered with abandoned gas stations and run-down mini-marts. The office building I pull up to is quite drab and utilitarian. There are no ornaments on the conference-room shelves—just a bottle of hand sanitizer. An elderly, broad-shouldered man greets me. He\u0027s wearing jogging pants. They don\u0027t look expensive. His name is B. Wayne Hughes.\u000A\u000A You almost definitely won\u0027t have heard of him. He hardly ever gives interviews. He only agreed to this one because—as his people explained to me—income disparity is a hugely important topic for him. They didn\u0027t explain how it was important, so I assumed he thought it was bad.\u000A\u000A I approached Wayne, as he\u0027s known, for wholly mathematical reasons. I\u0027d worked out that there are six degrees of economic separation between a guy making ten bucks an hour and a Forbes billionaire, if you multiply each person\u0027s income by five. So I decided to journey across America to meet one representative of each multiple. By connecting these income brackets to actual people, I hoped to understand how money shapes their lives—and the life of the country—at a moment when the gap between rich and poor is such a combustible issue. Everyone in this story, then, makes roughly five times more than the last person makes. There\u0027s a dishwasher in Miami with an unbelievably stressful life, some nice middle-class Iowans with quite difficult lives, me with a perfectly fine if frequently anxiety-inducing life, a millionaire with an annoyingly happy life, a multimillionaire with a stunningly amazing life, and then, finally, at the summit, this great American eagle, Wayne, who tells me he\u0027s \u0022pissed off\u0022 right now.\u000A\u000A \u0022I live my life paying my tas and taking care of my responsibilities, and I\u0027m a little surprised to find out that I\u0027m an enemy of the state at this time in my life,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A He has a big, booming voice like an old-school billionaire, not one of those nerdy new billionaires.\u000A\u000A \u0022Has anyone said that to your face?\u0022 I ask him.\u000A\u000A \u0022Nobody has to,\u0022 says Wayne. \u0022Just watch what they\u0027re doing.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022You mean the Occupy Wall Street crowd?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Those guys are a bunch of jerks,\u0022 Wayne mutters, giving a dismissive wave that says, They\u0027re just a sideshow. \u0022Politically I\u0027m on the enemy list. I\u0027ve lived my whole life doing what I thought was right, and now I\u0027m an enemy of the state.\u0022\u000A\u000A Is he, though? It\u0027s true that income inequality is a reliable applause line on the campaign trail. Here\u0027s Obama in a recent speech: \u0022What drags down our entire economy is when there\u0027s an ever widening chasm between the ultrarich and everybody else.\u0022 Romney, meanwhile, likes to call this rhetoric \u0022the bitter politics of envy.\u0022 As he told a receptive crowd in West Palm Beach, Florida, \u0022I believe in a merit nation, an opportunity nation, where people by virtue of their education and hard work and risk-taking and their dreams—and maybe a little luck—could achieve great things.\u0022\u000A\u000A But the reality is that rarely are enemies of the state treated so well. Except for a brief stint in the late \u002780s and early \u002790s, their tax rate is at an eighty-year low. In the 1940s and 1950s, the top tax bracket paid more than 80 percent. It was 70 percent when Reagan took office, 40 percent under Clinton, and now, under Obama, it\u0027s 35 percent. But the very, very rich don\u0027t pay even that. By taking full advantage of an investor-friendly tax code, which takes a much smaller bite out of capital gains and dividends than it does for salaried income, the 400 richest Americans pay, on average, 18 percent tax.\u000A\u000A Wayne won\u0027t reveal exactly what he pays now that he\u0027s at the top, but he\u0027s happy to tell me he began at the bottom.\u000A\u000A \u0022Have you read The Grapes of Wrath?\u0022 he asks. \u0022That was my family. My dad was a sharecropper in western Oklahoma. When the dust storms came and everything got wiped out, they came to California. The guys with the mattresses on the tops of their cars in the movie? That was the way it was.\u0022\u000A\u000A They had nothing. His father got a job winding coils that went into refrigeration units. Wayne grew up in east Los Angeles, went to college, joined the navy, got married. For a while he worked for unglamorous-sounding businesses with names like the Frieden Corporation, but nothing stuck. He had a couple of children. He wasn\u0027t thriving. He had to do something.\u000A\u000A And then, in 1972, he had an idea: People have too much stuff and nowhere to keep it. So he bought some land in San Diego and put up a building with 200 self-storage spaces. \u0022After that it was just building the units up, one at a time. For years and years. That\u0027s all. You don\u0027t get money unless you have a lot of talent, which I don\u0027t have, or you work hard, which is what I do. We don\u0027t have any golden touch here.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022How many buildings have you got now?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A \u0022Maybe 2,300,\u0022 he says. \u0022With 500 or 600 units inside each.\u0022\u000A\u000A Wayne says he never once stopped to contemplate the amount of money he was making. \u0022I was just looking at getting the best locations I could and getting the buildings opened and getting the tenants and getting the cash flow and on and on,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A \u0022You never once thought, \u0027This money is cascading in. I am worth 4 BILLION DOLLARS\u0027?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A He shakes his head. \u0022I don\u0027t spend any time at all thinking about my personal wealth. I suppose if I had nothing, I might think, \u0027I have nothing.\u0027 But when we decided to go public and I saw how much money there was, I was very surprised.\u0022\u000A\u000A In 2006, Wayne was America\u0027s sixty-first-richest man, according to Forbes, with $4.1 billion. Today he\u0027s the 242nd richest (and the 683rd richest in the world), with $1.9 billion. He\u0027s among  the least famous people on the list. In fact, he once asked the  magazine to remove his name. \u0022I said, \u0027It\u0027s an imposition. Forbes should not be doing that. It\u0027s the wrong thing to do. It puts my children and my grandchildren at risk.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022And what did they say?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A \u0022They said when Trump called up, he said the number next to his name was too small.\u0022\u000A\u000A When Wayne is in Malibu, he stays in his daughter\u0027s spare room. His home is a three-bedroom farmhouse on a working stud farm in Lexington, Kentucky.\u000A\u000A \u0022I have no fancy living at all,\u0022 he says. \u0022Well, I have a house in Sun Valley. Five acres in the woods. I guess that\u0027s fancy.\u0022\u000A\u000A I like Wayne very much. He\u0027s avuncular and salt of the earth. I admire how far he has risen from the Grapes of Wrath circumstances into which he was born; he\u0027s the very embodiment of the American Dream. I\u0027m surprised, though, and a little taken aback, by his anger. I\u0027ll return to Wayne—and the curiously aggrieved way he views his place in the world—a bit later.\u000A\u000A But first let\u0027s plummet all the way down to the very, very bottom, as if we\u0027re falling down a well, to a concrete slab of a house in a downtrodden Miami neighborhood called Little Haiti.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHow to Live on $200 a Week\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestMaurose Frantz, Age: 26  Frantz says he has never even seen a customer or a menu at the steak house where he toils in the kitchen. \u0022If I get money,\u0022 says the Haitian immigrant, \u0022I\u0027m going to leave.\u0022\u000A\u000AA young man peers into a crack of sunlight that emerges from behind one of the sheets that block out all his windows. His name is Maurose Frantz, but he goes by Frantz. He can\u0027t afford air-conditioning, hence the sheets, so it\u0027s very dark and stuffy in here. Frantz lives with five other people—his mom, stepdad, grandparents, and little brother—and the entire house is the size of a typical suburban living room. As it happens, the view down the dusty, potholed street includes not only used-car lots but also self-storage facilities—the idea that made Wayne his billions.\u000A\u000A \u0022Outside is dangerous,\u0022 Frantz says. \u0022One time someone pulled up and said to me, \u0027Do you need a gun?\u0027 He showed me a gun! I said, \u0027I can\u0027t hear you, man.\u0027 Another time my grandpa—they jumped him. They took his wallet. They slotted him. He cried, he cried, he cried.\u0022\u000A\u000A Frantz is Haitian. His accent is very strong, and I\u0027m constantly asking him to repeat what he said: \u0022They did what to your grandpa? They slotted him? Slattered him? Sorry?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Slapped him,\u0022 Frantz replies. \u0022Slapped.\u0022\u000A\u000A Frantz washes dishes at the Capital Grille restaurant, a posh steak house near the harbor in Miami\u0027s financial district. He nets $200 for a twenty-seven-hour week and receives no food stamps or government assistance of any kind. That means he makes in an hour what I make in five minutes and Wayne makes pretty much every time he breathes in and out.\u000A\u000A At the end of the week, Frantz gets an ATM card with his pay already loaded onto it. Sometimes when he clocks out at the end of the night, he says, he finds he\u0027s already been mysteriously clocked out by someone else. Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a restaurant workers\u0027 advocacy group, launched a class-action suit against Darden—the restaurant conglomerate that owns the Capital Grille—for this and other alleged improprieties. Frantz says he\u0027s repeatedly requested some kind of paper breakdown of how many hours he\u0027s been paid for and how much tax has come off, but they never give it to him, so he\u0027s stopped asking. He\u0027s also stopped asking for a promotion to busboy. He says they told him they\u0027d let him know, but they never did. According to ROC United, the Capital Grille regularly denies promotions to dark-skinned people. It\u0027s possible for a black worker to become a busboy, Frantz says, but he\u0027s never seen a black server. Darden, for its part, maintains that the Capital Grille pays its employees fairly and that the claims of discrimination are baseless.\u000A\u000A Last night, one of Frantz\u0027s co-workers threw away his shoes.\u000A\u000A \u0022I checked everywhere,\u0022 Frantz says. \u0022I checked in the garbage, but I couldn\u0027t find them. I called the sous-chef and I told him, \u0027I put down my shoes. Somebody threw them away.\u0027 He said, \u0027Frantz, you know me. I\u0027m cool with you. I treat you like a man. I give you all the respect you need. I talk to you about your life.\u0027 I said, \u0027I know, chef.\u0027 He respects me, the sous-chef. He said, \u0027I don\u0027t know what happened to your shoes. I can\u0027t tell you nothing.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A Frantz talks a lot about respect and the opposite of respect—humiliation. It\u0027s as if he\u0027s lowered his ambitions to the level that he can take all sorts of awfulness as long as people talk to him with a little respect. It occurs to me that his life might be better if he spent less time worrying about feeling disrespected and more time actively working to improve his conditions, but then I realize he is doing all he can. Putting his head above the parapet to talk to me is a brave step. (ROC United asked for volunteers on my behalf, and he was the one to agree.) But I can\u0027t see how his life will improve anytime soon. He\u0027s so far down America\u0027s financial pecking order he barely registers on it.\u000A\u000A I ask Frantz to show me his neighborhood. He says there\u0027s nothing really to see. He rarely goes out—only to work and to church and to play soccer. Everywhere else is too dangerous. When we head outside, I scurry from his front door to the car. A smashed-up police cruiser lies abandoned on the corner. We take a drive  past the one place on earth he has some fun: the soccer field in  the public park.\u000A\u000A Six miles later, we reach the Capital Grille. Usually he catches the bus, which takes an hour. When he works late and misses the 1 a.m. bus home, he has to stand there until the next one comes at 4 a.m.\u000A\u000A \u0022Do you ever wonder what the customers\u0027 lives are like?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A \u0022I don\u0027t know nothing about the customers,\u0022 says Frantz. \u0022I\u0027ve never seen them.\u0022\u000A\u000A I look at him. \u0022You\u0027ve never seen a customer?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A \u0022Never,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A \u0022Do you know how much the steaks cost?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A \u0022I never saw a menu,\u0022 he says. \u0022They\u0027re in the restaurant, not  the kitchen.\u0022\u000A\u000A His last words to me, before I head off to visit someone who makes five times what he does, are \u0022If I get money, I\u0027m going to leave.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHow to Live on $900 a Week\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestDennis Pallwitz II,  Age: 39. Pallwitz scrapes by on $900 a week—enough to qualify as middle-class but not to take his wife away for an anniversary weekend.\u000A\u000A Fifteen hundred miles from Frantz\u0027s neighborhood is a lovely leafy middle-class Des Moines suburb called Urbandale. There\u0027s mist and dew, and the lawns are so green they look painted. It\u0027s 7 a.m. and deserted and unseasonably chilly—a tornado warning will be issued in a few hours—but I\u0027m sure in warmer circumstances I\u0027d see children running around, in and out of one another\u0027s homes, and riding their bikes to school. The $900-a-week family who live here—Dennis and Rebecca Pallwitz and their two toddlers—have a ground-floor apartment in a tidy complex with a communal pool. Most of the properties here are detached family homes; theirs is an exception. I sit in their kitchen and tell them about Frantz.\u000A\u000A \u0022Oh,\u0022 gasps Rebecca sympathetically.\u000A\u000A \u0022I know,\u0022 I say. \u0022Imagine living in Miami and earning a fifth of what you earn. The stress must be unbelievable.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022It\u0027s another world,\u0022 says Rebecca.\u000A\u000A The Pallwitzes\u0027 fifth anniversary is approaching. \u0022We\u0027d like to go to the east of the state where we had our honeymoon,\u0022 Dennis says. \u0022But—\u0022 he glances at Rebecca—\u0022that would cost gas and food and a bed-and-breakfast stay, so maybe we\u0027ll stick around here, save the gas money, and get a hotel room for a couple of days.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022You can\u0027t afford to drive across the state?\u0022 I say in a startled screech. I sound like the Dowager Countess of Grantham from Downton Abbey. Speaking of which, last night in New York City, I got to see something Frantz has never seen: the inside of a Capital Grille restaurant. (I\u0027m guessing Dennis and Rebecca have never been to one, either.) There were stag heads and sculptures of horses and fine oil paintings of generic earls and lords and fox hunts. The milieu was very English country gentleman, although an English country gentleman would never put an e at the end of the word grill. It was delicious, and I didn\u0027t even think about what it cost. Almost every waiter was light-skinned, but I did see one dark-skinned man serving. So that was nice.\u000A\u000A \u0022But there\u0027s lots of stuff to do here in the Des Moines area that we still haven\u0027t done,\u0022 Dennis says, brightening. \u0022So...\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I know what I want to do,\u0022 says Rebecca.\u000A\u000A \u0022What\u0027s that?\u0022 says Dennis.\u000A\u000A \u0022The drive-in movie theater and then the Incredible Pizza,\u0022  she says. \u0022The Incredible Pizza\u0027s got games and a buffet. You can pay $30, eat as much as you want, then play games until the money runs out. They have this tunnel thing going on. That doesn\u0027t  cost anything. Our son can take his shoes off and run in there   for a while....\u0022\u000A\u000A Dennis smiles, but I can tell he thinks Rebecca has evoked a crappy way to spend a fifth anniversary.\u000A\u000A Dennis installs, maintains, and repairs \u0022a wide variety of home medical equipment, oxygen equipment, wheelchairs, a smattering of everything.\u0022 Rebecca stays home with the children. She says their problems are twofold: tas and health insurance.\u000A\u000A \u0022He gets paid every two weeks,\u0022 says Rebecca. \u0022For state and federal tas they take about $180. Then for health insurance they take about $375.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022The health costs go up every year,\u0022 says Dennis. \u0022And not just the regular  4 percent for inflation. It could be 10 percent, 17 percent...\u0022\u000A\u000A I ask them if they feel worse off than they did a few years ago. Rebecca says, \u0022Yes, a little. The cost of everything, like health insurance, gas, and groceries, has been going up by leaps and bounds. Some things have even seemed to double. Versus our income not changing that much.\u0022\u000A\u000A I tell them about the health system in my native UK—free health care for everyone. I say I remember Glenn Beck trying to scare America by saying that if ObamaCare went through, things would end up like Britain, with a savage, failing socialist health care system. \u0022But it\u0027s not failing,\u0022 I say. \u0022It\u0027s great. And nobody has to pay anything.\u0022 (Actually, it\u0027s funded by tas, and some parts of it work more efficiently than others, but you\u0027d be hard-pressed to find a Brit who doesn\u0027t feel proud of the system.)\u000A\u000A Dennis and Rebecca look at me warily, as if I might be pretending for some nefarious European socialist reason that the UK\u0027s National Health Service is a functional thing. But I\u0027m not a socialist, and it really is.\u000A\u000A The Pallwitzes have started seeking help at the local Food Pantry, a charity offering food to the needy. Rebecca says she was amazed that somewhere like Urbandale even needed a Food Pantry. But it does. And when she lines up, she doesn\u0027t see only derelicts. She sees middle-class families just like them.\u000A\u000A Dennis says he wishes they were better off, but there are positives about being poor. It makes people community-spirited, he says. Plus, money can turn a man wayward. He runs a church support group for sex and drug and alcohol addicts. Why did some of those men fall into a hedonistic abyss? \u0022Because they could afford to,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A This is a little heartbreaking to hear. It reminds me of Frantz. He rationalizes his place in America\u0027s economic ecosystem by saying it\u0027s manageable as long as people talk to him respectfully. Dennis rationalizes his position by saying that if he had more, who knows what pleasure-seeking temptations he might succumb to?\u000A\u000A And there\u0027s something else the Pallwitzes have in common with Frantz. They, too, say they leave the house only for work and church and to go to the park. They haven\u0027t been to the movies in a year.\u000A\u000A \u0022I hope you\u0027re not offended,\u0022 I say, \u0022but your lives seem unexpectedly similar to Frantz\u0027s.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m not surprised that we have the same struggles,\u0022 says Rebecca.\u000A\u000A \u0022How do you feel when you hear stories of the superrich getting away with paying hardly any tax?\u0022 I ask them.\u000A\u000A There\u0027s a short silence.\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027d probably do it, too, if I could,\u0022 Dennis shrugs. \u0022But I can\u0027t.\u0022 He pauses and shrugs. \u0022So.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHow to Live on $5,000 a Week\u000A\u000A Five times Dennis and Rebecca, there is me. I make about $250,000, double that in a good year—if, say, Hollywood is turning one of my books into a movie. Which doesn\u0027t happen often. Just the once, in fact (The Men Who Stare at Goats). Being a panicker, I live my life convinced poverty and disaster lie just around the corner unless I constantly and frantically work. Which I do.\u000A\u000A But I have none of Dennis and Rebecca\u0027s struggles. I can vacation anywhere. I haven\u0027t noticed rising gas and grocery prices other than hearing myself murmur a vague, \u0022Oh. That seems a bit more,\u0022 and then forgetting all about it. I have never felt so rich and so fortunate as I do when I drive away from Urbandale that morning. But the feeling doesn\u0027t last.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestNick Hanauer, Age: 52. The Seattle investor\u0027s taxable income is \u0022$10 million in a bad year.\u0022 He pays about 11 percent tax—but says he ought to pay nearly five times that.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHow to Live on $25,000 a Week\u000A\u000AA couple of weeks later, I meet the woman who makes five times more than me—$1.25 million in a bad year, up to $3 million in a great one. She wants to remain anonymous. I\u0027ll call her Ellen. She\u0027s a New York producer: movies, TV, Broadway. I meet her in London. She\u0027s over on business. She\u0027s brassy and loud and restless and alarmingly energetic and tough-looking, and she talks incredibly fast. She says it would be \u0022too weird and stressful\u0022 to reveal her name, given what she earns. If you\u0027re superrich or superpoor, everyone can see that. But in the top middle, one stays covert. Plus, she doesn\u0027t want letters begging for money. She once had one from her father, who is a \u0022pathetic gambler.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022How does it feel to make what you make?\u0022 I ask her.\u000A\u000A I notice a strange tone in my voice. The usual chirpy sense of inquiry isn\u0027t there. Instead I sound weirdly tense, as if the true reason for our meeting is for me to discover what I\u0027m missing out on.\u000A\u000A \u0022Good,\u0022 she says, nodding. \u0022Happiness is having 20 percent more than you imagine needing. The trick is not to be too rich.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Why not?\u0022 I ask her.\u000A\u000A \u0022People want to go on your private plane,\u0022 she says. \u0022You fall asleep in the middle of conference calls. There\u0027s a certain discombobulation when you have too much.\u0022\u000A\u000A Maybe Ellen\u0027s right. Maybe it would be bad to have your own plane. But for a second, Dennis flashes into my mind, with his own imagined perils of having more money. I remember that Karl Marx line about religion being the opium of the people—his idea that the elites keep the masses subdued with illusory visions of heaven. But Dennis and Ellen have both suggested to me, surely fallaciously, that greater fortune might lead to unexpected sadness. In America, it seems, one\u0027s economic standing can be its own kind of opium.\u000A\u000A Personally, I wish I were better at opiating myself. Instead I\u0027m sort of glaring at Ellen in a hostile manner, wondering how I might scramble up to her level.\u000A\u000A \u0022So what can and what can\u0027t you do in terms of luxury living?\u0022 I ask her.\u000A\u000A \u0022If you\u0027re really rich, you can buy your doctors,\u0022 she says. \u0022Mike Ovitz famously bought a couple of cardiac surgeons.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022You don\u0027t have anything like that, do you?\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A \u0022No, of course not,\u0022 says Ellen.\u000A\u000A Thank God, I think. Becoming aware of what\u0027s just out of your reach can be disconcerting. It\u0027s comforting to know that having my own doctors would be massively out of my reach.\u000A\u000A \u0022But I know a guy who knows a guy,\u0022 says Ellen. \u0022I\u0027m at a level where I don\u0027t have to suffer. I\u0027ve been sick. I had cancer. If you have money, you call the guy who knows the guy who\u0027s the head of the department. The truth is, rich people with cancer versus everyone else with cancer? Longer life! And I didn\u0027t think about bills at all! I have a bill? I throw it in the box. And that box goes to my business manager. This is a key item if you have money. You don\u0027t look at the bills. When I got money, I vowed, \u0027Never again will I suffer the small stuff.\u0027 To me paying a bill is the small stuff. \u0027I don\u0027t care how the fuck it happens; someone pay that fucking thing!\u0027 It\u0027s a good feeling.\u0022\u000A\u000A I listen and nod and think, I very much need a business manager. \u0022How much do you pay your business manager?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A \u0022A very small amount of money,\u0022 Ellen says, \u0022$100,000 a year.\u0022\u000A\u000A There\u0027s a silence. \u0022That\u0027s a lot,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A Ellen looks at me, surprised. \u0022No, it\u0027s not,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000A She explains that her business manager does many things for her: He runs her office, does her bookkeeping, oversees her investments, files her tas. And even though she pays him what can amount to nearly 10 percent of her income, she has some money in the bank, so she can afford him.\u000A\u000A Rarely has an interview awakened in me so many dormant desires. Before meeting Ellen, I had no idea I needed a business manager and a friend who knows top surgeons personally. I was a lot happier before this interview began.\u000A\u000A \u0022I still worry about bills,\u0022 I say sadly. \u0022And I get knots in my stomach when the tax is due. Really big knots. Have you worked out how to pay less tax like really rich people do?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022No,\u0022 Ellen replies. \u0022I pay 35 percent.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Good,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A",

what, compatriots? The gap between   the richest and the poorest among us is now wider than it has been since we all nose-dived into the   Great Depression. So GQ sent Jon Ronson on a journey into the secret financial lives of six different people on the ladder, from a guy washing dishes for 200 bucks a week in Miami to a self-storage gazillionaire. What he found are some surprising truths about class, money, and making it in America</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.0"><hr></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1"><h2>How to Live on $625,000 a Week</h2></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fbaf3655c24c6c954bb4/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-4-628.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-4-628.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-4-628.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-4-628.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaf3655c24c6c954bb4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-4-628.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-4-628.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaf3655c24c6c954bb4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-4-628.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-4-628.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>Wayne Hughes, Age: 78. Hughes, a Kentucky billionaire and horse breeder, says the debate over income inequality makes him feel like &quot;an enemy of the state.&quot;</p></span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.3">As I drive along the Pacific Coast Highway into Malibu, I catch glimpses of incredible cliff-top mansions discreetly obscured from the road, which is littered with abandoned gas stations and run-down mini-marts. The office building I pull up to is quite drab and utilitarian. There are no ornaments on the conference-room shelves&#x2014;just a bottle of hand sanitizer. An elderly, broad-shouldered man greets me. He&apos;s wearing jogging pants. They don&apos;t look expensive. His name is B. Wayne Hughes.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.5"> You almost definitely won&apos;t have heard of him. He hardly ever gives interviews. He only agreed to this one because&#x2014;as his people explained to me&#x2014;income disparity is a hugely important topic for him. They didn&apos;t explain <em>how</em> it was important, so I assumed he thought it was bad.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.6"> I approached Wayne, as he&apos;s known, for wholly mathematical reasons. I&apos;d worked out that there are six degrees of economic separation between a guy making ten bucks an hour and a <em>Forbes</em> billionaire, if you multiply each person&apos;s income by five. So I decided to journey across America to meet one representative of each multiple. By connecting these income brackets to actual people, I hoped to understand how money shapes their lives&#x2014;and the life of the country&#x2014;at a moment when the gap between rich and poor is such a combustible issue. Everyone in this story, then, makes roughly five times more than the last person makes. There&apos;s a dishwasher in Miami with an unbelievably stressful life, some nice middle-class Iowans with quite difficult lives, me with a perfectly fine if frequently anxiety-inducing life, a millionaire with an annoyingly happy life, a multimillionaire with a stunningly amazing life, and then, finally, at the summit, this great American eagle, Wayne, who tells me he&apos;s &quot;pissed off&quot; right now.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.7"> &quot;I live my life paying my tas and taking care of my responsibilities, and I&apos;m a little surprised to find out that I&apos;m an enemy of the state at this time in my life,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.8"> He has a big, booming voice like an old-school billionaire, not one of those nerdy new billionaires.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.9"> &quot;Has anyone said that to your face?&quot; I ask him.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.a"> &quot;Nobody has to,&quot; says Wayne. &quot;Just watch what they&apos;re doing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.b"> &quot;You mean the Occupy Wall Street crowd?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.c"> &quot;Those guys are a bunch of jerks,&quot; Wayne mutters, giving a dismissive wave that says, <em>They&apos;re just a sideshow.</em> &quot;Politically I&apos;m on the enemy list. I&apos;ve lived my whole life doing what I thought was right, and now I&apos;m an enemy of the state.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Is he, though? It&apos;s true that income inequality is a reliable applause line on the campaign trail. Here&apos;s Obama in a recent speech: &quot;What drags down our entire economy is when there&apos;s an ever widening chasm between the ultrarich and everybody else.&quot; Romney, meanwhile, likes to call this rhetoric &quot;the bitter politics of envy.&quot; As he told a receptive crowd in West Palm Beach, Florida, &quot;I believe in a merit nation, an opportunity nation, where people by virtue of their education and hard work and risk-taking and their dreams&#x2014;and maybe a little luck&#x2014;could achieve great things.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.e"> But the reality is that rarely are enemies of the state treated so well. Except for a brief stint in the late &apos;80s and early &apos;90s, their tax rate is at an eighty-year low. In the 1940s and 1950s, the top tax bracket paid more than 80 percent. It was 70 percent when Reagan took office, 40 percent under Clinton, and now, under Obama, it&apos;s 35 percent. But the very, very rich don&apos;t pay even that. By taking full advantage of an investor-friendly tax code, which takes a much smaller bite out of capital gains and dividends than it does for salaried income, the 400 richest Americans pay, on average, 18 percent tax.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.f"> Wayne won&apos;t reveal exactly what he pays now that he&apos;s at the top, but he&apos;s happy to tell me he began at the bottom.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.g"> &quot;Have you read <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em>?&quot; he asks. &quot;That was my family. My dad was a sharecropper in western Oklahoma. When the dust storms came and everything got wiped out, they came to California. The guys with the mattresses on the tops of their cars in the movie? That was the way it was.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.h"> They had nothing. His father got a job winding coils that went into refrigeration units. Wayne grew up in east Los Angeles, went to college, joined the navy, got married. For a while he worked for unglamorous-sounding businesses with names like the Frieden Corporation, but nothing stuck. He had a couple of children. He wasn&apos;t thriving. He had to do something.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.i"> And then, in 1972, he had an idea: People have too much stuff and nowhere to keep it. So he bought some land in San Diego and put up a building with 200 self-storage spaces. &quot;After that it was just building the units up, one at a time. For years and years. That&apos;s all. You don&apos;t get money unless you have a lot of talent, which I don&apos;t have, or you work hard, which is what I do. We don&apos;t have any golden touch here.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.j"> &quot;How many buildings have you got now?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.k"> &quot;Maybe 2,300,&quot; he says. &quot;With 500 or 600 units inside each.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.l"> Wayne says he never once stopped to contemplate the amount of money he was making. &quot;I was just looking at getting the best locations I could and getting the buildings opened and getting the tenants and getting the cash flow and on and on,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.m"> &quot;You never once thought, &apos;This money is cascading in. I am worth 4 BILLION DOLLARS&apos;?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.n"> He shakes his head. &quot;I don&apos;t spend any time at all thinking about my personal wealth. I suppose if I had nothing, I might think, &apos;I have nothing.&apos; But when we decided to go public and I saw how much money there was, I was very surprised.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.o"> In 2006, Wayne was America&apos;s sixty-first-richest man, according to <em>Forbes,</em> with $4.1 billion. Today he&apos;s the 242nd richest (and the 683rd richest in the world), with $1.9 billion. He&apos;s among  the least famous people on the list. In fact, he once asked the  magazine to remove his name. &quot;I said, &apos;It&apos;s an imposition. <em>Forbes</em> should not be doing that. It&apos;s the wrong thing to do. It puts my children and my grandchildren at risk.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.p"> &quot;And what did they say?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.q"> &quot;They said when Trump called up, he said the number next to his name was too small.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.r"> When Wayne is in Malibu, he stays in his daughter&apos;s spare room. His home is a three-bedroom farmhouse on a working stud farm in Lexington, Kentucky.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.s"> &quot;I have no fancy living at all,&quot; he says. &quot;Well, I have a house in Sun Valley. Five acres in the woods. I guess that&apos;s fancy.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.t"> I like Wayne very much. He&apos;s avuncular and salt of the earth. I admire how far he has risen from the <em>Grapes of Wrath</em> circumstances into which he was born; he&apos;s the very embodiment of the American Dream. I&apos;m surprised, though, and a little taken aback, by his anger. I&apos;ll return to Wayne&#x2014;and the curiously aggrieved way he views his place in the world&#x2014;a bit later.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.u"> But first let&apos;s plummet all the way down to the very, very bottom, as if we&apos;re falling down a well, to a concrete slab of a house in a downtrodden Miami neighborhood called Little Haiti.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.v"><hr></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.w"><h2>How to Live on $200 a Week</h2></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.x"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fbaf3655c24c6c954bb2/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-1-628.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-1-628.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-1-628.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-1-628.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaf3655c24c6c954bb2%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-1-628.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-1-628.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaf3655c24c6c954bb2%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-1-628.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-1-628.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>Maurose Frantz, Age: 26  Frantz says he has never even seen a customer or a menu at the steak house where he toils in the kitchen. &quot;If I get money,&quot; says the Haitian immigrant, &quot;I&apos;m going to leave.&quot;</p></span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.y">A young man peers into a crack of sunlight that emerges from behind one of the sheets that block out all his windows. His name is Maurose Frantz, but he goes by Frantz. He can&apos;t afford air-conditioning, hence the sheets, so it&apos;s very dark and stuffy in here. Frantz lives with five other people&#x2014;his mom, stepdad, grandparents, and little brother&#x2014;and the entire house is the size of a typical suburban living room. As it happens, the view down the dusty, potholed street includes not only used-car lots but also self-storage facilities&#x2014;the idea that made Wayne his billions.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.z"> &quot;Outside is dangerous,&quot; Frantz says. &quot;One time someone pulled up and said to me, &apos;Do you need a gun?&apos; He showed me a <em>gun!</em> I said, &apos;I can&apos;t hear you, man.&apos; Another time my grandpa&#x2014;they jumped him. They took his wallet. They slotted him. He cried, he cried, he cried.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.10"> Frantz is Haitian. His accent is very strong, and I&apos;m constantly asking him to repeat what he said: &quot;They did <em>what</em> to your grandpa? They slotted him? Slattered him? Sorry?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.11"> &quot;<em>Slapped</em> him,&quot; Frantz replies. <em>&quot;Slapped.&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.12"> Frantz washes dishes at the Capital Grille restaurant, a posh steak house near the harbor in Miami&apos;s financial district. He nets $200 for a twenty-seven-hour week and receives no food stamps or government assistance of any kind. That means he makes in an hour what I make in five minutes and Wayne makes pretty much every time he breathes in and out.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.13"> At the end of the week, Frantz gets an ATM card with his pay already loaded onto it. Sometimes when he clocks out at the end of the night, he says, he finds he&apos;s already been mysteriously clocked out by someone else. Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a restaurant workers&apos; advocacy group, launched a class-action suit against Darden&#x2014;the restaurant conglomerate that owns the Capital Grille&#x2014;for this and other alleged improprieties. Frantz says he&apos;s repeatedly requested some kind of paper breakdown of how many hours he&apos;s been paid for and how much tax has come off, but they never give it to him, so he&apos;s stopped asking. He&apos;s also stopped asking for a promotion to busboy. He says they told him they&apos;d let him know, but they never did. According to ROC United, the Capital Grille regularly denies promotions to dark-skinned people. It&apos;s possible for a black worker to become a busboy, Frantz says, but he&apos;s never seen a black server. Darden, for its part, maintains that the Capital Grille pays its employees fairly and that the claims of discrimination are baseless.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.14"> Last night, one of Frantz&apos;s co-workers threw away his shoes.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.15"> &quot;I checked everywhere,&quot; Frantz says. &quot;I checked in the garbage, but I couldn&apos;t find them. I called the sous-chef and I told him, &apos;I put down my shoes. Somebody threw them away.&apos; He said, &apos;Frantz, you know me. I&apos;m cool with you. I treat you like a man. I give you all the respect you need. I talk to you about your life.&apos; I said, &apos;I know, chef.&apos; He respects me, the sous-chef. He said, &apos;I don&apos;t know what happened to your shoes. I can&apos;t tell you nothing.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.16"> Frantz talks a lot about respect and the opposite of respect&#x2014;humiliation. It&apos;s as if he&apos;s lowered his ambitions to the level that he can take all sorts of awfulness as long as people talk to him with a little respect. It occurs to me that his life might be better if he spent less time worrying about feeling disrespected and more time actively working to improve his conditions, but then I realize he <em>is</em> doing all he can. Putting his head above the parapet to talk to me is a brave step. (ROC United asked for volunteers on my behalf, and he was the one to agree.) But I can&apos;t see how his life will improve anytime soon. He&apos;s so far down America&apos;s financial pecking order he barely registers on it.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.17"> I ask Frantz to show me his neighborhood. He says there&apos;s nothing really to see. He rarely goes out&#x2014;only to work and to church and to play soccer. Everywhere else is too dangerous. When we head outside, I scurry from his front door to the car. A smashed-up police cruiser lies abandoned on the corner. We take a drive  past the one place on earth he has some fun: the soccer field in  the public park.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.18"> Six miles later, we reach the Capital Grille. Usually he catches the bus, which takes an hour. When he works late and misses the 1 a.m. bus home, he has to stand there until the next one comes at 4 a.m.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.19"> &quot;Do you ever wonder what the customers&apos; lives are like?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> &quot;I don&apos;t know nothing about the customers,&quot; says Frantz. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen them.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> I look at him. &quot;You&apos;ve <em>never</em> seen a customer?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> &quot;Never,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> &quot;Do you know how much the steaks cost?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> &quot;I never saw a menu,&quot; he says. &quot;They&apos;re in the restaurant, not  the kitchen.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> His last words to me, before I head off to visit someone who makes five times what he does, are &quot;If I get money, I&apos;m going to leave.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><hr></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><h2>How to Live on $900 a Week</h2></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1i"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fbaf09f0bee56440c184/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-2-628.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-2-628.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-2-628.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-2-628.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaf09f0bee56440c184%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-2-628.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-2-628.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaf09f0bee56440c184%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-2-628.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-2-628.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>Dennis Pallwitz II,  Age: 39.

It&apos;s 7 a.m. and deserted and unseasonably chilly&#x2014;a tornado warning will be issued in a few hours&#x2014;but I&apos;m sure in warmer circumstances I&apos;d see children running around, in and out of one another&apos;s homes, and riding their bikes to school. The $900-a-week family who live here&#x2014;Dennis and Rebecca Pallwitz and their two toddlers&#x2014;have a ground-floor apartment in a tidy complex with a communal pool. Most of the properties here are detached family homes; theirs is an exception. I sit in their kitchen and tell them about Frantz.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1k"> &quot;Oh,&quot; gasps Rebecca sympathetically.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1l"> &quot;I know,&quot; I say. &quot;Imagine living in Miami and earning a fifth of what you earn. The stress must be unbelievable.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1m"> &quot;It&apos;s another world,&quot; says Rebecca.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1n"> The Pallwitzes&apos; fifth anniversary is approaching. &quot;We&apos;d like to go to the east of the state where we had our honeymoon,&quot; Dennis says. &quot;But&#x2014;&quot; he glances at Rebecca&#x2014;&quot;that would cost gas and food and a bed-and-breakfast stay, so maybe we&apos;ll stick around here, save the gas money, and get a hotel room for a couple of days.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1o"> &quot;You can&apos;t afford to drive across the <em>state?</em>&quot; I say in a startled screech. I sound like the Dowager Countess of Grantham from <em>Downton Abbey.</em> Speaking of which, last night in New York City, I got to see something Frantz has never seen: the inside of a Capital Grille restaurant. (I&apos;m guessing Dennis and Rebecca have never been to one, either.) There were stag heads and sculptures of horses and fine oil paintings of generic earls and lords and fox hunts. The milieu was very English country gentleman, although an English country gentleman would never put an <em>e</em> at the end of the word <em>grill.</em> It was delicious, and I didn&apos;t even think about what it cost. Almost every waiter was light-skinned, but I did see one dark-skinned man serving. So that was nice.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1p"> &quot;But there&apos;s lots of stuff to do here in the Des Moines area that we still haven&apos;t done,&quot; Dennis says, brightening. &quot;So...&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1q"> &quot;I know what I want to do,&quot; says Rebecca.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1r"> &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; says Dennis.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1s"> &quot;The drive-in movie theater and then the Incredible Pizza,&quot;  she says. &quot;The Incredible Pizza&apos;s got games and a buffet. You can pay $30, eat as much as you want, then play games until the money runs out. They have this tunnel thing going on. That doesn&apos;t  cost anything. Our son can take his shoes off and run in there   for a while....&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1t"> Dennis smiles, but I can tell he thinks Rebecca has evoked a crappy way to spend a fifth anniversary.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1u"> Dennis installs, maintains, and repairs &quot;a wide variety of home medical equipment, oxygen equipment, wheelchairs, a smattering of everything.&quot; Rebecca stays home with the children. She says their problems are twofold: tas and health insurance.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1v"> &quot;He gets paid every two weeks,&quot; says Rebecca. &quot;For state and federal tas they take about $180. Then for health insurance they take about $375.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1w"> &quot;The health costs go up every year,&quot; says Dennis. &quot;And not just the regular  4 percent for inflation. It could be 10 percent, 17 percent...&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1x"> I ask them if they feel worse off than they did a few years ago. Rebecca says, &quot;Yes, a little. The cost of everything, like health insurance, gas, and groceries, has been going up by leaps and bounds. Some things have even seemed to double. Versus our income not changing that much.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1y"> I tell them about the health system in my native UK&#x2014;free health care for everyone. I say I remember Glenn Beck trying to scare America by saying that if ObamaCare went through, things would end up like Britain, with a savage, failing socialist health care system. &quot;But it&apos;s not failing,&quot; I say. &quot;It&apos;s great. And nobody has to pay anything.&quot; (Actually, it&apos;s funded by tas, and some parts of it work more efficiently than others, but you&apos;d be hard-pressed to find a Brit who doesn&apos;t feel proud of the system.)</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.1z"> Dennis and Rebecca look at me warily, as if I might be pretending for some nefarious European socialist reason that the UK&apos;s National Health Service is a functional thing. But I&apos;m not a socialist, and it really is.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.20"> The Pallwitzes have started seeking help at the local Food Pantry, a charity offering food to the needy. Rebecca says she was amazed that somewhere like Urbandale even needed a Food Pantry. But it does. And when she lines up, she doesn&apos;t see only derelicts. She sees middle-class families just like them.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.21"> Dennis says he wishes they were better off, but there are positives about being poor. It makes people community-spirited, he says. Plus, money can turn a man wayward. He runs a church support group for sex and drug and alcohol addicts. Why did some of those men fall into a hedonistic abyss? &quot;Because they could afford to,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.22"> This is a little heartbreaking to hear. It reminds me of Frantz. He rationalizes his place in America&apos;s economic ecosystem by saying it&apos;s manageable as long as people talk to him respectfully. Dennis rationalizes his position by saying that if he had more, who knows what pleasure-seeking temptations he might succumb to?</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.23"> And there&apos;s something else the Pallwitzes have in common with Frantz. They, too, say they leave the house only for work and church and to go to the park. They haven&apos;t been to the movies in a year.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.24"> &quot;I hope you&apos;re not offended,&quot; I say, &quot;but your lives seem unexpectedly similar to Frantz&apos;s.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.25"> &quot;I&apos;m not surprised that we have the same struggles,&quot; says Rebecca.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.26"> &quot;How do you feel when you hear stories of the superrich getting away with paying hardly any tax?&quot; I ask them.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.27"> There&apos;s a short silence.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.28"> &quot;I&apos;d probably do it, too, if I could,&quot; Dennis shrugs. &quot;But I can&apos;t.&quot; He pauses and shrugs. &quot;So.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.29"><hr></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2a"><h2>How to Live on $5,000 a Week</h2></div><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2b"> Five times Dennis and Rebecca, there is me. I make about $250,000, double that in a good year&#x2014;if, say, Hollywood is turning one of my books into a movie. Which doesn&#x2019;t happen often. Just the once, in fact <em>(The Men Who Stare at Goats).</em> Being a panicker, I live my life convinced poverty and disaster lie just around the corner unless I constantly and frantically work. Which I do.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2c"> But I have none of Dennis and Rebecca&#x2019;s struggles. I can vacation anywhere. I haven&#x2019;t noticed rising gas and grocery prices other than hearing myself murmur a vague, &quot;Oh. That seems a bit more,&quot; and then forgetting all about it. I have never felt so rich and so fortunate as I do when I drive away from Urbandale that morning. But the feeling doesn&#x2019;t last.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2d"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2e"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fbaf3655c24c6c954bb8/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-3-628.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-3-628.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-3-628.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-3-628.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaf3655c24c6c954bb8%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-3-628.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-3-628.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Famber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaf3655c24c6c954bb8%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-3-628.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-07-amber-waves-amber-waves-3-628.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>Nick Hanauer, Age: 52.

She wants to remain anonymous. I&#x2019;ll call her Ellen. She&#x2019;s a New York producer: movies, TV, Broadway. I meet her in London. She&#x2019;s over on business. She&#x2019;s brassy and loud and restless and alarmingly energetic and tough-looking, and she talks incredibly fast. She says it would be &quot;too weird and stressful&quot; to reveal her name, given what she earns. If you&#x2019;re superrich or superpoor, everyone can see that. But in the top middle, one stays covert. Plus, she doesn&#x2019;t want letters begging for money. She once had one from her father, who is a &quot;pathetic gambler.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2i"> &quot;How does it feel to make what you make?&quot; I ask her.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2j"> I notice a strange tone in my voice. The usual chirpy sense of inquiry isn&#x2019;t there. Instead I sound weirdly tense, as if the true reason for our meeting is for me to discover what I&#x2019;m missing out on.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2k"> &quot;Good,&quot; she says, nodding. &quot;Happiness is having 20 percent more than you imagine needing. The trick is not to be <em>too</em> rich.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2l"> &quot;Why not?&quot; I ask her.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2m"> &quot;People want to go on your private plane,&quot; she says. &quot;You fall asleep in the middle of conference calls. There&#x2019;s a certain discombobulation when you have too much.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2n"> Maybe Ellen&#x2019;s right. Maybe it would be bad to have your own plane. But for a second, Dennis flashes into my mind, with his own imagined perils of having more money. I remember that Karl Marx line about religion being the opium of the people&#x2014;his idea that the elites keep the masses subdued with illusory visions of heaven. But Dennis and Ellen have both suggested to me, surely fallaciously, that greater fortune might lead to unexpected sadness. In America, it seems, one&#x2019;s economic standing can be its own kind of opium.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2o"> Personally, I wish I were better at opiating myself. Instead I&#x2019;m sort of glaring at Ellen in a hostile manner, wondering how I might scramble up to her level.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2p"> &quot;So what can and what can&#x2019;t you do in terms of luxury living?&quot; I ask her.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2q"> &quot;If you&#x2019;re really rich, you can buy your doctors,&quot; she says. &quot;Mike Ovitz famously bought a couple of cardiac surgeons.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2r"> &quot;You don&#x2019;t have anything like <em>that,</em> do you?&quot; I say.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2s"> &quot;No, of course not,&quot; says Ellen.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2t"> Thank God, I think. Becoming aware of what&#x2019;s just out of your reach can be disconcerting. It&#x2019;s comforting to know that having my own doctors would be <em>massively</em> out of my reach.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2u"> &quot;But I know a guy who knows a guy,&quot; says Ellen. &quot;I&#x2019;m at a level where I don&#x2019;t have to suffer. I&#x2019;ve been sick. I had cancer. If you have money, you call the guy who knows the guy who&#x2019;s the head of the department. The truth is, rich people with cancer versus everyone else with cancer? Longer life! And I didn&#x2019;t think about bills at all! I have a bill? I throw it in the box. And that box goes to my business manager. This is a key item if you have money. You don&#x2019;t look at the bills. When I got money, I vowed, &#x2019;Never again will I suffer the small stuff.&#x2019; To me paying a bill is the small stuff. &#x2019;I don&#x2019;t care how the fuck it happens; someone pay that fucking thing!&#x2019; It&#x2019;s a good feeling.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2v"> I listen and nod and think, I very much need a business manager. &quot;How much do you pay your business manager?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2w"> &quot;A very small amount of money,&quot; Ellen says, &quot;$100,000 a year.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2x"> There&#x2019;s a silence. &quot;That&#x2019;s a lot,&quot; I say.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2y"> Ellen looks at me, surprised. &quot;No, it&#x2019;s not,&quot; she says.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.2z"> She explains that her business manager does many things for her: He runs her office, does her bookkeeping, oversees her investments, files her tas. And even though she pays him what can amount to nearly 10 percent of her income, she has some money in the bank, so she can afford him.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.30"> Rarely has an interview awakened in me so many dormant desires. Before meeting Ellen, I had no idea I needed a business manager and a friend who knows top surgeons personally. I was a lot happier before this interview began.</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.31"> &quot;I still worry about bills,&quot; I say sadly. &quot;And I get knots in my stomach when the tax is due. Really big knots. Have you worked out how to pay less tax like really rich people do?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.32"> &quot;No,&quot; Ellen replies. &quot;I pay 35 percent.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.33"> &quot;Good,&quot; I say.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".5w5n5sx0cg.1.1.0.0.4.34"><hr></div><div class="embed cnevideo"
