<p> As with all Sixpoint brews, this one defies strict categorization: Diesel is part black IPA (dry, with big, upfront hop bitterness) and part American stout (roasty, semisweet malts with some slight caramel and vanilla). It&#39;s got just a hint of creaminess to keep it smooth and rich, but the inky black pour and full-on hops help it live up to its name. At 69 IBUs (international bitterness units), it&#39;s got a kick you wouldn&#39;t expect from your average stout, which makes it a perfect for setting you apart from the uninspired masses.</p></div><cite data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.0.2.0.0.0.5.0.3.1">Photo: sixpoint.com</cite></div></div></div></main></div><div class="col col-md-6" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1"><aside class="slideshow-aside" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0"><div class="component-counter" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter"><div class="counter" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0"><span class="current" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.0">1</span><span class="divider" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.1">of</span><span class="total" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.$slideshow-counter.0.2">5</span></div></div><span class="component-toggle toggle-thumbnails" aria-label="Toggle Button" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.3">Toggle Thumbnails</span><div class="gqGalleryBox displayAd displayAd300x250 displayAd300x250Js gallery-aside-ad not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBox300x250_frame" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.0.2.0.1.0.4:0"></div></aside></div></div></div></div><div class="gallery-bottom-container" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.1"><div class="col col-md-14 gallery-bottom-pane" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.1.0"><div class="gqGalleryBan displayAd displayAd728x90 displayAd728x90Js gq-gallery-banner not-fetched hidden" id="gqGalleryBan728x90_frame" data-reactid=".9u7ruf5hq8.1:3.0.1.0.0"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
