  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022So I\u0027m working on this story about wearables,\u0022 I tell my friend.\u000A\u000A\u0022Werewolves?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Wearables.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh,\u0022 he says, disappointed. Which, screw him for raising expectations like that. But I understand the tepid response. For those living under a rock without a broadband connection, a wearable, at its most basic, is technology you can wear (duh) that delivers on one of two promises: to give you more information about yourself or to ease the flow of information coming in.\u000A\u000AThe term is horrible, probably invented by the guy who turned \u0022creative\u0022 into a noun. But as a buzzword, \u0022wearables\u0022 is buzzing louder than ever as tech companies grope for the Next Big Thing.\u000A\u000AYou can\u0027t swing an HDMI cable in a Best Buy without hitting a stack of activity-tracking wristbands. And in just the past year, Samsung has flooded the market with five smartwatches (as in three more than the number of wrists you have), all designed to mimic your smartphone\u0027s basic functions. As with all of its groundbreaking product introductions, Apple announced the coming of its smartwatch months before you can buy it (arrival date: a vague \u0022early 2015\u0022) to stoke desire and mess with the competition. Fashion designers like Ralph Lauren (workout-tracking shirt, out this spring) and Michael Bastian (smartwatch) are in the mix. Factor in start-ups pushing wearables for your dog, your baby, and your dick and you\u0027ll understand why I\u0027ve written this pamphlet on the global Illuminati conspiracy to turn humanity into cyborg slaves.\u000A\u000AI kid about the enslaved-humans thing. But I\u0027m serious about my skepticism. I suffer from a modern existential angst: I love new gadgets, and I also worry that my life\u0027s being overrun—or maybe just straight-up run—by technology. Perhaps you know the feeling. It\u0027s why I\u0027m not currently wearing any wearables. It\u0027s also why I can\u0027t wait to start.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022Smartwatch\u0022 Is a Strong Word\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s fair to ask, with our pockets already home to supercomputers, what exactly wearables will do for us. According to Astro Teller, the answer is \u0022almost everything\u0022—or at least they will eventually. Teller is a man of humbling intellect, which is why he\u0027s also director of Google[x], a Murderers\u0027 Row of geniuses helping the future arrive as fast as possible. From their fertile brain-loins have sprung such technologies as autonomous cars and balloons that deliver Internet, along with wearables like a contact lens able to measure the glucose of diabetics, and, yes, Google Glass.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022Wearables will find all sorts of ways to mediate your physical experience,\u0022 he says, meaning they will become the layer between what you hear and see—maybe even touch or smell or taste—and what your brain perceives. Picture Google Glass 27-dot-oh displaying tasting notes on the wine menu you\u0027re perusing, then logging the calories of the 2027 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Grand Cru you splurge on. It\u0027s a hypothetical that sounds magical and scary. It\u0027s also a giant leap forward from this smartwatch on my wrist.\u000A\u000AThe smartwatch is the wearable du jour, a sidekick device that gives you a new way to dip into your data stream without touching the metal-and-glass monolith in your pocket. I\u0027ve worn a few (though not Apple\u0027s, because they\u0027re more secretive than the CIA), and I get the allure.\u000A\u000AI developed a routine: I\u0027d put the watch on when I got to work and take it off when I left. Being able to quickly see whether a text or an e-mail is ignorable versus three-alarm urgent with a glance at my wrist helped keep me focused at work. Sometimes I\u0027d use a smartwatch\u0027s voice control to reply, but because the dictation is so spazzy, I\u0027d have to keep things short and simple—no long-winded explanations or needless \u0022Thanks!\u0022 You could say that I like smartwatches because they\u0027re kinda dumb.\u000A\u000AYou could also say that most every smartwatch feels like a beta unit, glitchy and unintuitive. The screens are, by and large, obnoxiously bright. Each text, e-mail, and weather update is a wrist-mounted Bat Signal letting everyone know that you\u0027re the dude with the magic watch.\u000A\u000ADespite how dorky most of them look, there\u0027s reason to think that might change soon. The Chronowing smartwatch that HP and menswear designer Michael Bastian debuted this past fall felt a little half-baked on the functionality but looked—crazily enough—like a real watch. And recently, Humberto Leon and Carol Lim of Opening Ceremony teamed with Intel to develop a women\u0027s bangle-slash-smartwatch called MICA. Leon told me that he and Lim blew engineers\u0027 minds with a simple idea: \u0022We said, \u0027What if we don\u0027t want people to notice she\u0027s wearing a wearable?\u0027 \u0022 Dear tech companies: Listen to this man.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000APress \u0022Start\u0022 for Inner Peace\u000A\u000AActivity trackers— you know, Fitbits and the like—went from mind-blowing to mundane at warp speed. I\u0027ve always felt they deliver numbers for numbers\u0027 sake, confusing stats for useful intel that might get me to change my ways. But they\u0027re showing signs of making that leap toward Teller\u0027s great wearable future. Just ask Monica Rogati, Jawbone\u0027s VP of Data.\u000A\u000ARogati knows that delivering fitness insight, not just useless trivia, requires both more information and a squad of humans with actuarial tables for brains who can parse it into something useful. That\u0027s where she and her data-loving team come in. Relying on hundreds of thousands of Jawbone users sharing data with the company, she\u0027s quantified the effect of losing an hour of sleep on how many fewer steps users take the next day. She\u0027s seen how women average twenty more minutes of sleep per night than men—and she\u0027s used her vast data pool to drill down further. \u0022Is it different if people live in cities or in the country? In China or in the U.S.?\u0022 asks Rogati—and she could easily find out.\u000A\u000AThe first wave of activity trackers have been basic: centered around steps, a borderline-useless metric, and sleep, which they couldn\u0027t measure particularly accurately. But the hardware is improving. The just-released Jawbone UP3 claims to track heart rate and skin temperature—and after promised updates, hydration. It should be able to tell the difference between light, deep, and REM sleep. Which means Rogati and her crew will be able to connect more dots and invest that insight in the feedback the Jawbone app gives us.\u000A\u000AAnd I admit, I\u0027m intrigued. I\u0027ve bailed on every activity tracker I\u0027ve ever tested. Counting steps makes me feel like a suburban mom in ankle weights fast-walking the mall. A smarter activity tracker paired with smarter people behind the scenes crunching numbers might actually help me shed the extra fifteen pounds I\u0027ve carried since college. But in the meantime, I have grander ambitions: inner peace.\u000A\u000AOf all the products I tested, I\u0027m most hooked on the InteraXon Muse, an EEG device that teaches us non-Buddhists to attain focused serenity, all for the low, low price of $299, plus shipping and handling. It\u0027s a semicircle of rubber and plastic that spans my forehead and hooks over my ears, making me look like a caveman trying on headphones. Pressed to my skin are seven sensors, each measuring my brain waves, which are wirelessly beamed to my iPad, interpreted by an app, and then transmogrified into a soundscape (delivered via headphones) that changes depending on how well I keep my brain engaged.\u000A\u000ABasically, Muse\u0027s app wants me to meditate. I\u0027m supposed to focus intently on my breathing, and nothing else. But things veer from transcendental to techy: While meditating I hear a virtual tide gently lapping at my virtual feet. If my brain wanders, howling wind kicks up. And if I somehow, miraculously, think myself into a prolonged period of focus, a tiny little bird lands nearby and sings its heart out. Except that bird has only dropped by once, on my first go-round; right now I\u0027m birdless and psyched out. I want that winged validation so badly that the instant I hear peaceful lapping, I think THIS IS IT. BIRD TIME. At which point the app goes all Perfect Storm. I haven\u0027t heard the bird in a week now, but I\u0027m getting better at finding my peaceful place with every try. Ironically, the wearable I love most is the one designed to free me from the effects of technology. Muse has made meditation into a game, and I am going to win the hell out of it.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Future Is Now(-ish)!\u000A\u000AWearables, right now, are hitting puberty. They\u0027re gawky and zitty and trip over themselves, but if you look hard enough, you can glimpse what they\u0027ll be when they grow up. Unless you\u0027re Astro Teller, who knows exactly where wearables are headed. \u0022They will become our interaction with the world,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000ATeller speaks grandiosely about the ambitions of Google Glass, a type of product he firmly believes will inevitably become ubiquitous. From the vantage of pure robot logic, mounting the controls and the screen on your head makes too much sense. Texts and e-mails float in front of your face; replying—or searching, or taking a photo—only takes a few words, not a tug from your jeans pocket and a flurry of taps. \u0022Glass aspires to merging your digital self and your physical self so you can just live your life,\u0022 he says. It\u0027s an idyllic concept that makes my techno-angst flare up, what with its tautological belief that we can eradicate the stresses and demands of technology with more technology.\u000A\u000AThen Teller starts prognosticating, and I find myself nodding in awe and wonder. \u0022We will wear things to express to the world who we are and what we need,\u0022 he says. He gives an example of walking up to an espresso machine that automatically knows, thanks to your body-monitoring wearable, how much to pour to keep your brain revved up. Then he gets into the hard stuff: cyborg upgrades. \u0022There\u0027s a lot of evidence that you can create a tiny bit of heat against the back of your hand and train people to unconsciously have a perfect sense of direction—you can\u0027t tell why you know which way is north, but you\u0027ll know,\u0022 he says. \u0022Technology can give your body this new capability.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhich raises the yeah-but question: Is that a good thing? It\u0027s easy to let your brain veer toward some dystopian future, especially considering the uneasy relationship we already have with the time-suck smartphones in our pockets. But maybe it\u0027ll be amazing. The way Teller sees it, wearables mean we stop being aware of technology and start letting it flow through our lives seamlessly. We\u0027ll be jacked into the mainframe, with ScarJo\u0027s disembodied lips purring whatever information we need into our ears the moment we need it. If that\u0027s the case—if wearables really can become the un-technology, freeing us up to experience the world instead of burying our faces in screens? Then I\u0027ll be the 60-year-old waiting in line to get my HandCompass mod, telling all the young punks around me about how much navigation on the first smartwatches suuuuuucked.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Put an Activity Tracker on It!\u000A\u000A First they came for our wrists, and we said nothing. Then they came for our dongs.—J.W.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ATrack Your Foot!\u000A\u000ASensoria\u0027s Fitness Socks ($199) not only log steps and speed but can actually give you feedback on your running form—say, if you pronate too much or you run like an ostrich.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ATrack Your Dog!\u000A\u000AStrap Whistle ($99) onto Fido\u0027s collar and it\u0027ll send updates to your phone that let you know how active he is, how often he walks, and when he\u0027s resting. Alternatively, you can look down.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ATrack Your Baby!\u000A\u000AThe $299 Sproutling swears it can track sleep, predict when your infant will wake up, and even guess at what kind of mood he\u0027ll be in when he does. (Hint: boob-hungry.)\u000A\u000ATrack Your Dick!\u000A\u000AWhat good is having a boner if you can\u0027t quantify its power, bro? The Bondara Seit (out late 2015) is a cock ring able to tally your thrusts per minute, which will totally impress her, man.\u000A\u000AJon Wilde is a GQ articles editor",

Which, screw him for raising expectations like that. But I understand the tepid response. For those living under a rock without a broadband connection, a wearable, at its most basic, is technology you can wear (duh) that delivers on one of two promises: to give you more information about yourself or to ease the flow of information coming in.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.6">The term is horrible, probably invented by the guy who turned &quot;creative&quot; into a noun.

And in just the past year, Samsung has flooded the market with five smartwatches (as in three more than the number of wrists you have), all designed to mimic your smartphone&#x2019;s basic functions. As with all of its groundbreaking product introductions, Apple announced the coming of its smartwatch months before you can buy it (arrival date: a vague &quot;early 2015&quot;) to stoke desire and mess with the competition. Fashion designers like Ralph Lauren (workout-tracking shirt, out this spring) and Michael Bastian (smartwatch) are in the mix. Factor in start-ups pushing wearables for your dog, your baby, and your dick and you&#x2019;ll understand why I&#x2019;ve written this pamphlet on the global Illuminati conspiracy to turn humanity into cyborg slaves.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.8">I kid about the enslaved-humans thing. But I&#x2019;m serious about my skepticism. I suffer from a modern existential angst: I love new gadgets, and I also worry that my life&#x2019;s being overrun&#x2014;or maybe just straight-up run&#x2014;by technology. Perhaps you know the feeling. It&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m not currently wearing any wearables.

Picture Google Glass 27-dot-oh displaying tasting notes on the wine menu you&#x2019;re perusing, then logging the calories of the 2027 Domaine de la Roman&#xE9;e-Conti Grand Cru you splurge on. It&#x2019;s a hypothetical that sounds magical and scary. It&#x2019;s also a giant leap forward from this smartwatch on my wrist.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.e">The smartwatch is the wearable du jour, a sidekick device that gives you a new way to dip into your data stream without touching the metal-and-glass monolith in your pocket. I&#x2019;ve worn a few (though not Apple&#x2019;s, because they&#x2019;re more secretive than the CIA), and I get the allure.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.f">I developed a routine: I&#x2019;d put the watch on when I got to work and take it off when I left. Being able to quickly see whether a text or an e-mail is ignorable versus three-alarm urgent with a glance at my wrist helped keep me focused at work. Sometimes I&#x2019;d use a smartwatch&#x2019;s voice control to reply, but because the dictation is so spazzy, I&#x2019;d have to keep things short and simple&#x2014;no long-winded explanations or needless &quot;Thanks!&quot; You could say that I like smartwatches because they&#x2019;re kinda dumb.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.g">You could also say that most every smartwatch feels like a beta unit, glitchy and unintuitive. The screens are, by and large, obnoxiously bright. Each text, e-mail, and weather update is a wrist-mounted Bat Signal letting everyone know that you&#x2019;re the dude with the magic watch.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.h">Despite how dorky most of them look, there&#x2019;s reason to think that might change soon. The Chronowing smartwatch that HP and menswear designer Michael Bastian debuted this past fall felt a little half-baked on the functionality but looked&#x2014;crazily enough&#x2014;like a real watch. And recently, Humberto Leon and Carol Lim of Opening Ceremony teamed with Intel to develop a women&#x2019;s bangle-slash-smartwatch called MICA. Leon told me that he and Lim blew engineers&#x2019; minds with a simple idea: &quot;We said, &#x2019;What if we don&#x2019;t want people to notice she&#x2019;s wearing a wearable?&#x2019; &quot; Dear tech companies: Listen to this man.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.i"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>Press &quot;Start&quot; for Inner Peace</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Activity trackers&#x2014;</strong> you know, Fitbits and the like&#x2014;went from mind-blowing to mundane at warp speed. I&#x2019;ve always felt they deliver numbers for numbers&#x2019; sake, confusing stats for useful intel that might get me to change my ways. But they&#x2019;re showing signs of making that leap toward Teller&#x2019;s great wearable future. Just ask Monica Rogati, Jawbone&#x2019;s VP of Data.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.l">Rogati knows that delivering fitness insight, not just useless trivia, requires both more information and a squad of humans with actuarial tables for brains who can parse it into something useful. That&#x2019;s where she and her data-loving team come in. Relying on hundreds of thousands of Jawbone users sharing data with the company, she&#x2019;s quantified the effect of losing an hour of sleep on how many fewer steps users take the next day. She&#x2019;s seen how women average twenty more minutes of sleep per night than men&#x2014;and she&#x2019;s used her vast data pool to drill down further. &quot;Is it different if people live in cities or in the country? In China or in the U.S.?&quot; asks Rogati&#x2014;and she could easily find out.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.m">The first wave of activity trackers have been basic: centered around steps, a borderline-useless metric, and sleep, which they couldn&#x2019;t measure particularly accurately. But the hardware is improving. The just-released Jawbone UP3 claims to track heart rate and skin temperature&#x2014;and after promised updates, hydration. It should be able to tell the difference between light, deep, and REM sleep. Which means Rogati and her crew will be able to connect more dots and invest that insight in the feedback the Jawbone app gives us.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.n">And I admit, I&#x2019;m intrigued. I&#x2019;ve bailed on every activity tracker I&#x2019;ve ever tested. Counting steps makes me feel like a suburban mom in ankle weights fast-walking the mall. A smarter activity tracker paired with smarter people behind the scenes crunching numbers might actually help me shed the extra fifteen pounds I&#x2019;ve carried since college. But in the meantime, I have grander ambitions: inner peace.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.o">Of all the products I tested, I&#x2019;m most hooked on the InteraXon Muse, an EEG device that teaches us non-Buddhists to attain focused serenity, all for the low, low price of $299, plus shipping and handling. It&#x2019;s a semicircle of rubber and plastic that spans my forehead and hooks over my ears, making me look like a caveman trying on headphones. Pressed to my skin are seven sensors, each measuring my brain waves, which are wirelessly beamed to my iPad, interpreted by an app, and then transmogrified into a soundscape (delivered via headphones) that changes depending on how well I keep my brain engaged.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.p">Basically, Muse&#x2019;s app wants me to meditate. I&#x2019;m supposed to focus intently on my breathing, and nothing else. But things veer from transcendental to techy: While meditating I hear a virtual tide gently lapping at my virtual feet. If my brain wanders, howling wind kicks up. And if I somehow, miraculously, think myself into a prolonged period of focus, a tiny little bird lands nearby and sings its heart out. Except that bird has only dropped by once, on my first go-round; right now I&#x2019;m birdless and psyched out. I want that winged validation so badly that the instant I hear peaceful lapping, I think THIS IS IT. BIRD TIME. At which point the app goes all Perfect Storm. I haven&#x2019;t heard the bird in a week now, but I&#x2019;m getting better at finding my peaceful place with every try. Ironically, the wearable I love most is the one designed to free me from the effects of technology. Muse has made meditation into a game, and I am going to win the hell out of it.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.q"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>The Future Is Now(-ish)!</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>Wearables, right now,</strong> are hitting puberty. They&#x2019;re gawky and zitty and trip over themselves, but if you look hard enough, you can glimpse what they&#x2019;ll be when they grow up. Unless you&#x2019;re Astro Teller, who knows exactly where wearables are headed. &quot;They will become our interaction with the world,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.t">Teller speaks grandiosely about the ambitions of Google Glass, a type of product he firmly believes will inevitably become ubiquitous. From the vantage of pure robot logic, mounting the controls and the screen on your head makes too much sense. Texts and e-mails float in front of your face; replying&#x2014;or searching, or taking a photo&#x2014;only takes a few words, not a tug from your jeans pocket and a flurry of taps. &quot;Glass aspires to merging your digital self and your physical self so you can just live your life,&quot; he says. It&#x2019;s an idyllic concept that makes my techno-angst flare up, what with its tautological belief that we can eradicate the stresses and demands of technology with more technology.</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.u">Then Teller starts prognosticating, and I find myself nodding in awe and wonder. &quot;We will wear things to express to the world who we are and what we need,&quot; he says. He gives an example of walking up to an espresso machine that automatically knows, thanks to your body-monitoring wearable, how much to pour to keep your brain revved up. Then he gets into the hard stuff: cyborg upgrades. &quot;There&#x2019;s a lot of evidence that you can create a tiny bit of heat against the back of your hand and train people to unconsciously have a perfect sense of direction&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t tell why you know which way is north, but you&#x2019;ll <em>know,</em>&quot; he says. &quot;Technology can give your body this new capability.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2714u1qo2dc.1.1.0.0.4.v">Which raises the yeah-but question: Is that a good thing? It&#x2019;s easy to let your brain veer toward some dystopian future, especially considering the uneasy relationship we already have with the time-suck smartphones in our pockets. But maybe it&#x2019;ll be amazing. The way Teller sees it, wearables mean we stop being aware of technology and start letting it flow through our lives seamlessly.
