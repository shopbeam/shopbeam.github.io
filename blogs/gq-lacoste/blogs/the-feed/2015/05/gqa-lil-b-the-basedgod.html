  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000APhoto: Getty Images\u000A\u000ALil B, who for the past half-decade has been an arbiter of spacey, discombobulated cool, sounds a little flustered. Originally I got in touch with the BasedGod in hopes of soliciting some sagely life advice for new college graduates. But with the frenzy of the NBA Western Conference Finals winding to a close, the Berkeley rapper (and Warriors fan!) has once again reared his beautiful shining face in the news cycle, and is currently on a mini media blitz, thanks, in part, to supposedly supernatural ties to Houston Rockets beard-o James Harden (who may or may not have illicitly borrowed the BasedGod\u0027s cooking dance).\u000A\u000AGQ managed to catch up with Lil B shortly after he ducked into a CVS to buy a charger for his phone, which was running out of battery.\u000A\u000AIs your phone charged? Where are you at? \u000A\u000ARight now I\u0027m just hanging out in the Bay Area.\u000A\u000AOne of the editors here included your GQ Magazine track in a work email the other day.\u000A\u000AI love it. GQ Magazine, strapped with the magazine! We \u0027bout to get it big with that first cover. Shouts out to A$AP Rocky, I seen you getting that love on that GQ. That\u0027s a big look, man. Lil B, coming up next.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AI heard you\u0027re going to the Warriors-Rockets game on Wednesday. Do you know where you\u0027re sitting yet?\u000A\u000AI gotta still figure that out! I wanna be with my folks, you know what I\u0027m saying? Somewhere close behind these players. A ticket costs enough! [Laughs]\u000A\u000AAre you gonna be tweeting?\u000A\u000ADefinitely, if I feel it\u0027s necessary. Other than that I just keep everything pretty authentic. Say what I feel.\u000A\u000ACan I ask you for a small favor? Can you do like a reverse-curse on Steph Curry to make sure he doesn\u0027t get hurt?\u000A\u000AYeah, you know, that curse stuff, that\u0027s really up to the BasedGod. Me as Lil B, I do know the BasedGod. But all that, it\u0027s really up to him. I just try to stay positive and keep it loving, you know what I mean?\u000A\u000AHas James Harden or his camp reached out to you at all about the cooking dance stuff?\u000A\u000ANah, nah. The problem with them is that, they definitely do that silent treatment stuff. He learned a lot from Kevin Durant, you know?\u000A\u000AWhat about the Warriors? Do they show you love?\u000A\u000AI get a lot of support from the Warriors organization. The Oracle Arena. A lot of the Warriors follow me. Shouts out to Klay Thompson. Marreese Speights. These are just a few I can think of off the top of my head. It\u0027s all love.\u000A\u000AI remember a few years ago you challenged Kevin Durant to a game of one-on-one. Is there anyone on this year\u0027s Dubs team whose game most closely resembles yours?\u000A\u000ARight now I really don\u0027t know. I\u0027m working on my fundamentals. I\u0027m a really good defensive player. I\u0027ve been working on my defensive stance. Defensive stance, fosho! You know, just working on getting things together. Getting that consistent shot.\u000A\u000AAre you trying to pattern your shot more after Steph or Klay?\u000A\u000AI wish my shot was like that! Right now, I have my own unique shot. I\u0027m really stronger going to the hole on the drive. I\u0027m more of a defensive shooting guard. Yeah, that\u0027s kind of the way I play.\u000A\u000AWhat would you do if the Warriors won the title this year?\u000A\u000AI\u0027m just gonna be extremely, eternally happy. It\u0027s gonna be great motivation to see your local team doing great things and bringing inspiration. And bringing things to new heights and levels. I\u0027m definitely just excited about life. And life is really good right now.\u000A\u000AI want everybody to know that they\u0027re great. I love GQ.\u000A\u000ALet\u0027s change gears a bit and talk about your fans who are graduating from college right now. I think I read somewhere that you were a women\u0027s study major. Is that true?\u000A\u000ASometimes these internet things... they\u0027ll say some pretty cool stuff about me. But that\u0027s not true. No women\u0027s studies, but I get the people that think that way. [Laughs] Definitely interested in getting an associates degree soon and trying to continue to learn, you know what I mean? Really excited to keep learning.\u000A\u000AWhat advice would you give to new college grads, the kinds of kids who maybe used Lil B quotes in their yearbooks?\u000A\u000AReally just.... [there\u0027s a call on the other line] damn, this is CBS calling me. What I would say to them is that just continue to stay positive, figure out their passionâ€”what they would love to do for free without any money. See how far that can go, but really just getting together with people. Get the support of other people. People make things happen.\u000A\u000ADo you think it\u0027s realistic that everyone should figure out what they\u0027re passionate about, and pursue that?\u000A\u000AYeah, definitely. [And here, he sounds distracted.] Definitely.\u000A\u000AIf you weren\u0027t a rapper/author/internet human, what do you think you would be doing career-wise?\u000A\u000AI\u0027m not too sure. Maybe neurosurgeon. Something in the health field. Biology, dealing with the earth. The animals. It would most likely be some kind of doctor. Neuroscience, neurosurgeon. I always wanted to do that, ever since I was young. Before rap!\u000A\u000ABut it\u0027s never too late to go back and study that. [I could still] be that neurosurgeon that I really wanna be. I\u0027d probably be the first to do it if I just stick to it.\u000A\u000ASo some of these kids who spent their teens listening to you...\u000A\u000AHey bruh. Brother, can you actually hold on real fast? On the other line is CBS and they keep blowing me up. It\u0027s a live radio show. Can you hold on one second?\u000A\u000AOh, sure.\u000A\u000A[Holds for not even 3 minutes]\u000A\u000AHey bruh! Sorry about that. That was a live radio show! Quickest possible thing. Now we back to it! Now I can give you that focus!\u000A\u000ASo these new grads! What advice would you give them for the job hunt?\u000A\u000AFirst they gotta realize how beautiful they are. They are amazing. They are survivors because they are alive.\u000A\u000AThat means they\u0027re special regardless of any of the pain, or any of the second guessing we go through as humans. The first thing is realize you\u0027re beautiful, inside out. And we\u0027re not just talking about looks. We\u0027re talking about personality, thinkingâ€”just being a great overall person. Know you\u0027re a great person.\u000A\u000AThe second thing is, know that every day will not be the same forever. There might be something that\u0027s going on that\u0027s weird right now. But you\u0027ll be finding your job soon. You\u0027ll be finding what you need to find out about real soon.\u000A\u000ALet the earth send you blessings, you know? Get support from people. Build your community. Build your friends. Get some solid friends. Believe in each other. Try something new. Because that will go to the next step. Everything is always about going to the next step. And you don\u0027t have to step on people\u0027s toes to get there.\u000A\u000AIt doesn\u0027t have to be about capital. It doesn\u0027t have to be about you making money to get to the next place. Things can be done out of love.\u000A\u000AAnd you can make a living off love.\u000A\u000AI hear a lot of people who say, \u0022Love doesn\u0027t pay the bills.\u0022 Yes they do. It pays mine!\u000A\u000AOff the top of your head, what Lil B tracks would you recommend to someone who might be bummed by the job hunt?\u000A\u000AWe got um, okay. You could play Lil B \u0022Foolin Around.\u0022 That\u0027s one.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ALet\u0027s do Lil B... play that \u0022Rain in England\u0022 produced by the BasedGod, ecutive produced by Lil B, produced and composed by the BasedGod. Listen to that thoroughly and in full.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAnd put on \u0022Choices and Flowers\u0022 by the BaseGod, produced and composed by the BasedGod, ecutive produced by Lil B.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s no rapping on that one. Check that out. Get your mind right. It\u0027s a beautiful life.\u000A\u000AThis interview has been edited and condensed.",

Images</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.2">Lil B, who for the past half-decade has been an arbiter of spacey, discombobulated cool, sounds a little flustered. Originally I got in touch with the BasedGod in hopes of soliciting some sagely life advice for new college graduates. But with the frenzy of the NBA Western Conference Finals winding to a close, the Berkeley rapper (and Warriors fan!) has once again reared his beautiful shining face in the news cycle, and is currently on a mini media blitz, thanks, in part, to <a href="we-dont-usually-believe-in-curses-but-it-is-probably-a-unwise-to-anger-lil-b.html">supposedly supernatural ties</a> to Houston Rockets beard-o James Harden (who may or may not have illicitly borrowed the BasedGod&#x2019;s cooking dance).</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.3"><em>GQ</em> managed to catch up with Lil B shortly after he ducked into a CVS to buy a charger for his phone, which was running out of battery.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Is your phone charged? Where are you at? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.6">Right now I&#x2019;m just hanging out in the Bay Area.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>One of the editors here included your<em> GQ Magazine</em> track in a work email the other day.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.8">I love it. <em>GQ Magazine</em>, strapped with the magazine! We &#x2019;bout to get it big with that first cover. Shouts out to A$AP Rocky, I seen you getting that love on that <em>GQ</em>. That&#x2019;s a big look, man. Lil B, coming up next.</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.9"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_IzfDvB_JI0" height="424" width="648"></iframe></div></div><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>I heard you&#x2019;re going to the Warriors-Rockets game on Wednesday. Do you know where you&#x2019;re sitting yet?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.b">I gotta still figure that out! I wanna be with my folks, you know what I&#x2019;m saying? Somewhere close behind these players. A ticket costs enough! [<em>Laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Are you gonna be tweeting?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.d">Definitely, if I feel it&#x2019;s necessary. Other than that I just keep everything pretty authentic. Say what I feel.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Can I ask you for a small favor? Can you do like a reverse-curse on Steph Curry to make sure he doesn&#x2019;t get hurt?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.f">Yeah, you know, that curse stuff, that&#x2019;s really up to the BasedGod. Me as Lil B, I do know the BasedGod. But all that, it&#x2019;s really up to him. I just try to stay positive and keep it loving, you know what I mean?</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Has James Harden or his camp reached out to you at all about the cooking dance stuff?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.h">Nah, nah. The problem with them is that, they definitely do that silent treatment stuff. He learned a lot from Kevin Durant, you know?</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>What about the Warriors? Do they show you love?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.j">I get a lot of support from the Warriors organization. The Oracle Arena. A lot of the Warriors follow me. Shouts out to Klay Thompson. Marreese Speights. These are just a few I can think of off the top of my head. It&#x2019;s all love.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>I remember a few years ago you challenged Kevin Durant to a game of one-on-one. Is there anyone on this year&#x2019;s Dubs team whose game most closely resembles yours?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.l">Right now I really don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;m working on my fundamentals. I&#x2019;m a really good defensive player. I&#x2019;ve been working on my defensive stance. Defensive stance, fosho! You know, just working on getting things together. Getting that consistent shot.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Are you trying to pattern your shot more after Steph or Klay?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.n">I wish my shot was like that! Right now, I have my own unique shot. I&#x2019;m <em>really</em> stronger going to the hole on the drive. I&#x2019;m more of a defensive shooting guard. Yeah, that&#x2019;s kind of the way I play.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>What would you do if the Warriors won the title this year?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.p">I&#x2019;m just gonna be extremely, eternally happy. It&#x2019;s gonna be great motivation to see your local team doing great things and bringing inspiration. And bringing things to new heights and levels. I&#x2019;m definitely just excited about life. And life is really good right now.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.q">I want everybody to know that they&#x2019;re great. I love <em>GQ</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>Let&#x2019;s change gears a bit and talk about your fans who are graduating from college right now. I think I read somewhere that you were a women&#x2019;s study major. Is that true?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.s">Sometimes these internet things... they&#x2019;ll say some pretty cool stuff about me. But that&#x2019;s not true. No women&#x2019;s studies, but I get the people that think that way. [<em>Laughs</em>] Definitely interested in getting an associates degree soon and trying to continue to learn, you know what I mean? Really excited to keep learning.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>What advice would you give to new college grads, the kinds of kids who maybe used Lil B quotes in their yearbooks?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.u">Really just.... [<em>there&#x2019;s a call on the other line</em>] damn, this is CBS calling me. What I would say to them is that just continue to stay positive, figure out their passion&#x2014;what they would love to do for free without any money. See how far that can go, but really just getting together with people. Get the support of other people. People make things happen.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>Do you think it&#x2019;s realistic that everyone should figure out what they&#x2019;re passionate about, and pursue that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.w">Yeah, definitely. [<em>And here, he sounds distracted</em>.] Definitely.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>If you weren&#x2019;t a rapper/author/internet human, what do you think you would be doing career-wise?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.y">I&#x2019;m not too sure. Maybe neurosurgeon. Something in the health field. Biology, dealing with the earth. The animals. It would most likely be some kind of doctor. Neuroscience, neurosurgeon. I always wanted to do that, ever since I was young. Before rap!</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.z">But it&#x2019;s never too late to go back and study that. [I could still] be that neurosurgeon that I really wanna be. I&#x2019;d probably be the first to do it if I just stick to it.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong>So some of these kids who spent their teens listening to you...</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.11">Hey bruh. Brother, can you actually hold on real fast? On the other line is CBS and they keep blowing me up. It&#x2019;s a live radio show. Can you hold on one second?</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.12"><strong>Oh, sure.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>[<em>Holds for not even 3 minutes</em>]</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.14">Hey bruh! Sorry about that. That was a live radio show! Quickest possible thing. Now we back to it! Now I can give you that focus!</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>So these new grads! What advice would you give them for the job hunt?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.16">First they gotta realize how beautiful they are. They are amazing. They are survivors because they are alive.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.17">That means they&#x2019;re special regardless of any of the pain, or any of the second guessing we go through as humans. The first thing is realize you&#x2019;re beautiful, inside out. And we&#x2019;re not just talking about looks. We&#x2019;re talking about personality, thinking&#x2014;just being a great overall person. Know you&#x2019;re a great person.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.18">The second thing is, know that every day will not be the same forever. There might be something that&#x2019;s going on that&#x2019;s weird right now. But you&#x2019;ll be finding your job soon. You&#x2019;ll be finding what you need to find out about real soon.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.19">Let the earth send you blessings, you know? Get support from people. Build your community. Build your friends. Get some solid friends. Believe in each other. Try something new. Because that will go to the next step. Everything is always about going to the next step. And you don&#x2019;t have to step on people&#x2019;s toes to get there.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.1a">It doesn&#x2019;t have to be about capital. It doesn&#x2019;t have to be about you making money to get to the next place. Things can be done out of love.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.1b">And you can make a living off love.</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.1c">I hear a lot of people who say, &quot;Love doesn&#x2019;t pay the bills.&quot; Yes they do. It pays mine!</p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><strong>Off the top of your head, what Lil B tracks would you recommend to someone who might be bummed by the job hunt?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.1e">We got um, okay. You could play Lil B &quot;Foolin Around.&quot; That&#x2019;s one.</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ue3ixMW4DG0" height="424" width="648"></iframe></div></div><p data-reactid=".2ed3nnumrr4.1.1.0.0.4.1g">Let&#x2019;s do Lil B... play that &quot;Rain in England&quot; produced by the BasedGod, ecutive produced by Lil B, produced and composed by the BasedGod.
