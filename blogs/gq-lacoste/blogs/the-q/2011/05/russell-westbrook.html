  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThis is nothing new. Throughout the playoffs, that\u0027s been my answers to Russell Westbrook\u0027s critics. My longest post here yet was devoted to explaining, with no small measure of personal investment, how what we\u0027re seeing may just be Westbrook\u0027s contradictory essence laid bare. He has always needed the most grotesque kind of spontaneity, and freedom to indulge all his \u0022nobody believed in me\u0022 revenge fantasies, to make us take notice. If style is personality, compare him to that friend--probably from your early twenties--who showed you that people can bond over really, really bad ideas.\u000A\u000AIn some highly abstract, deeply Romantic way, it\u0027s nice to think that the Thunder could win a title with Westbrook constantly courting disaster, playing with a primal scream as his ringtone, and providing a compliment to the ultra-disciplined Kevin Durant. Maybe there was a way to tone down, or mitigate, his most crass impulses. This, I suppose, would be maturity, albeit without sacrificing too much of his precious instability. Westbrook isn\u0027t just a hopeless egoist like Allen Iverson and Gilbert Arenas, scintillating players who eventually ran up against their own limitations. Westbrook not only thrives under very specific conditions, he forces them on the rest of the game. It makes opponents uncomfortable, even dismayed, and that\u0027s why answering Westbrook when he\u0027s \u0022on\u0022 remains one of the NBA\u0027s great quandaries.\u000A\u000ALast night, though, we saw just how badly Westbrook gets to his own team, too. Well past midnight, the Thunder staggered out of FedEx Forum with a 133-123 win, after a triple-overtime epic that could easily have been over hours before. Westbrook went for 40 points, and some dude called Kevin Durant ended up with 35. Yet--remember, points totals only mean so much--that imbalance alone barely scratches the surface of how disoriented the Thunder themselves seemed. There is probably some Indian deity here that deserves a reference; is it more or less offensive if I leave the reference dangling and incomplete?\u000A\u000AIf you believe their press (I\u0027m including myself here), the Thunder thrive on chemistry and camaraderie. They survived the loss of Jeff Green by readily welcoming Kendrick Perkins into the fold. Scott Brooks will tell you, ad nauseum, that he communicates well with Russie, and understands exactly what he brings to the team.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s hard, after yesterday, to buy that line any longer. Tom Scharpling wrote on Monday that Durant had become an underdog on his own team. Never was this more evident than against the Grizzlies, when practically every shot leaped out of Westbrook\u0027s hands as if attached to a joy-buzzer (controlled by Phil Jackson, already loitering around the Gates of Hell?). He made plenty of unbelievable plays, but many of these were unbelievably silly and brain-dead. The problem wasn\u0027t so much that Westbrook took chances, or pushed when he could have drawn back and set up others. It was that as the third-year pro pushed himself harder than ever, his game got harder and harder to watch. Actually, strike that: His makes were more spectacular than ever, his misses and oversights, just plain gross.\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t want to think it was simply arrogance or insecurity, even if Westbrook\u0027s attitude toward Durant wasn\u0027t the real problem. Though, judging from Durant\u0027s frustration on the sidelines and post-game detachment, some unspoken line may have been crossed. Certainly, fan reaction, which went from outrage to utter disbelief, suggests that this was more than just an especially egregious case of \u0022Russell being Russell\u0022. Westbrook didn\u0027t just treat Durant like his sidekick--he basically froze him out. The real issue might be how genuinely bummed out the rest of the Thunder seemed.\u000A\u000ADurant spreads love. Westbrook, just doing his thing, tried their patience, pulled them back in, and finally, left them resentful. The team has never been known for its ball movement, a problem that doesn\u0027t simply trace back to Westbrook. But for once, they felt fundamentally uncomfortable with Westbrook\u0027s presence. Durant is reassuring, calm. Westbrook causes aneurysms on the spot. It\u0027s not his behavior, or performance that threatens the Thunder--it\u0027s what he stands for as a basketball player.\u000A\u000ACuriously, Westbrook might be the perfect ideological beast for the Grizzlies, a team that, without Rudy Gay, has been forced to depend on all sorts of wild variables on the perimeter and wing. Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol give them their legitimacy, and will ultimately decide how far they can go. So much of their game, especially last night, depends on unpredictable, even ill-advised play. Tony Allen brings that offense to life, and yet his signature move is an awkward floater that looks like he\u0027s trying to punch the basket. Conley and Mayo, from night to night, can be brilliant or largely absent. And remember, Conley\u0027s supposedly overpaid and Mayo was nearly traded at the break. Maybe the Grizzlies can play Westbrook\u0027s game, but at times they seem positively awed by the ways he can convert stupidity into gold. In the post-game, a surprisingly peppy Charles Barkley said that Memphis\u0027 effort in the loss was almost as impressive as the final outcome. For the Grizz, the ends justifies the means, and they embrace the mess that gets them there.\u000A\u000AThe Thunder are smarter, more advanced than that. They have enough skill, versatility, talent, and moralized character to not only get there, but get there with a minimum of potholes or busted fuses. Just as Durant\u0027s life has become shorthand for the way all Thunder players live in, and feel about, OKC, so his personality is the model for the team. The Grizzlies value process for its imperfection; Durant pays close attention to it because he wants it just right. There\u0027s no reason for it to be otherwise. No matter what the end, the means can fall under scrutiny. That\u0027s the way a championship team should think, at least our conventional model of one.\u000A\u000AThen there\u0027s Westbrook, who lives in some alternate dimension halfway between the Thunder\u0027s nerdy virtuosity and the Grizzlies\u0027 unhinged defiance. The question may not be is Westbrook bad for Durant, but do Russell\u0027s teammates even really understand him anymore? It\u0027s entirely possible that Westbrook may be an altogether more ambitious kind of ball-hog, one whose differences with the team are philosophical, not personal. And in that, they\u0027re more of a problem than ever.\u000A\u000A—Bethlehem Shoals\u000A\u000AShoals is the founder of FreeDarko.com and the co-author of The Undisputed Guide to Pro Basketball History. __",

If style is personality, compare him to that friend--probably from your early twenties--who showed you that people can bond over really, really bad ideas.</p><p data-reactid=".ak70he6ebk.1.1.0.0.4.2">In some highly abstract, deeply Romantic way, it&#x2019;s nice to think that the Thunder could win a title with Westbrook constantly courting disaster, playing with a primal scream as his ringtone, and providing a compliment to the ultra-disciplined Kevin Durant. Maybe there was a way to tone down, or mitigate, his most crass impulses. This, I suppose, would be maturity, albeit without sacrificing too much of his precious instability. Westbrook isn&#x2019;t just a hopeless egoist like Allen Iverson and Gilbert Arenas, scintillating players who eventually ran up against their own limitations. Westbrook not only thrives under very specific conditions, he forces them on the rest of the game. It makes opponents uncomfortable, even dismayed, and that&#x2019;s why answering Westbrook when he&#x2019;s &quot;on&quot; remains one of the NBA&#x2019;s great quandaries.</p><p data-reactid=".ak70he6ebk.1.1.0.0.4.3">Last night, though, we saw just how badly Westbrook gets to his own team, too. Well past midnight, the Thunder staggered out of FedEx Forum with a 133-123 win, after a triple-overtime epic that could easily have been over hours before. Westbrook went for 40 points, and some dude called Kevin Durant ended up with 35. Yet--remember, points totals only mean so much--that imbalance alone barely scratches the surface of how disoriented the Thunder themselves seemed. There is probably some Indian deity here that deserves a reference; is it more or less offensive if I leave the reference dangling and incomplete?</p><p data-reactid=".ak70he6ebk.1.1.0.0.4.5">If you believe their press (I&#x2019;m <a href="http://www.gq.com/sports/guides/201103/nba-guide/oklahoma-city-thunder">including myself here</a>), the Thunder thrive on chemistry and camaraderie. They survived the loss of Jeff Green by readily welcoming Kendrick Perkins into the fold. Scott Brooks will tell you, ad nauseum, that he communicates well with Russie, and understands exactly what he brings to the team.</p><p data-reactid=".ak70he6ebk.1.1.0.0.4.6">It&#x2019;s hard, after yesterday, to buy that line any longer. <a href="http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-q/2011/05/kevin-durant.html">Tom Scharpling wrote on Monday</a> that Durant had become an underdog on his own team. Never was this more evident than against the Grizzlies, when practically every shot leaped out of Westbrook&#x2019;s hands as if attached to a joy-buzzer (controlled by Phil Jackson, already loitering around the Gates of Hell?). He made plenty of unbelievable plays, but many of these were unbelievably silly and brain-dead. The problem wasn&#x2019;t so much that Westbrook took chances, or pushed when he could have drawn back and set up others. It was that as the third-year pro pushed himself harder than ever, his game got harder and harder to watch. Actually, strike that: His makes were more spectacular than ever, his misses and oversights, just plain gross.</p><p data-reactid=".ak70he6ebk.1.1.0.0.4.7">I don&#x2019;t want to think it was simply arrogance or insecurity, even if Westbrook&#x2019;s attitude toward Durant wasn&#x2019;t the real problem. Though, judging from Durant&#x2019;s frustration on the sidelines and post-game detachment, some unspoken line may have been crossed. Certainly, fan reaction, which went from outrage to utter disbelief, suggests that this was more than just an especially egregious case of &quot;Russell being Russell&quot;. Westbrook didn&#x2019;t just treat Durant like his sidekick--he basically froze him out. The real issue might be how genuinely bummed out the rest of the Thunder seemed.</p><p data-reactid=".ak70he6ebk.1.1.0.0.4.8">Durant spreads love. Westbrook, just doing his thing, tried their patience, pulled them back in, and finally, left them resentful. The team has never been known for its ball movement, a problem that doesn&#x2019;t simply trace back to Westbrook. But for once, they felt fundamentally uncomfortable with Westbrook&#x2019;s presence. Durant is reassuring, calm. Westbrook causes aneurysms on the spot. It&#x2019;s not his behavior, or performance that threatens the Thunder--it&#x2019;s what he stands for as a basketball player.</p><p data-reactid=".ak70he6ebk.1.1.0.0.4.9">Curiously, Westbrook might be the perfect ideological beast for the Grizzlies, a team that, without Rudy Gay, has been forced to depend on all sorts of wild variables on the perimeter and wing. Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol give them their legitimacy, and will ultimately decide how far they can go. So much of their game, especially last night, depends on unpredictable, even ill-advised play. Tony Allen brings that offense to life, and yet his signature move is an awkward floater that looks like he&#x2019;s trying to punch the basket. Conley and Mayo, from night to night, can be brilliant or largely absent. And remember, Conley&#x2019;s supposedly overpaid and Mayo was nearly traded at the break. Maybe the Grizzlies can play Westbrook&#x2019;s game, but at times they seem positively awed by the ways he can convert stupidity into gold. In the post-game, a surprisingly peppy Charles Barkley said that Memphis&#x2019; effort in the loss was almost as impressive as the final outcome. For the Grizz, the ends justifies the means, and they embrace the mess that gets them there.</p><p data-reactid=".ak70he6ebk.1.1.0.0.4.a">The Thunder are smarter, more advanced than that. They have enough skill, versatility, talent, and moralized character to not only get there, but get there with a minimum of potholes or busted fuses. Just as Durant&#x2019;s life has become shorthand for the way all Thunder players live in, and feel about, OKC, so his personality is the model for the team. The Grizzlies value process for its imperfection; Durant pays close attention to it because he wants it just right. There&#x2019;s no reason for it to be otherwise. No matter what the end, the means can fall under scrutiny. That&#x2019;s the way a championship team should think, at least our conventional model of one.</p><p data-reactid=".ak70he6ebk.1.1.0.0.4.b">Then there&#x2019;s Westbrook, who lives in some alternate dimension halfway between the Thunder&#x2019;s nerdy virtuosity and the Grizzlies&#x2019; unhinged defiance. The question may not be is Westbrook bad for Durant, but do Russell&#x2019;s teammates even really understand him anymore? It&#x2019;s entirely possible that Westbrook may be an altogether more ambitious kind of ball-hog, one whose differences with the team are philosophical, not personal. And in that, they&#x2019;re more of a problem than ever.</p><p data-reactid=".ak70he6ebk.1.1.0.0.4.c">&#x2014;<a href="http://www.gq.com/contributors/bethlehem-shoals">Bethlehem Shoals</a></p><p
