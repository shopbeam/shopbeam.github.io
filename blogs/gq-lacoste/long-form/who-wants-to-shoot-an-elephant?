                    </div>

                    <p><span class="line-1">It is just before dawn</span>
                    at a hunting camp in Botswana’s game-rich northern
                    savanna, and Robyn Waldrip is donning an ammunition
                    belt that could double as a hernia girdle.</p>

                    <p>“You can’t help but feel like sort of a badass when
                    you strap this thing on,” she says. Robyn, a Texan in
                    her midthirties, seems to stand about six feet two,
                    with piercing eyes of glacial blue shaded by about
                    twelve swooping inches of eyelash. She’s a competitive
                    bodybuilder and does those tractor-tire and
                    sledgehammer workouts, and there is no part of her
                    body, from the look of it, that you couldn’t crack a
                    walnut on. In her audition video for a
                    reality-television show called <em>Ammo &amp;
                    Attitude</em>, Robyn described herself as a
                    stay-at-home mom whose “typical Friday-night date with
                    [her] husband is going to the shooting range, burning
                    through some ammo, smelling the gunpowder, going out
                    for a rib-eye steak, and calling it a night.”</p>

                    <p>Robyn Waldrip could kick my ass, and also your ass,
                    hopping on one leg. Her extensive résumé of exotic
                    kills includes a kudu, a zebra, a warthog, and a
                    giraffe. But she has never shot a <em>Loxodonta
                    africana</em>, or African elephant, so before she sets
                    out, her American guide, a professional hunter named
                    Jeff Rann, conducts a three-minute tutorial on the art
                    of killing the world’s largest land animal.</p>

                    <p>“You want to hit him on this line between his ear
                    holes, four to six inches below his eyes,” Jeff
                    explains, indicating the lethal horizontal on a
                    textbook illustration of an elephant’s face. The ammo
                    Robyn will be using is a .500 slug about the size of a
                    Concord grape, propelled from a shell not quite as
                    large as Shaquille O’Neal’s middle finger. About three
                    feet of bone and skin insulate the elephant’s brain
                    from the light of day, and it can take more than one
                    head shot to effect a kill. “If he doesn’t go down on
                    your second shot, I’ll break his hip and you can finish
                    him off.”</p>

                    <p>“Anything else I need to know?” Robyn asks.</p>

                    <p>“That’s it,” says Jeff.</p>

                    <p>“Just start shooting when they all come at us?”</p>

                    <p>“The main thing is, just stay with the guns,” Jeff
                    tells the rest of the party, which includes Robyn’s
                    husband, Will Waldrip, two trackers, this journalist, a
                    videographer who chronicles Jeff’s hunts for a
                    television program, <em>Deadliest Hunts</em>, and a
                    government game scout whose job it is to ensure that
                    the hunt goes according to code. The bunch of us pile
                    into the open bed of a Land Cruiser and set off into
                    the savanna, the guides and the Waldrips peering into
                    the lavender pre-dawn for an elephant to shoot.</p>

                    <p>If you are the sort of person who harbors prejudices
                    against people who blow sums greater than America’s
                    median yearly income to shoot rare animals for sport,
                    let me say that Will and Robyn Waldrip are very easy
                    people to like. They didn’t grow up doing this sort of
                    thing. Robyn’s dad was a fireman who took her squirrel
                    hunting because it was a cheap source of fun and meat.
                    Will’s father was a park ranger. In his twenties, Will
                    went into the architectural-steel business, and now he
                    co-owns a company worth many millions of dollars. They
                    look like models from a Cabela’s catalog. They are
                    companionable and jolly, and part of the pleasure of
                    their company is the feeling that you’ve been welcomed
                    into a kind of America where no one is ever fat or weak
                    or ugly or gets sad about things.</p>

                    <p>The Waldrips arrived in Rann’s camp on the eighth of
                    July, and they’ve allotted ten days for the hunt. But
                    it is unlikely to take that long to find their trophy.
                    Botswana contains somewhere in the neighborhood of
                    154,000 elephants, most of them concentrated in this
                    4,000-square-mile stretch of northern bushland where
                    the Kalahari Desert meets the Okavango Delta.</p>

                    <p>In addition to airfare, ammo, and equipment costs
                    (the antique double-barreled Holland &amp; Holland
                    rifle Robyn bought for the trip typically sells for
                    about $80,000), the Waldrips are paying Jeff Rann
                    $60,000 for the privilege of shooting the animal, at
                    least $10,000 of which goes to the Botswana government.
                    In September 2013, a ban on elephant hunting goes into
                    effect in Botswana, making the Waldrips’ hunt one of
                    the last legal kills. It is a precious, expensive
                    experience, and Robyn wants to take her time to find
                    big ivory, not to simply blast away at the first
                    elephant that wanders past her sights.</p>

                    <p>Through the brightening dawn, the Land Cruiser bucks
                    and rockets along miles of narrow trails socked in by
                    spindly acacia trees, camellia-like mopani shrubs, and
                    a malign species of thornbush abristle with nature’s
                    answer to the ice pick. No elephants are on view just
                    yet, though a few other locals have come out to note
                    our disturbance of the peace. Here is a wild dog, a
                    demonic-looking animal whose coat is done up in a
                    hectic slime-mold pattern. Wild dogs, among the world’s
                    most effective predators, are the biker gangs of
                    Africa. They chase the gentle kudu to exhaustion in a
                    merciless relay team. A softhearted or lazy dog who
                    lets the prey escape can catch a serious ass-kicking
                    from the rest of the heavies in the pack. What’s that,
                    Mr. Wild Dog? You’re on the endangered-species list?
                    Well, karma is a bitch. Let’s move along.</p>

                    <p>Now here is a pair of water buffalo. Charming they
                    are not. They scowl sullenly from beneath scabrous
                    plates of unmajestic, drooping horn. “Hostile,
                    illiterate” are the descriptors I jot on my
                    notepad.</p>

                    <p>And there is the southern yellow-billed hornbill,
                    and there the lilac-breasted roller, which, yes, are
                    weird and beautiful to look upon, but if you had birds
                    jabbering like that outside your window every morning,
                    would you not spray them with a can of Raid?</p>

                    <p>Say what? I’m unfairly harshing the fauna? Yes, I
                    know I am. I’m sorry. To the extent that I’ve discussed
                    it with Jeff Rann and the Waldrips and other
                    blood-sport folk I know, I believe that hunters are
                    being sincere when they say they harbor no ill will
                    toward the animals they shoot. Not being a hunter
                    myself, I subscribe to an admittedly sissyish
                    philosophy whereby I only wish brain-piercing bullets
                    upon creatures I dislike. I’ve truthfully promised Jeff
                    Rann that I’m not here to write an anti-hunting screed,
                    merely to chronicle the hunt coolly and transparently.
                    But the thing is, I’m a little worried that some
                    unprofessional, bleeding-heart sympathies might fog my
                    lens when the elephant gets his bullet. So I’m trying
                    to muster up some prophylactic loathing for the animals
                    out here. I want to be properly psyched when the
                    elephant goes down.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps out of a kind of kindred impulse, Will and
                    Robyn Waldrip are quick to point out the violences
                    elephants have inflicted on the local landscape. And
                    it’s true, the <em>Loxodonta africana</em> isn’t shy
                    about destroying trees. We are standing in an acreage
                    of bare earth ringing a watering hole Jeff Rann
                    maintains. It looks like a feedlot on the moon. Where
                    there is not a broken tree or a giant dooky bolus,
                    there is a crater where an elephant started eating the
                    earth.</p>

                    <p>“Man, [the elephants] have just destroyed the
                    ecosystem,” Will says. “People who oppose hunting ought
                    to see this.” Will is a bowhunter. Elephants aren’t his
                    bag. And while he has no reservations about Robyn
                    shooting the elephant, he is doing, I think, some
                    version of the hunt-justifying psych-up going on in my
                    own head. He wants to feel like it’s a good deed his
                    wife is doing out here, a Lorax-ly hit in the name of
                    the trees.</p>

                    <p>It’s midafternoon before we spy a candidate for one
                    of Robyn’s Concord grapes. In the shade of a very large
                    tree, a couple of hundred yards from the jeep trail, is
                    something that does not at first register as an animal,
                    more a form of gray weather. We dismount and huddle
                    before setting off into the brush.</p>

                    <p>The elephant appears to be a trophy-caliber animal,
                    but at this distance, it’s hard to say for sure. “One
                    thing,” Jeff says to Robyn. “If it charges, we have to
                    shoot him.”</p>

                    <p>“If he charges, <em>I’m</em> gonna shoot him,” Robyn
                    says. The entourage begins a dainty heel-to-toe march
                    into the spiky undergrowth. As it turns out, it is not
                    one elephant but two. One is the big, old, shootable
                    bull. The other is a younger male. Elephants never stop
                    growing, a meliorative aspect of which
                    (elephant-hunt-misgivings-wise) is that the mongo bulls
                    that hunters most want to shoot also happen to be the
                    oldest animals, usually within five or so years of
                    mandatory retirement, when elephants lose their last
                    set of molars and starve to death.</p>

                    <p>For the record, this detail does not soothe me as
                    the guns make their way toward the elephants under the
                    tree. I have not yet figured out how to dislike
                    elephants enough to want to see one shot. In private
                    treason against my hosts, I am thinking, <em>Not now,
                    not now. Let it please not get shot today.</em></p>

                    <p>We near the creatures. The big bull shifts its ears,
                    and it is a significant event, like the hoisting of a
                    schooner’s rigging. Jeff lifts his binoculars. As it
                    turns out, the bull is missing a tusk, probably broken
                    off in a fight. So it will not be shot, its ultimate
                    reward for the tusk-snapping tussle.</p>

                    <p>We creep back to the jeep. Robyn is electrified,
                    breathing hard, her blue eyes luminous with adrenaline:
                    “That was big!” she says to Will. “As soon as we got
                    out of the truck, was your heart going?”</p>

                    <p>“Nah, but when he turned and his ears spread and he
                    went from huge to massive? Yeah.”</p>

                    <p>“Huge,” says Robyn. “It could just mow us down.”</p>

                    <p>“We’d be jelly,” says Will. “But you wouldn’t want
                    to have shot him on your first day, anyway.”</p>

                    <p><span class="bold-text">Fair warning:</span> An
                    elephant <em>does</em> get shot in this story. It gets
                    shot pretty soon. Maybe that upsets you, as it did 100
                    percent of the people (hunters and nonhunters) to whom
                    I mentioned this assignment.</p>

                    <p>Elephants are obviously amazing, or rather, they are
                    obvious receptacles for our amazement, because they
                    seem to be a lot like us. They live about as long as we
                    do. They understand it when we point at things, which
                    our nearest living evolutionary relative, the
                    chimpanzee, doesn’t really. They can unlock locks with
                    their trunks. They recognize themselves in mirrors.
                    They are socially sophisticated. They stay with the
                    same herds for life, or the cows do, anyway. They mourn
                    their dead. They like getting drunk (and are known to
                    loot village liquor stashes in Africa and India). When
                    an elephant keels over, its friends sometimes break
                    their tusks trying to get it to stand up again. They
                    bury their dead. They bear grudges against people
                    who’ve hurt them, and sometimes go on revenge
                    campaigns. They cry.</p>

                    <p>So why would you want to put a bullet in one? Well,
                    if we are to take hunters at their word, it is because
                    the experience of shooting an animal yields a thrill, a
                    high that humans have been getting off on since we
                    clubbed our first cave bear. And if you go in for this
                    sort of thing, then it arguably stands to reason that
                    the bigger the beast, the bigger the thrill when it
                    hits the ground.</p>

                    <p>On the subject of hunting’s pleasures, Robyn Waldrip
                    has this to say: “It kind of taps into your primal
                    instincts. I think everybody has it in them.”<br>
                    <em>But an elephant?</em></p>

                    <p>“It was on my bucket list of hunting. It’s the
                    largest land mammal, and just to go up against
                    something that big, it’s exciting. I ran into this mom
                    at the grocery store and she was like, ‘What are you
                    doing for the summer?’ and I said, ‘I’m going to Africa
                    to do an elephant hunt.’ And she said, ‘Why in the
                    world would you wanna do that?’ and I’m like, ‘Why
                    wouldn’t you?’”</p>

                    <p>Jeff Rann has a similar take: “Hunting’s almost like
                    a drug to people that do it.” In his thirty-eight-year
                    career, Jeff has presided at the shootings of around
                    200 elephants, and he has never had a trophy get away
                    from him. It is Jeff Rann whom King Juan Carlos I of
                    Spain calls when he wants to shoot an elephant, as he
                    did in April 2012. (King Juan Carlos likely will not
                    get the hankering again. He broke his hip on the
                    safari—in the shower, not on Rann’s watch—and amid the
                    general outrage sparked by leaked photos of the king
                    posed alongside his kill, Juan Carlos was booted from
                    the honorary presidency of the World Wildlife Fund and
                    compelled to issue a public apology.)</p>

                    <p>Rann is the most perfect exemplar I have ever met of
                    Hemingway’s
                    speak-softly-and-shoot-big-things-without-being-a-blowhard-about-it
                    masculine ideal. He is lethally competent and
                    incredibly understated and cool, even when he’s telling
                    swashbuckling stories, such as the time he nearly got
                    killed by a leopard: “The leopard charged. I shot him.
                    It was a bad shot. He jumped on me, and we just kind of
                    looked at each other. I remember those yellow eyes
                    staring back at me. He bit me twice and dropped to the
                    ground. He also pissed all over me. For about a year,
                    I’d wake up in the night and I’d smell that strong cat
                    smell. But I don’t think about it anymore.” Or the time
                    he led the Botswana Defence Force into a camp of
                    poachers who’d been hunting in the land he leases from
                    the government. “We went into camp, and there were two
                    old guys and one kid about 16 years old. The agents
                    just opened up on them. Killed the two old guys
                    outright. The one they shot eleven times, the other
                    they shot fourteen times. The kid took off running, but
                    they shot him a couple of times in the back.”</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Q. So you, like, saw three guys get shot and
                        killed?<br>
                        A. Yeah.</li>

                        <li>Q. Whoa. Wow. What was that like?<br>
                        A. Didn’t bother me.</li>

                        <li>Q. Wow, really? Weird. Do you think that’s
                        because maybe you’ve seen so many animals killed
                        over the years that seeing the poachers get shot,
                        it’s, you know, just another animal?<br>
                        <em>[Patient silence during which Rann seems to be
                        restraining self from uttering the word “pussy” in
                        conjunction with visiting journalist.]</em><br>
                        A. I don’t know. Hard to say. Those guys
                        [illegally] killed a lot of animals. It pissed me
                        off.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In addition to million-acre leases in Botswana, Rann
                    has a hunting concession in Tanzania and a 5,500-acre
                    rare-game ranch outside San Antonio. The economic
                    downturn did not put much of a bite in Rann’s business,
                    a happy fact he credits to the addictive nature of
                    hunting’s elemental pleasures: “Our clients might not
                    buy a new car as often, or buy a second or third home,
                    but they’re still going to go hunting.” But this new
                    hunting ban is poised to do to Rann’s elephant-hunting
                    business what economic calamity could not.</p>

                    <p>There’s been a regulated hunting industry in
                    Botswana since the 1960s. Before the ban took effect,
                    the government was issuing roughly 400 elephant-bull
                    tags per year, of which Jeff Rann was allowed to buy
                    about forty. And counterintuitively, even in the
                    presence of an active bullet-tourism industry,
                    Botswana’s elephant population has multiplied
                    twentyfold, from a low point of 8,000 in 1960 to more
                    than 154,000 today. These healthy numbers, as people
                    like Rann are keen to mention, mirror elephant
                    populations in other African countries where hunting is
                    allowed. Despite a recent uptick in poaching problems,
                    both Tanzania (with 105,000 elephants) and Zimbabwe
                    (with 51,000) have seen similar patterns of population
                    growth. Kenya, on the other hand, banned elephant
                    hunting in 1973 and has seen its elephant population
                    decimated, from 167,000 to 27,000 or so in 2013. Some
                    experts predict that elephants will be extinct in Kenya
                    within a decade.</p>

                <div class="col-1">
                    <p>As the pro-hunting side has it, elephant safaris
                    assist conservation by pretty simple means: A bull
                    killed on a legal hunt is, in theory, worth more to the
                    local economy than an animal slaughtered by poachers.
                    In the most far-flung parts of the Botswana bush, the
                    hunting industry has been the chief employer, offering
                    a paycheck to people in places where there simply is no
                    other gainful work.</p>

                    <p>When locals’ livelihoods are bound to the survival
                    of the elephants, they’re less likely to tolerate
                    poachers, or to summarily shoot animals that wander
                    into their crop fields. Furthermore, hunting
                    concessions are uninviting to poachers. Hunters like
                    Jeff Rann employ private security forces to patrol the
                    remoter parts of the preserve.</p>

                    <p>Hunting’s critics maintain that, in practice, the
                    industry tends to fall short of these ideals. For every
                    professional hunter who follows the rules, there are
                    others who overshoot their quotas, or engage in illegal
                    ivory tracking, or cheat their employees of a living
                    wage. In countries more corruption-plagued than
                    Botswana, crooked officials commonly siphon off safari
                    profits before they reach the elephants’ rural human
                    neighbors on whose mercy and financial interest the
                    fate of the species ultimately depends. And lately, in
                    Tanzania and Zimbabwe (where last year 300 elephants
                    were poisoned in a single massacre), the hunting
                    industry has proven no antidote to poaching. Citing
                    “questionable management” and “lack of effective law
                    enforcement” in Zimbabwe and Tanzania, the U.S. Fish
                    and Wildlife Service, in April 2014, suspended the
                    import of elephant trophies from both nations.</p>

                    <p>But Satsumo, the Department of Wildlife and National
                    Parks employee who’s tagging along on the Waldrips’
                    safari, believes that Botswana’s hunting ban may
                    ultimately turn out badly for the elephants. “There
                    will be more poachers,” she says. “More elephants will
                    get out of the reserve. They will go to people’s crop
                    fields. The hunters pump the water for them, but now
                    they will have to move to the villages to find it. It’s
                    a bad thing. It’s a very bad thing.”</p>

                    <p>Abhorrent as the practice is to most Western,
                    Dumbo-adoring sensibilities, elephant hunting occupies
                    an awkward, grayed-out space in the landscape of
                    conservation policy. Some nonprofits such as the World
                    Wildlife Fund have quietly endorsed it as part of a
                    conservation strategy but decline to discuss their
                    position on record. The issue is such an emotional live
                    wire, for people on both sides of the debate, and is so
                    deeply laced with PR perils, that it’s just about
                    impossible to find a frank and disinterested expert
                    opinion about hunting’s efficacy as a means to help
                    conserve the species. It’s worth noting that I couldn’t
                    find anyone on the anti-hunting side who could
                    convincingly answer this question: If hunting is so
                    disastrous for the long-term survival of the species,
                    why do the countries where it’s legal to hunt elephants
                    have so many more of them than those where the practice
                    is banned?</p>

                    <p>With the next couple of tourist seasons, most of
                    Botswana’s elephant concessions will be converted to
                    photographic-safari destinations, which many
                    conservationists promote as an effective way to
                    monetize the animals and thereby protect them. But
                    according to Jeff Rann, photo safaris aren’t all that
                    difficult for poachers to work around. “[Photo
                    tourists] are not armed. And they stick to a set,
                    predictable routine, so the poachers just go kill
                    animals in parts of the concessions where they know the
                    photographics aren’t going to go.”</p>

                    <p>Obviously Rann’s got a vested interest in this
                    perspective. But looking at the case of Kenya, home to
                    one of Africa’s largest photo-safari sectors and a
                    poaching problem of catastrophic proportions, you sort
                    of have to give Rann his due. Of course, there’s every
                    possibility that some combination of public policy,
                    private money, and anti-ivory market pressures will
                    render hunting obsolete as a conservation instrument.
                    But for now, if you are one of those people who chokes
                    up at reports of poachers poisoning elephants by the
                    herd, you may have to countenance the uncomfortable
                    possibility that one solution to the survival of the
                    species may involve people paying lots of money to
                    shoot elephants for fun.</p>

                    <p>The hunt continues. We are not back in the truck ten
                    minutes before the tracker calls for a halt. Robyn and
                    Will linger in the Land Cruiser while Jeff and the
                    tracker go off into the bush to investigate. On the
                    heels of our run-in with the monotusker and his pal, it
                    feels as though the day has already coughed up a full
                    lode of potential prey. So it registers as something of
                    a surprise when Jeff returns with this news: “There’s
                    five bulls, all of ’em pretty good size.” One of them
                    is carrying at least sixty pounds of ivory, Jeff’s
                    threshold, I gather, for trophy viability. “It’s a
                    shooter,” he says. “If we get a shot, we’ve gotta shoot
                    it.”</p>

                    <p>Robyn shoulders her rifle. Her eyes are
                    incandescent. Off we troop over the sand.</p>

                    <p>The bush resounds with a din of timber destruction.
                    The sun is making its descent, and perhaps a hundred
                    yards off, through the brambles, tusks glow in the rich
                    light. The animals are fanned out ahead of us, noisily
                    munching. We come in closer, and the elephants begin to
                    take note, though we register more as a mild irritant,
                    not a mortal threat. The trophy animal is in a lane of
                    dense shrubs, mooning us. Robyn could conceivably flank
                    it and get an angle on its head, but in the thick
                    undergrowth it would be a poor shot, and that first
                    bullet might be all she’d get. There’s a risk that she
                    would only wound it and her $60,000 would sprint off
                    into the weeds. Jeff and Robyn whisper tactically. The
                    elephant’s obliviousness is exasperating. It seizes my
                    lungs with a breathless frustration to watch the
                    elephant foolishly grubbing salad while we stand within
                    a stone’s throw, plotting the proper method to put a
                    bullet in its brain.</p>

                    <p>Not thirty feet from us, the elephant with the
                    missing tusk, the same elephant we just ran into,
                    suddenly appears, having made its approach way more
                    stealthily than an animal the size of a bread truck
                    ought to be capable of. The bull is pissed. It nods and
                    snorts and tosses snoutfuls of sand our direction.
                    <em>Okay, whatever you are, it’s kind of annoying, so
                    get the fuck out of here, please.</em></p>

                    <p>I find the performance convincing. It keeps coming.
                    Two more strides and the elephant could reach out and
                    touch someone with its trunk. The elephant looks to be
                    about twelve feet tall. The trunk weighs hundreds of
                    pounds and is easily capable of breaking a human
                    spine.</p>

                    <p>Apologies if that sounds like sensationalistic
                    inanities you’ve heard intoned sotto voce by Discovery
                    Channel narrators trying to ramp up the drama of
                    snorkeling with porpoises and such. But the elephant is
                    about fifteen feet away, and I will now confess to
                    being scared just about shitless. The elephant snorts
                    and brandishes its vast head. Lunch goes to lava in my
                    bowels. If not for my present state of
                    sphincter-cinching terror, I would well be in the
                    market for an adult diaper. This is an amazingly pure
                    kind of fear. My arteries are suddenly capable of
                    tasting my blood, which right now has the flavor of a
                    nine-volt battery.</p>

                    <p>Jeff Rann is in dialogue with the elephant. This
                    consists of whispering menacingly and jabbing his rifle
                    around in the air. The elephant does its pissed-off
                    little shuffle for perhaps a minute, probably less. And
                    then the tape runs in slow reverse. The elephant
                    retreats backward into the shrubs, eyeing us, curtsying
                    hostilely as he goes.</p>

                    <p>“Wells, you good, buddy?” Robyn asks, grinning.
                    Apparently I’m visibly, risibly freaked. I regain my
                    bearings, and we resume our approach to the trophy
                    bull.</p>

                    <p>It requires the same strategy. The target is in the
                    middle of the fan of five. The elephants have arranged
                    themselves such that it’s kind of diffcult to get an
                    angle on the prize without straying into the paths of
                    the others. A disquiet, a shared unease, is taking hold
                    among these fellows. The racket of salad consumption is
                    tapering off. The elephants are beginning to push on.
                    But, goddamn, these guys could use a coach. The
                    interaction with the one-tusker notwithstanding, their
                    defense pretty much sucks. They’re moving, but it’s not
                    so much flight as a slow and cranky mosey.</p>

                    <p>The light is caramelizing. If Robyn can’t get a shot
                    in the next five or ten minutes, the sun will sink past
                    the trees and it will be lion-o’clock out here. The
                    sun, too, seems murderously slow in its descent. We
                    move past one elephant, past another, until we are on
                    the trophy beast. Again, its butt is to us. Nothing in
                    the animal world tops an elephant’s ass as an emblem of
                    indifference and reproof.</p>

                    <p>Coyness is keeping the elephant alive. If he does
                    not turn his head, the sun will set and the elephant
                    will not be killed today.</p>

                    <p>And then he turns his head. His expression is wary,
                    rueful. In his long-lashed bedroom eyes is the look of
                    an old drag queen turning to regard an importunate
                    suitor tugging at the hem of her dress.</p>

                    <p>Robyn raises her rifle. For the past few months,
                    she’s been rehearsing this moment in her bedroom closet
                    in Texas, aiming, reloading, aiming again. She
                    shoots.</p>

                    <p>The rifle’s thunder is somehow insignificant. The
                    shot catches the elephant in the appropriate place, at
                    the bridge of its trunk. But an elephant brain is a big
                    piece of equipment—it can weigh as much as twelve
                    pounds. Robyn’s bullet did not apparently sever enough
                    vital neurons to kill the animal in a single shot. He
                    shakes his head, as if to wag away the pain of a wasp’s
                    sting. There is a second shot that strikes him in the
                    neck. He turns to flee, but his right foreleg has
                    buckled. He strives to stand. The effect is of a
                    cripple trying to pitch a broken circus tent. In the
                    franticness of his movements, one can sense the
                    elephant’s surprise that his body, a machine that has
                    served him well for over fifty years, has suddenly
                    stopped accepting his commands. To see so large and
                    powerful an animal vised in an even larger and more
                    powerful inevitability is, for lack of a better word,
                    intense.</p>

                    <p>The other elephants scatter. Robyn and Jeff jog
                    toward the animal. In the fervor of the moment, Robyn
                    has momentarily forgotten to put fresh rounds in her
                    gun. “Reload, reload, reload,” Jeff instructs. They
                    advance to a distance of maybe twenty-five feet. “Okay,
                    shoot him right in the hip.” The gun fires twice. The
                    tent sags right and seems to sort of sway and billow,
                    as though surrendering to wind.</p>

                    <p>“Okay, come with me,” Jeff says. He leads Robyn
                    along the animal’s left flank. At the sound of the
                    hunters coming in close, the elephant struggles more
                    direly to rise, but instead, he loses ground against
                    gravity and settles closer to the earth. “Just watch
                    his trunk. [Be sure] he doesn’t hit you with it.”</p>

                    <p>Jeff leads her to a position perhaps ten feet from
                    the elephant’s left temple. “Okay, hit him right in the
                    ear hole.” At this point there is little the elephant
                    can do except to turn his face away. The last shot
                    claps into the elephant’s ear.</p>

                    <p>“Perfect,” says Jeff Rann. “Brain shot. You brained
                    him.”</p>

                    <p>And the elephant, still swaying on its haunches, a
                    slow faucet of blood trickling from his forehead, is no
                    more.</p>

                    <p>So that is how the elephant got shot. Once in the
                    forehead, once in the neck, twice in the hip, once in
                    the ear. How it felt to watch the elephant get shot is
                    something else. As I watched the elephant go down, what
                    obtruded into my consciousness was a kind of a
                    <em>thing</em>, a psychological sensation with a very
                    particular shape and weight and texture, a geometry as
                    discrete and seemingly physical as a house key or a
                    tire iron, but which I don’t have any useful language
                    to describe. This thing, this mute-pseudo revelation,
                    had something to do with adrenaline’s power to catalyze
                    time into taffy. Forty seconds elapsed between the
                    first shot and the last, yet what happened in those
                    forty seconds seemed to happen out of time. It was
                    another kind of time in which a new understanding of
                    death impressed itself upon me more rapidly than my
                    cognition could accommodate.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>The indescribable thought sensation was not this,
                    but some tiny part of it was sort of like this: Before
                    I saw the elephant get shot, I understood that there
                    was life, and there was its cessation. But now I
                    understand there is this other thing—dying, when death
                    stops being an idea and becomes a thing that the body,
                    if not the conscious mind, grasps in its full
                    intensity. Watching the elephant die granted the
                    illusory understanding of death’s grammar and meaning,
                    as with an alingual child who hears five words and
                    thinks he knows a language. The first word went through
                    the forehead, the second through the neck, the third
                    and fourth through the hip, the fifth through the ear.
                    The month before this trip, on another assignment for
                    this magazine, for the first time in my life, I handled
                    the corpse of a dead human being, and I learned nothing
                    about death. I learned nothing about death, either,
                    when Robyn Waldrip shot the elephant. But it left in my
                    skull at least the languageless shadow of the
                    indescribable thing: <em>Death is this. Death is the
                    elephant taking the first shot in the forehead, and the
                    second in its neck, slumping, listing right, taking two
                    in the hip, struggling, sinking, turning, taking one
                    through the ear and not moving anymore. As it was in
                    the beginning, and as it always will be: one in the
                    forehead, one in the neck, two in the hip, one in the
                    ear, world without end.</em></p>

                    <p>Sorry about all that. Useless, I know.</p>

                    <p>The dead elephant is leaking audibly. A substance
                    resembling scrambled egg is spattered on its ear. I’m
                    jotting notes and hoping Jeff Rann or Robyn does not
                    notice how badly my hand is shaking. But Robyn is off
                    in her own intense moment. She is sort of hooting and
                    jumping up and down, going “Oh, my God, oh, my God,”
                    and generally experiencing an order of ecstasy we tend
                    to share only with our intimates. On either side of the
                    animal, we are both of us breathing hard, massively
                    doped with a storm of neurochemicals that, if you could
                    synthesize in a smokable form, would make you very
                    rich. But the manner in which we are riding our
                    respective highs is a pretty good illustration of why,
                    in high school, Robyn was almost certainly a more
                    welcome and popular presence at parties than I was.
                    While I am privately gibbering darkly and visibly
                    whacked-out, she is pepped up, thrilled. We embrace her
                    congratulatorily. She kisses her fingertips and touches
                    the bull’s trunk. Salt water, rather gratuitously,
                    spills from the elephant’s eyes.</p>

                    <p>In the morning, the elephant is as we left it,
                    unmolested by snacking carnivores. Today, the animal
                    will be cleaned and butchered, its flesh shared out
                    among the locals. The hide and other mementos will be
                    packed up for the Waldrips. Though the tusks and the
                    rest of it are, ostensibly, the prizes Robyn came to
                    Africa to collect, the electricity has gone out of the
                    safari. Returning to the animal has a
                    cleaning-up-after-the-party sort of feel.</p>

                    <p>A team of a half-dozen Botswana men and women have
                    turned out for the event. The equipment list includes
                    an ax, a winch, and a bunch of cheap-looking
                    plastic-handled boning knives. First order of business
                    is a stropping orgy that lasts the better part of half
                    an hour. While that’s going on, the Waldrips’
                    children—Lola, 6, and Will junior, 8—who have been back
                    at the camp, play with the elephant, touch its trunk
                    for its rough, lichenish feel, handle its ears.</p>

                    <p>“It’s surreal, isn’t it?” Will senior says,
                    squinting at the creature.<br>
                    “Yeah,” says Robyn, a little dreamily. “I hope it stays
                    that way for a long time.”</p>

                    <p>I’m feeling it, too, the slightly spongy sense of
                    dislocation emanating from the previous day, but this
                    is why I will never be a hunter: She wants to savor it.
                    I am ready for it to go away. Before the skinning
                    commences, the tableau is beautified and made
                    camera-ready. The elephant’s tusks are scrubbed. One of
                    Jeff’s assistants takes an ax to a tree that is casting
                    an unphotogenic shadow.</p>

                    <p>“Look how long it takes him to chop that down,” Will
                    observes. “An elephant would walk right over it.”</p>

                    <p>Larry the videographer takes some footage of the
                    children perched on the elephant’s skull, though Jeff
                    cautions him, “You might get shit if you put that in
                    the show. You don’t want to be seen as disrespecting
                    the animal.”</p>

                    <p>The children dismount, and the skinners move in.</p>

                    <p>The cleaning goes like this: First you take the
                    ears. Each is the size of a manta ray. It is severed
                    close to the head and laid in the dirt. Next, the
                    trunk, the size of a middle-aged gator, is girdled at
                    its bridge and then removed. Blood comes forth in an
                    incredible tide, more of it than I’ve probably seen in
                    aggregate over the course of my lifetime. Yet the
                    flaying, surprisingly, inspires none of the mortal
                    vertigo the killing did. As the knives flash, the
                    animal becomes less extraordinary, less like the
                    world’s largest land mammal and more a bricolage of
                    familiar butcher-shop hues. The trunk is stripped of
                    its leather, and for a time it lies in the dirt,
                    looking like an automobile transmission made of fresh
                    raspberry sorbet.</p>

                    <p>Will is by the elephant’s rear. He has taken up a
                    knife, eager to do his share of the dismantlement. “I
                    always tell my kids, anything you kill, you gotta clean
                    it yourself. I know Jeff’s got clients who come out
                    here and kill five elephants. Shoot ’em and leave ’em.
                    To me that’s not right. Out of respect for the animal,
                    you gotta do it yourself. I didn’t kill this elephant,
                    but even still.”</p>

                    <p>A cut has been made along the spine. Will slashes
                    away, pulling at the skin, revealing a goreless expanse
                    of fibrous white fascia. The winch is applied to help
                    peel the hide. The resistance is sufficient to pull the
                    truck forward at first when the crank turns on.</p>

                    <p>Once the skin has been freed, Will and the skinners
                    begin blocking out the meat. The sound is of hard, wet
                    work.<br>
                    Up front, they are getting at the skull. The skin is
                    gone from the elephant’s cheeks, and the bare eye
                    peering from the pale tissue is demonic. Below the
                    eyes, the look of the tuskless head, still actively
                    suppurating, recalls a cliff face after a strong rain.
                    Then the head itself is cut off, into the arms of a
                    pair of catchers. Later today or tomorrow, the skull
                    will be buried for a period of ten days. Insects will
                    attend to the finer details of cleaning the skull for
                    its voyage to Texas.</p>

                    <p>When the head is removed, the elephant begins to
                    speak in a morbid throat-flatus. Air escaping the
                    trachea makes sounds of growls and shudders and sighs.
                    This is not upsetting. By now, it is not elephant but a
                    wrecked Volkswagen made of flesh.</p>

                    <p>The job wears on. How much of the creature, I ask
                    Jeff Rann, do the skinners intend to take?</p>

                    <p>“Everything,” he says. “This’ll probably feed a
                    hundred people.”</p>

                    <p>The skinners cut away fire-hydrant-sized wads of
                    meat and fling them heavily into a Land Cruiser’s
                    bed.</p>

                    <p>The carcass is winnowed to a pile of innards that
                    calls to mind one of those inflatable-looking sports
                    arenas. In the flawless blue above, a fleet of
                    delighted buzzards has begun to wheel.<br>
                    The work is mostly over. Will Waldrip can now retire
                    from the job. He is abundantly daubed in blood and is
                    exhausted, though chipper. “A little different than
                    quartering out a whitetail,” he says.</p>

                    <p>Amid the spare parts lying in the grass is the
                    elephant’s jaw, from which we can know the elephant’s
                    age. An elephant gets six sets of teeth in its
                    lifetime. This one was on its final set, and judging
                    from its condition it was probably about 53. The sand
                    of the savanna is hard on an elephant’s dentition. Five
                    to seven more years and it’d have blown through this
                    set and starved to death, assuming neither Jeff nor the
                    poachers got him first.</p>

                    <p>Looking at this rummage sale of elephant flesh
                    inspires an equally messy inventory of contradictory
                    thoughts.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><em>Eww.</em></li>

                        <li><em>Then a sort of wordless, inner viola fugue
                        that accompanies the sight of a magnificent
                        organism that has been treading the savanna since
                        the Kennedy administration, now scattered in pieces
                        on the ground.</em></li>

                        <li><em>Then, this retort: Yeah, but wasn’t the
                        leather your wallet’s made from once the property
                        of a factory-raised cow whose sole field trip from
                        the reeking, shrieking bedlam of the factory farm
                        was a terrified excursion to the abattoir? And
                        don’t you gobble bacon and steaks whenever you get
                        the chance? And aren’t “hypocrite” and probably
                        also “pantywaist” accurate words to describe a
                        person who gets queasy at an animal being flayed
                        but who eats meat and/or dons leather
                        shoes?</em></li>

                        <li><em>Right, but elephants are so smart, and
                        old.</em></li>

                        <li><em>A caged chicken once beat you at
                        tic-tac-toe. I don’t hear you crusading for the
                        pearl mussel, which can live for over a
                        century.</em></li>

                        <li><em>But elephants are so splendid to look
                        at.</em></li>

                        <li><em>Unlike a ten-point buck?</em></li>

                        <li><em>No, but okay, look: We can assume that most
                        people, for whatever totally arbitrary reason, have
                        an affnity for elephants over chickens and pearl
                        mussels. Sure, it’s the same illogical pro-mammal
                        bigotry that lets people mourn the slaughter of
                        dolphins and not mind so much the squashing of an
                        endangered spider. BUT? Isn’t it a little bit
                        fucked, when the average person looks at an
                        elephant and goes, “Aww, what an amazing animal,”
                        to be the one guy in a thousand who goes, “Yeah,
                        cool, I want to shoot it”?</em></li>

                        <li><em>So it’s bad to shoot elephants because
                        other Westerners arbitrarily sentimentalize them?
                        Consider your fantasies of grenading the deer who
                        eat your gardenias. Multiply that by about 10,000
                        and you’ve probably got a good approximation of the
                        feelings of the Botswana farmer who wakes up to
                        find that elephants have munched a full year’s
                        worth of crops.</em></li>

                        <li><em>No, I mean I guess I just don’t really
                        understand the impulse behind wanting to shoot this
                        big amazing animal, or how, after shooting one,
                        you’d want to jump up and down.</em></li>

                        <li><em>So what’s she supposed to do? Cry and drop
                        into the lotus position and sing a song in Navajo?
                        It’s not terribly hard to understand why people go
                        hunting. They go hunting because they find it
                        exciting. As Robyn herself put it, you get a primal
                        thrill. And whether or not you want to admit it,
                        you had the thrill, the neurochemical bongload that
                        hit you when the elephant died. It made Robyn
                        Waldrip jump up and down and it made you go on a
                        pompous, half-baked death trip, which is your
                        version of jumping up and down. You were at the
                        party, bro.</em></li>

                        <li><em>But I’m not the one who shot the
                        elephant.</em></li>

                        <li><em>No, you’re the one who came on this hunt so
                        that you could ride the adrenaline high while at
                        the same time reserving the right to be ethically
                        fastidious about it. I mean, what really
                        distinguishes your presence here from Jeff Rann’s
                        or the Waldrips’?</em></li>

                        <li><em>Maybe only this: Though the harrowing
                        intensity of the elephant’s death will, in time,
                        denature into a fun story to tell at cocktail
                        parties, right now I would trade all of it—the
                        morbid high, the anecdote for my memoirs—to bring
                        this particular elephant back to life.</em></li>

                    <p>The elephant’s skull is buried. Its flesh has been
                    hung out to dry. The Waldrips are booked at Jeff Rann’s
                    safari camp for eight more days, but these folk are
                    hunters, and the notion of spending a week doing
                    nothing but observing creatures of the wild holds
                    little interest for them. So tomorrow, they will go to
                    South Africa, because Will Waldrip Jr. wants to
                    undertake something called a “springbok slam,” which
                    involves shooting one of each of that species’ four
                    subvarieties. Jeff has an extra elephant tag for his
                    concession in Tanzania. He offers this to Will senior,
                    and Will declines.</p>

                    <p>Our last evening in camp, we go for sunset cocktails
                    at a locally famous baobab tree. The tree is craggy,
                    Gandalfian, and 1,000 years old. It has a crazed unruly
                    spread of branches, which inspired the folk saying,
                    Jeff tells us, that “God pulled the baobab out of the
                    ground and stuck it upside down.” A leopard sometimes
                    hangs out in the man-sized cave in its trunk. The
                    leopard isn’t home. The only locals on the scene are a
                    squadron of huge buzzards, resting in the baobab’s
                    branches. The camp dumps its hunting refuse not too far
                    from here, and the buzzards, Jeff tells us, have likely
                    spent the day gorging on the remains of Robyn’s
                    elephant. At our approach, they take grudging flight in
                    a storm of black wings.</p>

                    <p>While Jeff’s wife is arranging the cocktail table,
                    the party moves in to have a look at the leopard hole.
                    Suddenly the sounds of shrieking pierce the quiet of
                    the dusk. My first thought is that the leopard was home
                    after all and has mauled one of the children. But it
                    turns out that one last buzzard had been hiding in the
                    tree. The bird had gobbled so much of Robyn’s elephant
                    that it couldn’t take off. So, to attain flight weight,
                    the buzzard started puking on the safari group. Fran,
                    the Waldrips’ nanny, got the heftiest portion of
                    Robyn’s elephant, on her shoulders and hair, and Jeff
                    Rann got speckled a bit. The elephant huntress herself
                    dodged the vomit entirely as the bird set a course for
                    the sun.</p>
