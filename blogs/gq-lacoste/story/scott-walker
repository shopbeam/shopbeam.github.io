  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestPhoto: Chris Maddaloni/Getty Images\u000A\u000A\u0022One of the problems I see with Republicans nationally—well, three,\u0022 said Scott Walker as he munched on a piece of white string cheese. \u0022They\u0027re always against Obama, so they\u0027re not optimistic. I try to be optimistic and visionary. Second, they talk in terms that most people can\u0027t relate to. Fiscal cliffs and sequesters don\u0027t mean anything to most people. I talk about whether your kid coming out of college is gonna have a job. And third, they don\u0027t get out much—and I\u0027m around the state quite a bit.\u0022\u000A\u000AAt the moment, Walker was in the farming community of Mount Horeb, Wisconsin. We were having this conversation at the end of the local Dairy Breakfast, an unabashedly cornball state pastime wherein thousands of rural folks congregate on a dairy farm to eat pancakes and cheese served up to them by their local politicians. Walker had spent the past hour handing out cartons of milk, posing for occasional pictures, and peppering the air with jittery patter like \u0022Nothing better than Dairy Breakfast!\u0022 and \u0022Couldn\u0027t ask for better weather!\u0022 The farmers who talked to him addressed him as Scott. Most of them seemed not to notice him at all. This was odd enough, given that Walker is a sitting governor in the heat of a contentious reelection battle, and odder still considering that should he win reelection (and Walker is anything but a lock to do so), he\u0027s likely to be running for president a few months from now. But Walker is more than just another upwardly mobile officeholder. He is a national symbol of Darwinian partisanship—one who has led a frontal assault on unions and by extension the Democratic Party, weathered a bitterly waged recall effort, and is currently dogged by a hazy but persistent waft of scandal that could engulf him at any moment. He is, arguably, the most conservative governor in America—a guy who, should he survive the spirited reelection challenge he now faces, could emerge as proof that appealing with uncompromising intensity to the passions of archconservatives can still win you elections in purple states. Or, in defeat, Walker could provide the latest cautionary tale of GOP intransigence. This was the man serving food at the Dairy Breakfast. He wore jeans, a windbreaker, and a white Izod shirt, and aside from his extreme paleness and his bleary-yet-fid rhinoceros gaze, he bore an uncanny resemblance to every not-famous Caucasian male the world over.\u000A\u000ATo linger in the company of someone so nondescript and yet so powerful is a confounding experience. Walker\u0027s friends maintain that he possesses that enviable guy-you\u0027d-like-to-have-a-beer-with quality Americans seem to seek in presidents. I wouldn\u0027t say that; Walker strikes me as approachable and well-mannered but not particularly chummy. Meanwhile, his adversaries assert that he\u0027s a heartless automaton: At the Milwaukee County Courthouse, where he served for eight controversial years as its budget-slashing county ecutive, local reporters nicknamed him \u0022Cyborg.\u0022 I wouldn\u0027t go that far, either. Scott Walker is instead a hugely successful career politician (\u0022I used to always tease him, \u0027Someday you\u0027re going to get a real job,\u0027 \u0022 his wife, Tonette Walker, told me), a consummate professional in a business that calls for mingling with the commoners as well as courting billionaire donors and gutting adversaries; a man who is both calculating (again from Tonette Walker: \u0022Scott\u0027s a planner\u0022) and at the same time, for a politician, anyway, strikingly unambiguous and unselfconscious. And all of this wrapped up in milky plainness. Probably Scott Walker would not be who he is were it not for the fact that the former Eagle Scout and preacher\u0027s son comes across, according to former State Assembly speaker Scott Jensen, as \u0022someone you\u0027d meet at a church picnic.\u0022 Earnest, inoffensive, docile...until—poof!—he\u0027s vaporized public-sector unions, forced women seeking abortions to submit to an ultrasound, and restricted early voting in ways that are sure to diminish Democratic turnout. Then back to the church picnic. That the wolf comes by his sheep\u0027s clothing honestly makes him all the more hated by the left. In Scott Walker\u0027s Wisconsin, bland is the new black.\u000A\u000AAnd it could sell. After eight years of Obama Otherness (preceded by eight years of dubious big-government conservatism), after shape-shifting McCains and Romneys, and amid a crest of nationwide disgust with ineffectual governance, an unassuming midwestern budget-cutting workhorse might well be the answer to a foundering GOP rather than a show pony like Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz, who are long on oratory but short on results. Given that he is currently running for reelection, it serves the governor to feign disinterest in higher office. Still, his friend and political adviser of over two decades, John Hiller, says, \u0022Of course he\u0027s going to look at it. Why wouldn\u0027t he?\u0022\u000A\u000AOne good reason why he wouldn\u0027t would be if Walker lost in November. As of last week, he and his Democratic challenger Mary Burke were deadlocked among registered voters at 46&amp;#x2013;46, according to a survey conducted by the respected Marquette University pollster Charles Franklin. Burke, a moderate Democrat who plays up her experience in business, served as head of the state\u0027s Department of Commerce and before that, as an ecutive at the Waterloo-based bicycle manufacturer, Trek, that her father founded. This week, the White House dispatched the First Lady to Wisconsin, where the Burke campaign has said the President will also visit in the weeks ahead. Notwithstanding the hand from the Obamas—and her own talents as a candidate—Burke has kept the race close all summer with the help of an enthusiastic anyone-but-Walker faction of Democratic voters. Walker enjoys a huge financial advantage and is an old hand at electoral alley fights. But should his luck run out, the best a defeated governor can hope for is a cabinet position in someone else\u0027s administration. If he holds onto his seat in November, Walker\u0027s success in Wisconsin—narrowly won though it would be—will undoubtedly figure into his calculations. What he\u0027ll be able to argue is that he\u0027s won in a swing state and then bent it to his will.\u0022 No other 2016 aspirant can make the same claim.\u000A\u000A\u0022What do Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Mexico, and Nevada all have in common?\u0022 he said to me after the Dairy Breakfast. \u0022Those are all battleground states that Barack Obama won in 2012—and they also have Republican governors. So why are state Republican leaders connecting with voters in a way that the national party isn\u0027t?\u0022 Walker repeated his litany of self-assigned virtues: He and his fellow GOP governors were plainspoken optimists who made the rounds. \u0022Not that any Republican is necessarily going to win the majority among women, younger voters, or ethnic minorities,\u0022 he conceded. \u0022But we can do a lot better. I go to places where you\u0027d never dream of seeing Mitt Romney or John McCain.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe irony of that last statement was surely unintended: In the three breakfasts we had been to that morning, I had seen exactly as many adult African-Americans and Latinos as Confederate flags—namely, one of each. Instead, this was a key slice of Scott Walker country, populated by thousands of white male rural voters. It takes more than them to win; and Walker, whose statewide approval rating has stayed unwaveringly in the neighborhood of 49 over the past two years, has consistently managed to unite a winning coalition even while advocating divisive policies. For a national Republican Party glumly pondering its shrinking demographics, Scott Walker would seem to be offering good news: Fire up the base, pick off a healthy share of independents, and you can continue to grind out victories for years to come. Republicans didn\u0027t necessarily have to persuade voters they were right, Walker maintained—and that had been the case, he said, going back to his very first win, for State Assembly back in 1993: \u0022The bottom line is I was pretty committed to my ideals, and that\u0027s why people elected me. Not necessarily because they were ideologically in line with me, but because people have become cynical about politicians, and they want somebody who actually stands for something.\u0022\u000A\u000ACredit Scott Walker: No one doubts whether he stands for something. The question for Republicans nationwide is whether his stances will elevate the GOP or sink it into oblivion. That question will first be tested at the polls in Wisconsin, a high-stakes electoral proposition that will either take Walker to the next level or finish his political career altogether.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022Good morning, sir! How are you?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Good morning, Charlie—I\u0027m doing better, now that we\u0027ve got a chance to get the truth out, absolutely.\u0022\u000A\u000ALike Dairy Breakfasts, Scott Walker\u0027s call-in appearances on the conservative talk-radio show of Charlie Sykes have become a time-honored Wisconsin political ritual, seemingly, though, with far greater frequency than his encounters with country folk. During this particular recent dialogue—one hesitates to term it an interview—the Milwaukee radio host offered up a series of Wiffle-ball questions pertaining to the so-called John Doe II investigation, in which local prosecutors have suggested that the governor had engaged in improper political conduct during the 2012 recall. Walker took each one over the wall. \u0022Just outrageous...old news... should frighten anyone in the state of Wisconsin...incredible abuse of power... The bottom line is, we\u0027re not gonna back down—we\u0027re coming back full force.\u0022 Walker, having been ceded the floor to speak straight to his talk-radio base, then segued into stump-speech mode. He heralded his administration\u0027s economic performance, belittled Mary Burke, and boasted that despite being \u0022the most scrutinized elected official in America today, time and time again the facts come back and show we\u0027ve done the right thing.\u0022 He then recited Scripture, thanked Charlie Sykes for the eleven free minutes of airtime, and hung up.\u000A\u000ABack when Scott Walker was a young politician on the make, he was known in media circles as a guy only too happy to supply quotes. Today the governor rarely does interviews. (At the outset, his staff would only promise me two or three of what they called \u0022pullouts\u0022—a chance to ever-so-briefly grab him after an event and on the way to his car—though ultimately I was granted two sit—downs of about twenty minutes each.) Instead, Walker\u0027s preferred vehicle for conveying his opinions is supplied by Sykes and other talk-radio hosts, since their deference to him is almost vassal-like. As Walker\u0027s former chief of staff, Keith Gilkes, told me, \u0022It\u0027s a medium where the governor can go on the air and deliver a message unfiltered.\u0022\u000A\u000ATalk radio is of particular value to Walker when you consider how he earns his victories. As in many states, Democrats in Wisconsin own the large cities and college towns, Republicans the suburbs and rural counties, leaving the midsized communities that remain up for grabs. The percentage of persuadable Wisconsin voters is somewhere between 5 and 10. Everyone else in the state has taken sides. Walker works his suburban/rural base with a vengeance. His message is foremost that of a fiscal conservative who never met a tax he didn\u0027t loathe. (He has voted for a single increase in his twenty-one years in politics, to help fund a basketball stadium.) More subtly, Walker courts social conservatives, who, Gilkes acknowledges, \u0022are the core constituency of Walker\u0027s base.\u0022 Meanwhile, his milkshake-breath forthrightness seeks to mollify voters in the middle whose tastes don\u0027t run to GOP fire-eaters.\u000A\u000ANot many Republicans can pull off this stunt. Most in fact have enough trouble choosing sides between the two wings of the GOP currently at war with each other: mainstream corporate conservatives and the pitchfork-wielding Tea Party activists. But Walker has rather deftly ingratiated himself with both. In so doing, he has closed the state\u0027s conservative ranks into an impressive partisan fist. (\u0022You can see it in Wisconsin—when all the Republicans are united, things work well,\u0022 says national Republican Party chairman and fellow Wisconsinite Reince Priebus.) That fist landed a devastating blow in 2011, when the new governor of Wisconsin and the GOP legislative majority ran the table on conservative initiatives—tort reform, tax cuts, defunding Planned Parenthood, expanding school vouchers, refusing federal Medicaid funds, privatizing the Department of Commerce, and, oh yes, forcing public employees to pay into their pensions and health benefits while stripping them of collective-bargaining powers in the process—against a tidal wave of demonstrations and, later, a public recall effort.\u000A\u000AStill, Walker pulled it off—and not by phasing it in or charting a middle course or cowering behind his office door. No: Walker faced the TV cameras, made his case (that it wasn\u0027t fair, especially during a recession, for public employees not to be contributing a dime to their own benefits), and reaped the whirlwind. The gambit made Scott Walker a conservative folk hero and provided him a national fund-raising base to go with his exalted new status. In the process, he also became an arch-villain of the left. But—and here is Walker\u0027s unique claim among 2016 contenders—he also won over just enough hearts in the middle to keep his office. In fact, to this day nearly one in four Wisconsin union members continues to support Scott Walker, their greatest foe, a guy who would seem to stand squarely against them but who still stands for something.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022I find that people in the center aren\u0027t necessarily looking for a litmus test as they are hungry for leadership,\u0022 Walker told me one afternoon in a hotel suite in downtown Milwaukee. The Wisconsin governor had been discussing Mitt Romney\u0027s failed 2012 presidential campaign—which, from a purely political vantage point, seemed to offend his sensibilities far more than anything Barack Obama has ever done. Walker told me that during the early stages of that campaign, he often e-mailed Romney with tidbits of advice, to which the candidate had always responded with gratitude. Later, however, Walker fired off a more pointed litany exhorting Mitt to make a more distinctive case for a Romney presidency. He did not hear back.\u000A\u000A\u0022They took the best things about Mitt Romney and hid them,\u0022 Walker told me. \u0022And they made the huge mistake of thinking that the 1980 Reagan campaign was based on the premise of that great question, \u0027Are you better off than you were four years ago?\u0027 What they failed to realize is that that wasn\u0027t his argument—it was his closing argument. The larger argument was smaller government, lower tas, more freedom. And that way people could see not only that life was miserable under Jimmy Carter but that life would be better under Ronald Reagan. Often as Republicans we tend to do this—we get what\u0027s wrong about Barack Obama. And Americans know it, too; you didn\u0027t need to beat it in. You needed to show how you\u0027d be different.\u0022\u000A\u000ALet\u0027s stipulate that Scott Walker would indeed be different—from Obama, from Hillary Clinton, and from the sundry Republicans currently hovering over the 2016 abyss. The case for Walker\u0027s nomination begins with the observation that among the GOP-primary electorate, he possesses no glaring negatives. This could of course change down the road, if the John Doe II investigation concludes that Walker was in fact orchestrating political activity with outside groups during the 2012 recall in violation of campaign—finance laws. But thus far the most titillating disclosure the inquiry has produced is an e-mail from the governor to GOP &amp;#xFC;ber-strategist Karl Rove that was widely misread by Walker haters. (The e-mail does testify to Walker\u0027s zeal for commandeering political warfare. I would have loved to have discussed it with him, but I was instead advised by his communications director, Tom Evenson, that Walker would have nothing further to say on the subject of John Doe II.) For now, it seems safe to say that Walker\u0027s portfolio includes no Bridgegates, no YouTube-worthy snafus, no flip-flops, no whacko-bird behavioral defects. Instead, predicts former Assembly Speaker Jensen, \u0022He will be the candidate that all sides will have something good to say about. They may be more passionate about another candidate, but he\u0027ll be on everyone\u0027s list of acceptable. That\u0027s a good place to be, going into Iowa.\u0022\u000A\u000AWalker begins, in other words, with the armor to weather what promises to be a brutal primary slog—one in which having consistently prevailed in close races can be seen as a virtue. One could then postulate that while the low-key midwesterner isn\u0027t likely to stand out among the blaring 2016 cast of Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul, his eerie certitude may wear well over time. One could interpret his understatedness as a virtue, noting that in a country beset by political paralysis and hollow rhetoric, Walker stands out as a doer—the rare officeholder who, as the RNC\u0027s Priebus puts it, \u0022makes and keeps the big promise.\u0022 One could take it a step further and argue that no other conservative politician in America has walked the talk as convincingly as the governor of Wisconsin.\u000A\u000AAnd along the way, he has flashed some native skills that would serve a political marathoner well. He has turned the heads of big conservative donors like the Koch brothers, whose organization Americans for Prosperity contributed $10 million to supporting Walker and the GOP state senators being subjected to a recall vote, according to Politifact Wisconsin. (\u0022Most candidates make the mistake of viewing fund-raising as a chore, because they don\u0027t like asking for money,\u0022 Walker told me. \u0022I don\u0027t ask for money. I tell people what I intend to do and why it\u0027s important. And literally nine out of ten times, when I get to the end, they say, \u0027How can I help you?\u0027 Literally!\u0022) His self-discipline was on national display during 2011\u0027s union-busting saga and the subsequent recall; as the State Assembly Speaker at the time, Jeff Fitzgerald, says, \u0022You cannot rattle this guy. He knows his stuff, and he stays on message. I remember watching that debate debacle with Rick Perry, how a couple of questions could throw him into a tailspin. You won\u0027t see that with Scott Walker.\u0022\u000A\u000A Perhaps more than anything else, Scott Walker\u0027s trajectory amounts to a master class on political opportunism. And as his longtime adviser John Hiller puts it, \u0022In politics, you\u0027ve got to strike when the iron is hot. I think Walker looks at it that way and says, \u0027I should do it now.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ANot long after Scott Walker first made eye contact with Tonette Tarantino during karaoke night at the Milwaukee ribs haven Saz\u0027s one evening in 1990, and then proposed to her on a cocktail napkin at Saz\u0027s a few months later, the young Red Cross marketing specialist confided his ambition.\u000A\u000A\u0022Someday I\u0027m going to be governor,\u0022 he told his fiancée.\u000A\u000A\u0022And that\u0027s a 25-year-old guy saying that,\u0022 the first lady of Wisconsin now says. \u0022And I just laughed and was like, \u0027Seriously?\u0027 And he said, \u0027It might not come true. But you have to have some kind of vision.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AWalker\u0027s vision from the start was that of an upwardly mobile archconservative who assiduously tailored his politics to fit the moment. He first took office, says his longtime political confidante Jim Villa, \u0022at a time when law and order was an issue—which illustrates his keen political wit, understanding that\u0027s what people were paying attention to.\u0022 The young state assemblyman consistently advocated more prisons, harsher sentences, and fewer employment opportunities for ex-convicts. At the same time, Walker staked out his turf as an anti-tax crusader, even when it meant siding against Republican governor Tommy Thompson\u0027s gasoline tax as a freshman. His party leaders were not amused; as Scott Jensen, who was then the Assembly\u0027s Republican majority leader, recalls, \u0022I think there were two things at play. First, Scott was sincerely of the view that he didn\u0027t come here to raise tas. I think he also knew it was a chance to elevate his profile in the Milwaukee talk-radio profile. And he very quickly became a hero in the talk-radio crowd for holding the line on tas.\u0022\u000A\u000AJensen remembers a similar dynamic with Walker on social issues: \u0022It was an interesting mix of principles and practicality, wanting to have a 100 percent pro-life record. He played his cards really well.\u0022 Walker authored a \u0022conscience-clause\u0022 bill that would permit medical personnel to refuse to take part in abortions or prescribe morning-after pills. Another Walker bill would have levied $5,000 fines on medical-school professors for teaching about abortion. A third piece of Walker-backed legislation required doctors to describe to abortion-seeking women the fetus\u0027s physical characteristics and to urge them to listen to its heartbeat. None of these became law, and Democratic challengers routinely denounced him as an extremist. Walker kept winning. He courted the media, honed his reasonable-midwesterner message, and, says fellow former GOP assemblyman Jeff Fitzgerald, \u0022not only understood policy but was really about the consequences each vote would have politically. He knew the angles and could think two or three moves ahead.\u0022\u000A\u000AWalker had been quietly amassing a war chest to spend on a State Senate or U.S. congressional campaign, when a pension scandal rocked Milwaukee in 2002. He ran for county ecutive—slyly insisting to the heavily Democratic county that the R beside his name stood for Reformer—and won convincingly. But Reform was not in the cards, as the county board was overwhelmingly Democratic and aligned with unions. A dreary annual fiscal fracas ensued: Walker would propose a Spartan budget with a tax freeze, the board would amend it with tax and spending hikes, Walker would veto it, and the board would override his veto. Two years into his new job, Walker was restless. The day after he and Tonette attended George W. Bush\u0027s second inauguration in late January of 2005, he flew home, stood in the snow on the porch of his house in Wauwatosa, and announced to the press that he was running for governor.\u000A\u000A\u0022It was ballsy,\u0022 says his current campaign adviser Keith Gilkes. Others in the party were less approving. As in his early assembly days, Wisconsin\u0027s Republican kingmakers gathered to lean on Scott Walker: You\u0027re too young, too inexperienced. They don\u0027t know you outside of Milwaukee. It\u0027s Congressman Mark Green\u0027s turn. You\u0027re going to bloody him in the primary. You\u0027re going to hurt the party. For fully a year, Walker ignored them and ran hard. But the warnings became increasingly sharp, while the requisite campaign funds failed to materialize. \u0022I still think I could make a convincing case that I would\u0027ve won that primary,\u0022 Walker later told me. \u0022But in the end, if I win the primary and go down in flames [in the general election], I\u0027ve hurt the cause, and people are gonna say I\u0027m the one responsible.\u0022 So Walker at last withdrew—and in doing so, says one of the state\u0027s top Republicans, he earned points. The year 2006 turned out to be a bad one for Republicans anyway. Mark Green was among the defeated. As Walker put it to me, \u0022When I got out, the benefit of it was, I looked pretty smart.\u0022\u000A\u000ANot to mention pretty opportunistic. \u0022After Mark Green lost,\u0022 recalls Jeff Fitzgerald, \u0022Scott Walker never stopped campaigning. He was out there doing the whole circuit. It shows you the kind of political animal he is.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWisconsin\u0027s Republican Party convenes its state convention at nine thirty on a Saturday morning, which seems like a horrendous idea and possibly explains why all of the speakers are cranky to the point of dyspepsia. Senator Ron Johnson notifies the audience that Obamacare \u0022was built on a series of lies\u0022 before turning his attention to \u0022another lie: Benghazi!\u0022 The conventioneers applaud bitterly.\u000A\u000AAfter that harrumphing prelude, the convention\u0027s keynote speaker, Governor Scott Walker, almost comes off like a beauty-pageant contestant as he glides across the stage—jacketless, sleeves fastidiously rolled up to mid-forearm, sleepily grinning along to, of course, Brooks &amp; Dunn\u0027s \u0022Only in America\u0022—and launches right into a glowing assessment of his own tenure as governor: \u0022...Or as I like to say: Wisconsin\u0027s back ON!\u0022\u000A\u000ATo prove that he likes to say it, the governor thereupon repeats the phrase a half-dozen times, and with no apology Walker pirates and reconfigures the signature line of his hero Reagan: \u0022Wisconsin is better off than it was four years ago!\u0022 The audience—in every sense Walker\u0027s audience—is appreciative if not rapturous. No one seems aware that the politician he sounds most like is not the Gipper but Barack Obama, both claiming to have authored an economic turnaround after inheriting a mess from their predecessor. Wisconsin, like nearly every state, is benefiting from the Pretty Good Recovery following the Great Recession; and like the president, Walker tends to overlook the fact that unemployment is dropping in his state in part because fewer people are seeking full-time work. He also omits the facts that Wisconsin ranks thirty-third among the fifty states in job growth and last among the midwestern states; that his policies have created less than half of the 250,000 jobs he promised to generate during his first term; that (according to a research study headed by University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee economist Marc Levine) the lagging job growth in the state is at least in large part attributable to \u0022the austerity policies of the Walker administration\u0022; and that according to the same study, Wisconsin\u0027s best economic year in recent times was in 2010, the year before Walker took office, when the Obama stimulus (with the help of then House Appropriations Committee chairman Dave Obey of Wisconsin) pumped billions into the state and caused a dramatic leap in job creation.\u000A\u000AInstead, the story Walker is sticking to is that because of his audacious tax and spending cuts, \u0022Wisconsin\u0027s back on!\u0022 During his convention speech, the governor made up in self—discipline what he lacked in raw charisma: His message was all about the economy—\u0022that\u0027s the real story, not all these other side issues,\u0022 he declared...which of course made me wonder at the time just what \u0022side issues\u0022 he was referring to. Later that day, I asked the governor about the voter-ID law he had signed, which was now being challenged in the courts. Was this a side issue, or were there frequent occurrences of voter fraud in Wisconsin?\u000A\u000A\u0022Some, not a lot,\u0022 he readily conceded. But, he maintained, \u0022even if it\u0027s just one, tell me which citizen I\u0027m supposed to be okay with canceling out their vote because someone else is voting without legal status.\u0022\u000A\u000AWalker then added, \u0022I don\u0027t spend a lot of time on it.\u0022 Requiring photo IDs to vote was, for him, a side issue, like the forced-ultrasound and concealed-weapon bills he signed, like the state constitutional ban on gay marriage he supported as county ecutive in 2006, and the failed lawsuit against Obamacare he requested the state attorney general to file shortly after taking the governor\u0027s oath of office in 2011. Side issues that wouldn\u0027t merit discussion during his reelection campaign in 2014. But a year later, amongst a prayerful gathering in Iowa?\u000A\u000AThat question answers itself, of course. But in so doing, it leads to another question: Is old-school culture warrior Scott Walker the Republican Party\u0027s solution, or is he the problem? One of Walker\u0027s most commendable traits is his intellectual honesty. The words he typically uses when referring to his political résumé are conservative, aggressive, reformer, bold, unintimidated, and the like. Never does he identify himself as a \u0022unifier.\u0022 On the contrary, his two decades in office have been marked by bitter division. The governor now presides over a mild-mannered state bearing a deep ideological gash across its midsection. Credit him: He has done what he set out to do. He pledged to be a doer, not a healer. And in Wisconsin, Walker wins—at least thus far.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s yet to be determined is whether Republicans win nationwide with someone like Scott Walker, who seemingly doubles down on the conservative positions of old and offers little to those who are repelled by the party\u0027s exclusionary image. Demography, as you may have heard, does not favor the Grand Old Party. Its core constituency is shrinking; the millennial generation and persons of color identify it as the party of intolerance; its leaders, including Walker\u0027s buddy Reince Priebus at the RNC, have spent the months following Romney\u0027s loss fretting over how to move past the party\u0027s toxic ideological rigidity while not alienating its loyal base in the process. And so I asked Priebus himself: Leaving aside how the governor\u0027s record would serve him well in the early primaries, did the national party chairman believe that Walker\u0027s stances on matters like abortion, voting regulations, and same-sex marriage would help the GOP in its attempt to reach single women, minorities, and young voters?\u000A\u000APriebus hesitated for a moment before he offered his game reply. \u0022Scott has figured out the secret sauce of how to win in a very difficult place,\u0022 he said. \u0022I hear what you\u0027re saying, but it\u0027s not just about where the candidate stands on issues. I mean, a candidate has to be really likable and relatable. And Scott has that going for him in a big-time way.\u0022 He added, \u0022On same-sex marriage, I think it\u0027s more of how you say it than what you say. I think Scott understands how to talk and express himself in a way that doesn\u0027t compromise his principles but allows himself to ercise dignity and grace.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AShortly after hearing this from the RNC chairman, I got on the phone with another Wisconsinite, former governor Tommy Thompson. Most Americans know Thompson as George W. Bush\u0027s first secretary of health and human services, whose campaign for the presidency in 2008 clanked to a halt on the runway. In Wisconsin, however, Thompson remains a legend. He served four terms, from 1987 to 2001, and, says Milwaukee-based Democratic strategist Thad Nation, \u0022by force of his personality, Thompson just kept the state in a bipartisan cocoon. Whether you were a Democrat or a Republican, you thought Tommy was out there fighting for you.\u0022 In other words, he was the opposite of Scott Walker.\u000A\u000AI asked Thompson to compare their governing styles. \u0022Well, I\u0027m not being derogatory, but I was much more inclusive in that I wanted more people involved,\u0022 he said. \u0022And that\u0027s a different style. But Walker, you know, was faced with difficult problems, and he felt the best way to deal with that was through his own counsel and his closest advisers.\u0022 Should the governor decide to run for national office, Thompson said, \u0022he knows he\u0027s going to have to listen more\u0022—though, he conceded, \u0022the Republican primaries don\u0027t dictate reaching out all that much.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd that fact was worrisome, since, Thompson said, \u0022the Republican Party is going to have to evolve. They\u0027re going to have to be more inclusive of divergent views—which doesn\u0027t mean changing their principles, but they\u0027ll have to listen and moderate themselves on certain social issues—be more cognizant of where the country is going. A Republican candidate is going to have a difficult time winning if he doesn\u0027t do that.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhoever that candidate might be, the 72-year-old ex-governor said, \u0022they\u0027ve got to be willing to stand up and say, \u0027This is my position. This is what I believe in, and I\u0027m going to stick to it. And I\u0027m not going to be pulled this way or that.\u0027 The people want an honest candidate who\u0027s willing to stand up and say, \u0027This is where I believe the country should go.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AIt was only after we hung up that I realized what had just taken place. Tommy Thompson had, in that final remark, implicitly endorsed Walker (\u0022This is what I believe in, and I\u0027m going to stick to it\u0022), immediately after implicitly endorsing the very antithesis of Walker (\u0022be more inclusive of divergent views...moderate themselves on certain social issues\u0022). The man was hopelessly divided. Scott Walker had done it again.\u000A\u000ARobert Draper is GQ correspondent",

I try to be optimistic and visionary. Second, they talk in terms that most people can&#x2019;t relate to. Fiscal cliffs and sequesters don&#x2019;t mean anything to most people. I talk about whether your kid coming out of college is gonna have a job. And third, they don&#x2019;t get out much&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m around the state quite a bit.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.2">At the moment, Walker was in the farming community of Mount Horeb, Wisconsin. We were having this conversation at the end of the local Dairy Breakfast, an unabashedly cornball state pastime wherein thousands of rural folks congregate on a dairy farm to eat pancakes and cheese served up to them by their local politicians. Walker had spent the past hour handing out cartons of milk, posing for occasional pictures, and peppering the air with jittery patter like &quot;Nothing better than Dairy Breakfast!&quot; and &quot;Couldn&#x2019;t ask for better weather!&quot; The farmers who talked to him addressed him as Scott. Most of them seemed not to notice him at all. This was odd enough, given that Walker is a sitting governor in the heat of a contentious reelection battle, and odder still considering that should he win reelection (and Walker is anything but a lock to do so), he&#x2019;s likely to be running for president a few months from now. But Walker is more than just another upwardly mobile officeholder. He is a national symbol of Darwinian partisanship&#x2014;one who has led a frontal assault on unions and by extension the Democratic Party, weathered a bitterly waged recall effort, and is currently dogged by a hazy but persistent waft of scandal that could engulf him at any moment. He is, arguably, the most conservative governor in America&#x2014;a guy who, should he survive the spirited reelection challenge he now faces, could emerge as proof that appealing with uncompromising intensity to the passions of archconservatives can still win you elections in purple states. Or, in defeat, Walker could provide the latest cautionary tale of GOP intransigence. This was the man serving food at the Dairy Breakfast. He wore jeans, a windbreaker, and a white Izod shirt, and aside from his extreme paleness and his bleary-yet-fid rhinoceros gaze, he bore an uncanny resemblance to every not-famous Caucasian male the world over.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.3">To linger in the company of someone so nondescript and yet so powerful is a confounding experience. Walker&#x2019;s friends maintain that he possesses that enviable guy-you&#x2019;d-like-to-have-a-beer-with quality Americans seem to seek in presidents. I wouldn&#x2019;t say that; Walker strikes me as approachable and well-mannered but not particularly chummy. Meanwhile, his adversaries assert that he&#x2019;s a heartless automaton: At the Milwaukee County Courthouse, where he served for eight controversial years as its budget-slashing county ecutive, local reporters nicknamed him &quot;Cyborg.&quot; I wouldn&#x2019;t go that far, either. Scott Walker is instead a hugely successful career politician (&quot;I used to always tease him, &#x2019;Someday you&#x2019;re going to get a real job,&#x2019; &quot; his wife, Tonette Walker, told me), a consummate professional in a business that calls for mingling with the commoners as well as courting billionaire donors and gutting adversaries; a man who is both calculating (again from Tonette Walker: &quot;Scott&#x2019;s a planner&quot;) and at the same time, for a politician, anyway, strikingly unambiguous and unselfconscious. And all of this wrapped up in milky plainness. Probably Scott Walker would not be who he is were it not for the fact that the former Eagle Scout and preacher&#x2019;s son comes across, according to former State Assembly speaker Scott Jensen, as &quot;someone you&#x2019;d meet at a church picnic.&quot; Earnest, inoffensive, docile...until&#x2014;poof!&#x2014;he&#x2019;s vaporized public-sector unions, forced women seeking abortions to submit to an ultrasound, and restricted early voting in ways that are sure to diminish Democratic turnout. Then back to the church picnic. That the wolf comes by his sheep&#x2019;s clothing honestly makes him all the more hated by the left. In Scott Walker&#x2019;s Wisconsin, bland is the new black.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.5">And it could sell. After eight years of Obama Otherness (preceded by eight years of dubious big-government conservatism), after shape-shifting McCains and Romneys, and amid a crest of nationwide disgust with ineffectual governance, an unassuming midwestern budget-cutting workhorse might well be the answer to a foundering GOP rather than a show pony like Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz, who are long on oratory but short on results. Given that he is currently running for reelection, it serves the governor to feign disinterest in higher office. Still, his friend and political adviser of over two decades, John Hiller, says, &quot;Of course he&#x2019;s going to look at it. Why wouldn&#x2019;t he?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.6">One good reason why he wouldn&#x2019;t would be if Walker lost in November. As of last week, he and his Democratic challenger Mary Burke were deadlocked among registered voters at 46&amp;#x2013;46, according to a survey conducted by the respected Marquette University pollster Charles Franklin. Burke, a moderate Democrat who plays up her experience in business, served as head of the state&#x2019;s Department of Commerce and before that, as an ecutive at the Waterloo-based bicycle manufacturer, Trek, that her father founded. This week, the White House dispatched the First Lady to Wisconsin, where the Burke campaign has said the President will also visit in the weeks ahead. Notwithstanding the hand from the Obamas&#x2014;and her own talents as a candidate&#x2014;Burke has kept the race close all summer with the help of an enthusiastic anyone-but-Walker faction of Democratic voters. Walker enjoys a huge financial advantage and is an old hand at electoral alley fights. But should his luck run out, the best a defeated governor can hope for is a cabinet position in someone else&#x2019;s administration. If he holds onto his seat in November, Walker&#x2019;s success in Wisconsin&#x2014;narrowly won though it would be&#x2014;will undoubtedly figure into his calculations. What he&#x2019;ll be able to argue is that he&#x2019;s won in a swing state and then bent it to his will.&quot; No other 2016 aspirant can make the same claim.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.7">&quot;What do Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, New Mexico, and Nevada all have in common?&quot; he said to me after the Dairy Breakfast. &quot;Those are all battleground states that Barack Obama won in 2012&#x2014;and they also have Republican governors. So why are state Republican leaders connecting with voters in a way that the national party isn&#x2019;t?&quot; Walker repeated his litany of self-assigned virtues: He and his fellow GOP governors were plainspoken optimists who made the rounds. &quot;Not that any Republican is necessarily going to win the majority among women, younger voters, or ethnic minorities,&quot; he conceded. &quot;But we can do a lot better. I go to places where you&#x2019;d never dream of seeing Mitt Romney or John McCain.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.8">The irony of that last statement was surely unintended: In the three breakfasts we had been to that morning, I had seen exactly as many adult African-Americans and Latinos as Confederate flags&#x2014;namely, one of each. Instead, this was a key slice of Scott Walker country, populated by thousands of white male rural voters. It takes more than them to win; and Walker, whose statewide approval rating has stayed unwaveringly in the neighborhood of 49 over the past two years, has consistently managed to unite a winning coalition even while advocating divisive policies. For a national Republican Party glumly pondering its shrinking demographics, Scott Walker would seem to be offering good news: Fire up the base, pick off a healthy share of independents, and you can continue to grind out victories for years to come. Republicans didn&#x2019;t necessarily have to persuade voters they were right, Walker maintained&#x2014;and that had been the case, he said, going back to his very first win, for State Assembly back in 1993: &quot;The bottom line is I was pretty committed to my ideals, and that&#x2019;s why people elected me. Not necessarily because they were ideologically in line with me, but because people have become cynical about politicians, and they want somebody who actually stands for something.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.9">Credit Scott Walker: No one doubts whether he stands for something. The question for Republicans nationwide is whether his stances will elevate the GOP or sink it into oblivion. That question will first be tested at the polls in Wisconsin, a high-stakes electoral proposition that will either take Walker to the next level or finish his political career altogether.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.a"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.b">&quot;Good morning, sir! How are you?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.c">&quot;Good morning, Charlie&#x2014;I&#x2019;m doing better, now that we&#x2019;ve got a chance to get the truth out, absolutely.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.d">Like Dairy Breakfasts, Scott Walker&#x2019;s call-in appearances on the conservative talk-radio show of Charlie Sykes have become a time-honored Wisconsin political ritual, seemingly, though, with far greater frequency than his encounters with country folk. During this particular recent dialogue&#x2014;one hesitates to term it an interview&#x2014;the Milwaukee radio host offered up a series of Wiffle-ball questions pertaining to the so-called John Doe II investigation, in which local prosecutors have suggested that the governor had engaged in improper political conduct during the 2012 recall. Walker took each one over the wall. &quot;Just outrageous...old news... should frighten anyone in the state of Wisconsin...incredible abuse of power... The bottom line is, we&#x2019;re not gonna back down&#x2014;we&#x2019;re coming back full force.&quot; Walker, having been ceded the floor to speak straight to his talk-radio base, then segued into stump-speech mode. He heralded his administration&#x2019;s economic performance, belittled Mary Burke, and boasted that despite being &quot;the most scrutinized elected official in America today, time and time again the facts come back and show we&#x2019;ve done the right thing.&quot; He then recited Scripture, thanked Charlie Sykes for the eleven free minutes of airtime, and hung up.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.e">Back when Scott Walker was a young politician on the make, he was known in media circles as a guy only too happy to supply quotes. Today the governor rarely does interviews. (At the outset, his staff would only promise me two or three of what they called &quot;pullouts&quot;&#x2014;a chance to ever-so-briefly grab him after an event and on the way to his car&#x2014;though ultimately I was granted two sit&#x2014;downs of about twenty minutes each.) Instead, Walker&#x2019;s preferred vehicle for conveying his opinions is supplied by Sykes and other talk-radio hosts, since their deference to him is almost vassal-like. As Walker&#x2019;s former chief of staff, Keith Gilkes, told me, &quot;It&#x2019;s a medium where the governor can go on the air and deliver a message unfiltered.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.f">Talk radio is of particular value to Walker when you consider how he earns his victories. As in many states, Democrats in Wisconsin own the large cities and college towns, Republicans the suburbs and rural counties, leaving the midsized communities that remain up for grabs. The percentage of persuadable Wisconsin voters is somewhere between 5 and 10. Everyone else in the state has taken sides. Walker works his suburban/rural base with a vengeance. His message is foremost that of a fiscal conservative who never met a tax he didn&#x2019;t loathe. (He has voted for a single increase in his twenty-one years in politics, to help fund a basketball stadium.) More subtly, Walker courts social conservatives, who, Gilkes acknowledges, &quot;are the core constituency of Walker&#x2019;s base.&quot; Meanwhile, his milkshake-breath forthrightness seeks to mollify voters in the middle whose tastes don&#x2019;t run to GOP fire-eaters.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.g">Not many Republicans can pull off this stunt. Most in fact have enough trouble choosing sides between the two wings of the GOP currently at war with each other: mainstream corporate conservatives and the pitchfork-wielding Tea Party activists. But Walker has rather deftly ingratiated himself with both. In so doing, he has closed the state&#x2019;s conservative ranks into an impressive partisan fist. (&quot;You can see it in Wisconsin&#x2014;when all the Republicans are united, things work well,&quot; says national Republican Party chairman and fellow Wisconsinite Reince Priebus.) That fist landed a devastating blow in 2011, when the new governor of Wisconsin and the GOP legislative majority ran the table on conservative initiatives&#x2014;tort reform, tax cuts, defunding Planned Parenthood, expanding school vouchers, refusing federal Medicaid funds, privatizing the Department of Commerce, and, oh yes, forcing public employees to pay into their pensions and health benefits while stripping them of collective-bargaining powers in the process&#x2014;against a tidal wave of demonstrations and, later, a public recall effort.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.h">Still, Walker pulled it off&#x2014;and not by phasing it in or charting a middle course or cowering behind his office door. No: Walker faced the TV cameras, made his case (that it wasn&#x2019;t fair, especially during a recession, for public employees not to be contributing a dime to their own benefits), and reaped the whirlwind. The gambit made Scott Walker a conservative folk hero and provided him a national fund-raising base to go with his exalted new status. In the process, he also became an arch-villain of the left. But&#x2014;and here is Walker&#x2019;s unique claim among 2016 contenders&#x2014;he also won over just enough hearts in the middle to keep his office. In fact, to this day nearly one in four Wisconsin union members continues to support Scott Walker, their greatest foe, a guy who would seem to stand squarely against them but who still stands for something.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.i"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.j">&quot;I find that people in the center aren&#x2019;t necessarily looking for a litmus test as they are hungry for leadership,&quot; Walker told me one afternoon in a hotel suite in downtown Milwaukee. The Wisconsin governor had been discussing Mitt Romney&#x2019;s failed 2012 presidential campaign&#x2014;which, from a purely political vantage point, seemed to offend his sensibilities far more than anything Barack Obama has ever done. Walker told me that during the early stages of that campaign, he often e-mailed Romney with tidbits of advice, to which the candidate had always responded with gratitude. Later, however, Walker fired off a more pointed litany exhorting Mitt to make a more distinctive case for a Romney presidency. He did not hear back.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.k">&quot;They took the best things about Mitt Romney and hid them,&quot; Walker told me. &quot;And they made the huge mistake of thinking that the 1980 Reagan campaign was based on the premise of that great question, &#x2019;Are you better off than you were four years ago?&#x2019; What they failed to realize is that that wasn&#x2019;t his argument&#x2014;it was his closing argument. The larger argument was smaller government, lower tas, more freedom. And that way people could see not only that life was miserable under Jimmy Carter but that life would be better under Ronald Reagan. Often as Republicans we tend to do this&#x2014;we get what&#x2019;s wrong about Barack Obama. And Americans know it, too; you didn&#x2019;t need to beat it in. You needed to show how you&#x2019;d be different.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.l">Let&#x2019;s stipulate that Scott Walker would indeed be different&#x2014;from Obama, from Hillary Clinton, and from the sundry Republicans currently hovering over the 2016 abyss. The case for Walker&#x2019;s nomination begins with the observation that among the GOP-primary electorate, he possesses no glaring negatives. This could of course change down the road, if the John Doe II investigation concludes that Walker was in fact orchestrating political activity with outside groups during the 2012 recall in violation of campaign&#x2014;finance laws. But thus far the most titillating disclosure the inquiry has produced is an e-mail from the governor to GOP &amp;#xFC;ber-strategist Karl Rove that was widely misread by Walker haters. (The e-mail does testify to Walker&#x2019;s zeal for commandeering political warfare. I would have loved to have discussed it with him, but I was instead advised by his communications director, Tom Evenson, that Walker would have nothing further to say on the subject of John Doe II.) For now, it seems safe to say that Walker&#x2019;s portfolio includes no Bridgegates, no YouTube-worthy snafus, no flip-flops, no whacko-bird behavioral defects. Instead, predicts former Assembly Speaker Jensen, &quot;He will be the candidate that all sides will have something good to say about. They may be more passionate about another candidate, but he&#x2019;ll be on everyone&#x2019;s list of acceptable. That&#x2019;s a good place to be, going into Iowa.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.m">Walker begins, in other words, with the armor to weather what promises to be a brutal primary slog&#x2014;one in which having consistently prevailed in close races can be seen as a virtue. One could then postulate that while the low-key midwesterner isn&#x2019;t likely to stand out among the blaring 2016 cast of Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, and Rand Paul, his eerie certitude may wear well over time. One could interpret his understatedness as a virtue, noting that in a country beset by political paralysis and hollow rhetoric, Walker stands out as a doer&#x2014;the rare officeholder who, as the RNC&#x2019;s Priebus puts it, &quot;makes and keeps the big promise.&quot; One could take it a step further and argue that no other conservative politician in America has walked the talk as convincingly as the governor of Wisconsin.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.n">And along the way, he has flashed some native skills that would serve a political marathoner well. He has turned the heads of big conservative donors like the Koch brothers, whose organization Americans for Prosperity contributed $10 million to supporting Walker and the GOP state senators being subjected to a recall vote, according to Politifact Wisconsin. (&quot;Most candidates make the mistake of viewing fund-raising as a chore, because they don&#x2019;t like asking for money,&quot; Walker told me. &quot;I don&#x2019;t ask for money. I tell people what I intend to do and why it&#x2019;s important. And literally nine out of ten times, when I get to the end, they say, &#x2019;How can I help you?&#x2019; Literally!&quot;) His self-discipline was on national display during 2011&#x2019;s union-busting saga and the subsequent recall; as the State Assembly Speaker at the time, Jeff Fitzgerald, says, &quot;You cannot rattle this guy. He knows his stuff, and he stays on message. I remember watching that debate debacle with Rick Perry, how a couple of questions could throw him into a tailspin. You won&#x2019;t see that with Scott Walker.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.o"> Perhaps more than anything else, Scott Walker&#x2019;s trajectory amounts to a master class on political opportunism. And as his longtime adviser John Hiller puts it, &quot;In politics, you&#x2019;ve got to strike when the iron is hot. I think Walker looks at it that way and says, &#x2019;I should do it now.&#x2019; &quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.p"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.q">Not long after Scott Walker first made eye contact with Tonette Tarantino during karaoke night at the Milwaukee ribs haven Saz&#x2019;s one evening in 1990, and then proposed to her on a cocktail napkin at Saz&#x2019;s a few months later, the young Red Cross marketing specialist confided his ambition.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.r">&quot;Someday I&#x2019;m going to be governor,&quot; he told his fianc&#xE9;e.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.s">&quot;And that&#x2019;s a 25-year-old guy saying that,&quot; the first lady of Wisconsin now says. &quot;And I just laughed and was like, &#x2019;Seriously?&#x2019; And he said, &#x2019;It might not come true. But you have to have some kind of vision.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.t">Walker&#x2019;s vision from the start was that of an upwardly mobile archconservative who assiduously tailored his politics to fit the moment. He first took office, says his longtime political confidante Jim Villa, &quot;at a time when law and order was an issue&#x2014;which illustrates his keen political wit, understanding that&#x2019;s what people were paying attention to.&quot; The young state assemblyman consistently advocated more prisons, harsher sentences, and fewer employment opportunities for ex-convicts. At the same time, Walker staked out his turf as an anti-tax crusader, even when it meant siding against Republican governor Tommy Thompson&#x2019;s gasoline tax as a freshman. His party leaders were not amused; as Scott Jensen, who was then the Assembly&#x2019;s Republican majority leader, recalls, &quot;I think there were two things at play. First, Scott was sincerely of the view that he didn&#x2019;t come here to raise tas. I think he also knew it was a chance to elevate his profile in the Milwaukee talk-radio profile. And he very quickly became a hero in the talk-radio crowd for holding the line on tas.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.u">Jensen remembers a similar dynamic with Walker on social issues: &quot;It was an interesting mix of principles and practicality, wanting to have a 100 percent pro-life record. He played his cards really well.&quot; Walker authored a &quot;conscience-clause&quot; bill that would permit medical personnel to refuse to take part in abortions or prescribe morning-after pills. Another Walker bill would have levied $5,000 fines on medical-school professors for teaching about abortion. A third piece of Walker-backed legislation required doctors to describe to abortion-seeking women the fetus&#x2019;s physical characteristics and to urge them to listen to its heartbeat. None of these became law, and Democratic challengers routinely denounced him as an extremist. Walker kept winning. He courted the media, honed his reasonable-midwesterner message, and, says fellow former GOP assemblyman Jeff Fitzgerald, &quot;not only understood policy but was really about the consequences each vote would have politically. He knew the angles and could think two or three moves ahead.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.v">Walker had been quietly amassing a war chest to spend on a State Senate or U.S. congressional campaign, when a pension scandal rocked Milwaukee in 2002. He ran for county ecutive&#x2014;slyly insisting to the heavily Democratic county that the R beside his name stood for Reformer&#x2014;and won convincingly. But Reform was not in the cards, as the county board was overwhelmingly Democratic and aligned with unions. A dreary annual fiscal fracas ensued: Walker would propose a Spartan budget with a tax freeze, the board would amend it with tax and spending hikes, Walker would veto it, and the board would override his veto. Two years into his new job, Walker was restless. The day after he and Tonette attended George W. Bush&#x2019;s second inauguration in late January of 2005, he flew home, stood in the snow on the porch of his house in Wauwatosa, and announced to the press that he was running for governor.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.w">&quot;It was ballsy,&quot; says his current campaign adviser Keith Gilkes. Others in the party were less approving. As in his early assembly days, Wisconsin&#x2019;s Republican kingmakers gathered to lean on Scott Walker: You&#x2019;re too young, too inexperienced. They don&#x2019;t know you outside of Milwaukee. It&#x2019;s Congressman Mark Green&#x2019;s turn. You&#x2019;re going to bloody him in the primary. You&#x2019;re going to hurt the party. For fully a year, Walker ignored them and ran hard. But the warnings became increasingly sharp, while the requisite campaign funds failed to materialize. &quot;I still think I could make a convincing case that I would&#x2019;ve won that primary,&quot; Walker later told me. &quot;But in the end, if I win the primary and go down in flames [in the general election], I&#x2019;ve hurt the cause, and people are gonna say I&#x2019;m the one responsible.&quot; So Walker at last withdrew&#x2014;and in doing so, says one of the state&#x2019;s top Republicans, he earned points. The year 2006 turned out to be a bad one for Republicans anyway. Mark Green was among the defeated. As Walker put it to me, &quot;When I got out, the benefit of it was, I looked pretty smart.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.x">Not to mention pretty opportunistic. &quot;After Mark Green lost,&quot; recalls Jeff Fitzgerald, &quot;Scott Walker never stopped campaigning. He was out there doing the whole circuit. It shows you the kind of political animal he is.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.y"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.z">Wisconsin&#x2019;s Republican Party convenes its state convention at nine thirty on a Saturday morning, which seems like a horrendous idea and possibly explains why all of the speakers are cranky to the point of dyspepsia. Senator Ron Johnson notifies the audience that Obamacare &quot;was built on a series of lies&quot; before turning his attention to &quot;another lie: Benghazi!&quot; The conventioneers applaud bitterly.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.10">After that harrumphing prelude, the convention&#x2019;s keynote speaker, Governor Scott Walker, almost comes off like a beauty-pageant contestant as he glides across the stage&#x2014;jacketless, sleeves fastidiously rolled up to mid-forearm, sleepily grinning along to, of course, Brooks &amp; Dunn&#x2019;s &quot;Only in America&quot;&#x2014;and launches right into a glowing assessment of his own tenure as governor: &quot;...Or as I like to say: Wisconsin&#x2019;s back ON!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.11">To prove that he likes to say it, the governor thereupon repeats the phrase a half-dozen times, and with no apology Walker pirates and reconfigures the signature line of his hero Reagan: &quot;Wisconsin is better off than it was four years ago!&quot; The audience&#x2014;in every sense Walker&#x2019;s audience&#x2014;is appreciative if not rapturous. No one seems aware that the politician he sounds most like is not the Gipper but Barack Obama, both claiming to have authored an economic turnaround after inheriting a mess from their predecessor. Wisconsin, like nearly every state, is benefiting from the Pretty Good Recovery following the Great Recession; and like the president, Walker tends to overlook the fact that unemployment is dropping in his state in part because fewer people are seeking full-time work. He also omits the facts that Wisconsin ranks thirty-third among the fifty states in job growth and last among the midwestern states; that his policies have created less than half of the 250,000 jobs he promised to generate during his first term; that (according to a research study headed by University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee economist Marc Levine) the lagging job growth in the state is at least in large part attributable to &quot;the austerity policies of the Walker administration&quot;; and that according to the same study, Wisconsin&#x2019;s best economic year in recent times was in 2010, the year before Walker took office, when the Obama stimulus (with the help of then House Appropriations Committee chairman Dave Obey of Wisconsin) pumped billions into the state and caused a dramatic leap in job creation.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.12">Instead, the story Walker is sticking to is that because of his audacious tax and spending cuts, &quot;Wisconsin&#x2019;s back on!&quot; During his convention speech, the governor made up in self&#x2014;discipline what he lacked in raw charisma: His message was all about the economy&#x2014;&quot;that&#x2019;s the real story, not all these other side issues,&quot; he declared...which of course made me wonder at the time just what &quot;side issues&quot; he was referring to. Later that day, I asked the governor about the voter-ID law he had signed, which was now being challenged in the courts. Was this a side issue, or were there frequent occurrences of voter fraud in Wisconsin?</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.13">&quot;Some, not a lot,&quot; he readily conceded. But, he maintained, &quot;even if it&#x2019;s just one, tell me which citizen I&#x2019;m supposed to be okay with canceling out their vote because someone else is voting without legal status.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.14">Walker then added, &quot;I don&#x2019;t spend a lot of time on it.&quot; Requiring photo IDs to vote was, for him, a side issue, like the forced-ultrasound and concealed-weapon bills he signed, like the state constitutional ban on gay marriage he supported as county ecutive in 2006, and the failed lawsuit against Obamacare he requested the state attorney general to file shortly after taking the governor&#x2019;s oath of office in 2011. Side issues that wouldn&#x2019;t merit discussion during his reelection campaign in 2014. But a year later, amongst a prayerful gathering in Iowa?</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.15">That question answers itself, of course. But in so doing, it leads to another question: Is old-school culture warrior Scott Walker the Republican Party&#x2019;s solution, or is he the problem? One of Walker&#x2019;s most commendable traits is his intellectual honesty. The words he typically uses when referring to his political r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; are conservative, aggressive, reformer, bold, unintimidated, and the like. Never does he identify himself as a &quot;unifier.&quot; On the contrary, his two decades in office have been marked by bitter division. The governor now presides over a mild-mannered state bearing a deep ideological gash across its midsection. Credit him: He has done what he set out to do. He pledged to be a doer, not a healer. And in Wisconsin, Walker wins&#x2014;at least thus far.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.16">What&#x2019;s yet to be determined is whether Republicans win nationwide with someone like Scott Walker, who seemingly doubles down on the conservative positions of old and offers little to those who are repelled by the party&#x2019;s exclusionary image. Demography, as you may have heard, does not favor the Grand Old Party. Its core constituency is shrinking; the millennial generation and persons of color identify it as the party of intolerance; its leaders, including Walker&#x2019;s buddy Reince Priebus at the RNC, have spent the months following Romney&#x2019;s loss fretting over how to move past the party&#x2019;s toxic ideological rigidity while not alienating its loyal base in the process. And so I asked Priebus himself: Leaving aside how the governor&#x2019;s record would serve him well in the early primaries, did the national party chairman believe that Walker&#x2019;s stances on matters like abortion, voting regulations, and same-sex marriage would help the GOP in its attempt to reach single women, minorities, and young voters?</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.17">Priebus hesitated for a moment before he offered his game reply. &quot;Scott has figured out the secret sauce of how to win in a very difficult place,&quot; he said. &quot;I hear what you&#x2019;re saying, but it&#x2019;s not just about where the candidate stands on issues. I mean, a candidate has to be really likable and relatable. And Scott has that going for him in a big-time way.&quot; He added, &quot;On same-sex marriage, I think it&#x2019;s more of how you say it than what you say. I think Scott understands how to talk and express himself in a way that doesn&#x2019;t compromise his principles but allows himself to ercise dignity and grace.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.18"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.19">Shortly after hearing this from the RNC chairman, I got on the phone with another Wisconsinite, former governor Tommy Thompson. Most Americans know Thompson as George W. Bush&#x2019;s first secretary of health and human services, whose campaign for the presidency in 2008 clanked to a halt on the runway. In Wisconsin, however, Thompson remains a legend. He served four terms, from 1987 to 2001, and, says Milwaukee-based Democratic strategist Thad Nation, &quot;by force of his personality, Thompson just kept the state in a bipartisan cocoon. Whether you were a Democrat or a Republican, you thought Tommy was out there fighting for you.&quot; In other words, he was the opposite of Scott Walker.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.1a">I asked Thompson to compare their governing styles. &quot;Well, I&#x2019;m not being derogatory, but I was much more inclusive in that I wanted more people involved,&quot; he said. &quot;And that&#x2019;s a different style. But Walker, you know, was faced with difficult problems, and he felt the best way to deal with that was through his own counsel and his closest advisers.&quot; Should the governor decide to run for national office, Thompson said, &quot;he knows he&#x2019;s going to have to listen more&quot;&#x2014;though, he conceded, &quot;the Republican primaries don&#x2019;t dictate reaching out all that much.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.1b">And that fact was worrisome, since, Thompson said, &quot;the Republican Party is going to have to evolve. They&#x2019;re going to have to be more inclusive of divergent views&#x2014;which doesn&#x2019;t mean changing their principles, but they&#x2019;ll have to listen and moderate themselves on certain social issues&#x2014;be more cognizant of where the country is going. A Republican candidate is going to have a difficult time winning if he doesn&#x2019;t do that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.1c">Whoever that candidate might be, the 72-year-old ex-governor said, &quot;they&#x2019;ve got to be willing to stand up and say, &#x2019;This is my position. This is what I believe in, and I&#x2019;m going to stick to it. And I&#x2019;m not going to be pulled this way or that.&#x2019; The people want an honest candidate who&#x2019;s willing to stand up and say, &#x2019;This is where I believe the country should go.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.1d">It was only after we hung up that I realized what had just taken place. Tommy Thompson had, in that final remark, implicitly endorsed Walker (&quot;This is what I believe in, and I&#x2019;m going to stick to it&quot;), immediately after implicitly endorsing the very antithesis of Walker (&quot;be more inclusive of divergent views...moderate themselves on certain social issues&quot;). The man was hopelessly divided. Scott Walker had done it again.</p><p data-reactid=".86cb8u4nwg.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><a href="http://www.gq.com/about/robert-draper"><strong>Robert Draper</strong></a> <em>is </em><strong>GQ</strong><em>
