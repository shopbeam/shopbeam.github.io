It\u0027s like living with a meth dealer at your side, or a brick of cocaine in your pocket. Worse, you can get a potential high from every person you meet. But unlike other addictions, this one isn\u0027t officially recognized. There\u0027s no health coverage for it, no medication, and for those trapped in its strange and unrelenting spell, no easy way out.",

  	    "articleBody": "I. AROUSAL\u000A\u000ASEX ADDICTION— diagnosing it, treating it, portraying it on-screen—is big business. The number of certified sex-addiction therapists has more than doubled since 2008, according to the International Institute for Trauma and Addiction Professionals. Hookup apps like Tinder (26 million matches per day) and Grindr (1.6 million active daily users) are growing wildly and multiplying, like real-life manifestations of the futuristic smartphone imagined by Gary Shteyngart in Super Sad True Love Story, which rates the \u0022Fuckability\u0022 of everyone around you. The movie industry, for its part, has released at least five films on sex addiction in the past five years, six if you count both parts of Lars von Trier\u0027s Nymphomaniac. Forty years ago, the term sex addiction didn\u0027t exist. Today it is thoroughly assimilated into the culture.\u000A\u000ABut even now, sex addiction seems to exist in parallel realities: one in which millions of people are struggling with it, and another in which it is barely studied and not even clinically recognized. Research has yet to confirm that extreme sexual behavior really is addictive in the same neuroscientific sense that, for instance, habitual heroin use appears to be. For this reason, many clinicians prefer the term hypersexuality, even though they concede that the distinction is mostly semantic. But the practical effects of such uncertainty are enormous. No drugs exist to treat sex addiction; no health care plan specifically covers it; there\u0027s virtually no funding for studies. Eli Coleman, a psychologist and director of the Program in Human Sexuality at the University of Minnesota, estimates that approximately 19 million Americans—5 to 7 percent of the population—are hypersexual. But estimates like this are controversial. \u0022We\u0027re all blind in this field,\u0022 says UCLA neuroscientist Nicole Prause.\u000A\u000AThis much is certain: More and more people are seeking treatment. A lot more. In each year over the past decade, the number of groups registered with Sex Addicts Anonymous, one of the nation\u0027s largest twelve-step organizations for sex addiction, has grown by 10 percent. Hollywood is just the latest market to capitalize on this phenomenon, even if filmmakers\u0027 depictions tend to do more harm than good. On-screen, sex addiction tends to be portrayed as glamorous, even fleetingly aspirational—either posey, broody, and existential or chaotically fun in a Warren Beatty-in-the-\u002770s kind of way.\u000A\u000ABut no two-hour movie can communicate the relentless patterns of thought that persecute sex addicts. If sex is ordinarily a way of dealing with another person, then sex addiction is a way of dealing with yourself. You act out—you can\u0027t not act out—in order to escape from unbearable feelings: depression, severe ADD, bipolar disorders, the scars of family trauma, profound despair. Most addictions require you to extend yourself in some way—go to a particular place, spend a certain amount of money. Sex addiction does not. The fuel for your disease is all around you, invading your senses. The poet and professor Michael Ryan captures this experience in his unsettling, mesmerizing autobiography, Secret Life: \u0022The substance I used,\u0022 he writes, \u0022was human beings.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AJacob, age 28\u000A\u000A In recovery since 2012\u000A\u000AJACOB* IS A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER, and on the morning he greets me at the door of his and his wife\u0027s Seattle-area apartment, he looks as though he\u0027s been up all night wrestling with code. His eyes are bleary behind rimless steel glasses. His face is drained of color. But when I ask him if he\u0027s tired, he says no, just the opposite: \u0022I sleep too well. It\u0027s the only time I\u0027m able to forget everything.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn a wedding photograph on the wall, Jacob holds hands with his wife, Ashley, on a country lane. He smiles hesitantly, his eyes skittering off to one side. If you didn\u0027t know better, you might say he looks like a typical bewildered groom. But what the picture really seems to capture, and perhaps this is why he won\u0027t look directly into the lens, is Jacob at war with himself, trying to erase one terrible thought from his brain: that if his wife knew who he really was—if she knew about the pornography, the explicit online chats, the anonymous sex with other women, with random men—she would get as far away from him as she could.\u000A\u000AThey have been together for nearly half their lives. They met when they were 16, married in the fall of 2009. But they haven\u0027t had sex since June 2012, haven\u0027t even seen each other naked (except by accident) since he told her he was a sex addict. Almost every night, they separately attend meetings or therapy.\u000A\u000AAside from a few desultory wall treatments, there isn\u0027t much of a female presence in the apartment: Ikea couch and armchair, long desk by the window, computer screens. It may be that Ashley doesn\u0027t go in for decorating. It may also be that she\u0027s still not sure she\u0027s going to stay here. I\u0027d hoped to talk with Ashley today, but she and Jacob have decided against it. I get the impression that her forgiveness may be so provisional that simply facing a reporter\u0027s questions for an hour could undo it.\u000A\u000AFour pairs of running shoes, all so worn-out that they\u0027ve lost their shape and turned gray, are lined up inside the front door. In high school, Jacob was all-state three times in cross-country; he still runs six to eight miles every day and competes at least once a month in local events. He has broken this routine only when he\u0027s been lost in the stupor of his addiction.\u000A\u000AJacob grew up devoutly Christian in a remote part of a midwestern state. His father worked the late shift in a factory and typically wasn\u0027t home before eleven at night. As a kid, Jacob was shy and introverted. He dreamed of being an astronaut and walking on Mars, of his toys coming to life and being perfect friends to him.\u000A\u000AWhen I was in third grade, my teenage cousin sexually propositioned me. She wrote me detailed notes about what we would do. I went to a medical encyclopedia to see if all this stuff was real and figured out that it was. We came pretty close to having sex, but I always felt dirty about it. I pushed her away and said, \u0022I can\u0027t do this.\u0022 So we never did. But it stuck in my mind. I was preoccupied with it for a long time, fantasizing about it. My dad worked a lot, he was never around, and getting that attention felt good.\u000A\u000AWhen Jacob was in ninth grade, someone told him about Internet sex chat: It was a perfect medium for someone who had always lived best in his own mind. The first time he shared a photograph of himself with a girl—or someone who said she was a girl; it didn\u0027t really matter to him—she told him he was cute. \u0022It was intensely affirming,\u0022 he says. He spent hours at the computer, cybersexing as either a boy or a girl, whatever it took.\u000A\u000AAt the private Christian college where he studied computer science, Jacob would proxy his way around firewalls, risking expulsion to access the chat rooms. Every conversation followed the same script: \u0022Tell me where you\u0027re going to meet me,\u0022 he would demand. \u0022Tell me when. Tell me what you\u0027re going to do to me.\u0022 He would plan things out meticulously, bring people right up to the line, to the point at which they were climbing into their cars. Then he would cut off the conversation and block the person\u0027s username. If it was a particularly good chat, he might save the transcript and reread it later.\u000A\u000AThe goal is the high. It\u0027s always about the high. I\u0027d get [his eyelids flutter and his eyes roll back] light-headed. I\u0027d feel euphoric.... Orgasm was never the goal. It was always about: What can we do for as long as we can do it?\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAmy, age 44\u000A\u000A In recovery since 1998\u000A\u000A AMY HAS A GAP BETWEEN her front teeth, like Chaucer\u0027s Wife of Bath. She also has a half-dozen piercings, which she asked us not to describe for fear they would be too identifying. She lives in a ranch-style house at the end of a cul-de-sac in the Nevada desert. As we sit down in her living room, the flat-screen, tuned to a soothing New Age radio channel, is playing Enya. Amy and her partner, Patrick, a ponytailed software engineer, exchange I-love-you\u0027s. \u0022I\u0027m going to be watching my show,\u0022 he says, closing the door of their bedroom behind him. In the living room, we are surrounded by Amy\u0027s two dogs and one of her four cats.\u000A\u000AI started looking at porn when I was 7 or 8. My father\u0027s magazines: Penthouse and Hustler. They were hidden under the bed, behind the tray he used to separate the seeds from his pot. When my parents would go away, the whole ritual of pulling the magazines out and having to put them back would get me excited. It was a job to get it all right and put it back properly. I obviously couldn\u0027t have an orgasm at that young age, but I do remember a tingle. I remember thinking God gave me a special gift, that I was the only one who had these feelings.\u000A\u000AIn conversation, she doesn\u0027t flirt or, as she calls it, \u0022intrigue.\u0022 In Sex Addicts Anonymous, she has learned to avoid speech and behavior that might trigger someone else\u0027s addiction, or her own. The way she talks, the way she acts, is subdued, modulated: It\u0027s clear that she has higher gears that she won\u0027t use. It\u0027s also clear that when she did use them, years ago, she must have been magnetic.\u000A\u000AShe had sex for the first time when she was 13, on a dare.\u000A\u000AAt a party me and a girlfriend dared each other who would lose their virginity first, and I was going to win that night. My boyfriend and I were both very drunk, stumbled into a bedroom, don\u0027t know whose. He said, \u0022I can\u0027t do this, I\u0027m too drunk.\u0022 I said, \u0022You will do this.\u0022 It was not kind and loving. It was \u0022I\u0027m going to win this fucking bet.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat I should have noticed is that there was always a boyfriend. It was not okay to not have one. If I didn\u0027t have a boyfriend, what was I? I remember being in gym class after I\u0027d broken up with a guy. I said, \u0022The next guy whose shoes I like, I\u0027m going to date.\u0022 And I did.\u000A\u000AOne boyfriend had his own apartment. They could have sex there whenever they wanted. It was a kind of freedom any high school couple would envy, and it enabled her precocious discovery of the thing she liked most. She was naked in his bed one day when he pulled out a hunting knife.\u000A\u000AHe was running the knife all over. All over. I just lay there with my eyes closed. It was so titillating. And that started it.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AEdward, age 71\u000A\u000A In recovery since 2005\u000A\u000A AS HE PREPARES coffee for us, Edward has the air of awkward officiousness you sometimes see in divorced men who\u0027ve learned their way around a kitchen only in middle age. He\u0027s dressed in a kind of generic well-to-do older gentleman\u0027s casualwear: khakis, a plaid button-down shirt, white sneakers.\u000A\u000ALeather-bound volumes on medical history fill a glass-fronted bookcase. Later, I\u0027ll see a dozen framed diplomas and awards hanging in his home office. This could be your grandparents\u0027 apartment: the carpet a little thicker than usual, the furniture a little darker, heavier, more ornate. There\u0027s that downsized feeling of pieces that were never meant to be together in the same room.\u000A\u000AAs far as his neighbors know, Edward is a retired surgeon who lost most of his money in a divorce. A decade ago, he ran a network of hospitals in this Sun Belt city and lived with his wife and daughter in a 6,000-square-foot house in a tony neighborhood. He drove a new Mercedes and made $400,000 a year. Then, he says, \u0022the wheels came off my wagon.\u0022\u000A\u000AI grew up in the Deep South, in a home where the word \u0022sex\u0022 was never mentioned. I mean, you didn\u0027t even talk about what sex the dog was! But I was 30-plus years old before I engaged in any obsessive thinking or compulsive behavior.\u000A\u000AThe event that precipitated my addiction was the birth of our daughter. My wife was paying more attention to the child than to me, and I felt rejected. It was just happenstance that to avoid horrendous traffic in the city where we lived, the route I took home passed right by an adult bookstore. Bright lights, the whole bit. I wondered what goes on at those places. I picked a time when there were no other cars in the parking lot.\u000A\u000AEdward sits up straighter in his chair. His voice gets louder. Even in recovery, the vast majority of sex addicts prefer to keep their condition secret. In this regard, they\u0027re different from alcoholics and drug addicts, whose diseases tend not to be as stigmatized. The pressure of secrecy concentrates a memory, intensifying the details. These scenes, decades old, are alive for Edward.\u000A\u000AThe bookstore was brightly lighted, which was a shock. It was physically dirty. In the peep-show area, which was dark and almost creepy, there were spots of semen on the walls. As a surgeon, I was fastidious about cleanliness, and it made my flesh crawl.\u000A\u000AOn my next visit, I got a handful of quarters and went into one of the booths.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AII. MADNESS\u000A\u000ATHE BODY OF A SEX ADDICT can become his whole world. The urgent messages he receives from his brain—I\u0027m depressed, I\u0027m lonely, I\u0027m frightened, I\u0027m angry—drown out everything else around him. He can\u0027t feel happiness, except as a physical sensation.\u000A\u000AArousal and orgasm, as he knows them, are not lived experience but rather a retreat from it. They are a simulation of all that may be absent from his life: joy, intimacy, a feeling of accomplishment. They are a kind of biochemical brute-force attempt to blot out an overwhelmingly bad feeling with an overwhelmingly good one. In the space between arousal and orgasm, he finds a fleeting calm. He strives to prolong it, to escape time, escape his own mind. He lurches between wretchedness and euphoria, looping back on himself endlessly. He wants to be outside himself; instead he becomes his own prison.\u000A\u000AThe pursuit of that elusive high can drive sex addicts to escalate into increasingly risky behavior: from exhibitionism and habitual anonymous sex to, in certain cases, a fascination—even in people who have always preferred adults—with child pornography.\u000A\u000AEli Coleman, who has studied this phenomenon, says that some of these men are working out conflicts about their sexuality. But some are not. Instead, he says, they may have other, intricately tangled motives: to express self-hatred through behavior they may regard as debasing, to subjugate a partner they regard as more physically powerful than a woman, to feel desired by and intimate with a father who was emotionally distant.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AJacob\u000A\u000A I WOULD MAKE THESE pacts with myself: I\u0027m going to stop. It would last a day or two and I\u0027d be back at it again. I was acting out with other people, or porn, or masturbation, almost daily. At first there was a baseline level of attractiveness I needed, but later on, it was just anybody and everybody who could and would. I would look for people who I perceived could not get sex because of their looks, their age, or their body size, because I thought those people would be more available.\u000A\u000AThe first guy, I met him on Craigslist my junior year. I remember going over to a seedy little apartment. He was a couple of years older than me, and he was actually a cross-dresser. He asked me if I wanted him to cross-dress for me, and I said no. Not a lot happened that first time. I got some oral sex but didn\u0027t have an orgasm. It was really awkward. I buried that experience from everybody because I was so ashamed. I\u0027ve never really found myself attracted to men. It was truly the most convenient, expedient way for me to get sex, so I took it.\u000A\u000AJacob would scrupulously research prospective partners: \u0022Not that it ever fazed me, but you hear the stories about people getting murdered or killed or whatever online.\u0022 If he couldn\u0027t document a person\u0027s real-life identity, he wouldn\u0027t meet them. He began writing a program for a kind of \u0022dead-man\u0027s switch,\u0022 a piece of software that, if he didn\u0027t log in within a prescribed period of time, would e-mail to friends the last street address he\u0027d visited.\u000A\u000AThe month before I got engaged to Ashley, I went to see a much older woman, probably forties, who was just looking for sex with a younger guy. I had unprotected sex with her. That was the first time in my life that I had ever had intercourse. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever felt despair like that in my whole life. I remember driving home just screaming, because I knew that I had just destroyed my relationship with my girlfriend. She\u0027s not going to stick around with a guy who\u0027s done this. So there in that car that night, I told myself, \u0022I have to bury it so deep and so far down that no one ever finds it.\u0022 That really was the fuel, the catalyst, that kept my fire burning long after that.\u000A\u000AI can\u0027t say that I believed marriage would save me, but I tried to live in this naive little world. Did my wife fulfill me? No, she didn\u0027t. I honestly don\u0027t think that she could\u0027ve.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAmy\u000A\u000A I WOULD BE PREDATORY. They were meat, and I was eating that night. I didn\u0027t even need to know their names. It was just the nearest available person who showed interest. I pretty much got what I wanted back then.\u000A\u000AI would have sex with people that I normally wouldn\u0027t shake their hand. I had no respect for them. When I was in extreme arousal, my threshold for pain was different. There were times with the S&amp;M stuff when I felt powerful, in that I could get nice guys to do things to me that they didn\u0027t want to do, things that were against their values. That was pleasurable.\u000A\u000ASo the knife became more fun, and I wanted to be cut.\u000A\u000AYou would bleed? I ask her.\u000A\u000AYes. My back is where I liked it.\u000A\u000AWhat was the most extreme thing you coerced someone into doing to you?\u000A\u000AI particularly remember one man crying afterward.\u000A\u000AAfter being made to do what?\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t want to say. Things that felt good at the moment. Things I\u0027m terribly ashamed of.\u000A\u000AAmy was popular in high school, she was a cheerleader. But none of it was enough. She developed an eating disorder, then began using cocaine to suppress her appetite. Eventually she was freebasing. At 19, she went into drug and alcohol rehab, where clinicians raised a separate concern: It was highly unusual, they said, for someone so young to have developed a taste for sadomasochistic sex. They recommended she go to Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings.\u000A\u000AA group of us from meetings used to go out to a bar and dance. Then I became a little groupie and started dating the lead singer of the house band, who had a daughter a year younger than me. That was Richard, the father of my first child. When I broke up with him, I already had the next guy in sight and was with him when I gave birth. Scott: teardrop tattoo, Levi\u0027s, big boots. Construction worker. Yeah, it was like a porn. He was the father of my second child.\u000A\u000AI was not a good parent. I lost my temper more than I might have, had I gotten a good night\u0027s sleep and not masturbated to porn all night. Like, \u0022How is the sun possibly coming up right now? I just put the kids to bed.\u0022\u000A\u000AI would leave my children with anyone who would watch them so that I could go act out with whoever I was seeing at the time. When it was time to pick them up, I would call with an excuse, or I wouldn\u0027t call at all. Finally they threatened to take my children away.\u000A\u000AI never got into anything illegal, child pornography or anything, thank goodness. But I was aroused by snuff films. That was one of those things I would only tell my sponsor. The ones I was watching were probably fake, but I think I saw one real one. I would identify with the woman in them. It\u0027s rape. She\u0027s usually been kidnapped. They\u0027re planning on killing her.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AEdward\u000A\u000A AT TIMES, RECALLING the indignities he subjected himself to at adult bookstores, Edward laughs exactly as you might if you were telling a story about the time you drank too much in college. His laughter mis disbelief, self-loathing, and a peculiar kind of nostalgia.\u000A\u000AThe big leap was a booth that had a hole between it and the booth next to it. Somebody came into the booth next door and motioned to me through the hole. That was the first time I realized what the holes were for. I freaked out and left.\u000A\u000ABut the next time I returned, I chose a booth with a hole in it. The other person gave me a blow job. The glory holes are just: I don\u0027t want anything to do with this person, I just want a sexual event and to be done with it. This is part of the shame: I don\u0027t want to be a creep who does this. Hello! I\u0027m a creep who does this!\u000A\u000AIt must be flattering when someone listens attentively to your life story, no matter how grim it may be, but Edward seems to take a private enjoyment in reliving the past. It\u0027s clear that on some level, these are happy memories for him. As far as anyone knew back then, he was \u0022the ideal father, husband, church member, and surgeon,\u0022 he says. Even now, the pleasure of describing those days seems to make him forget, temporarily, how catastrophically they ended.\u000A\u000AOn a couple of social occasions, I ran into guys I had had sex with. That was terrifying. Can you imagine? You\u0027re in somebody\u0027s lovely home for a cocktail party. You\u0027re with your wife, and he\u0027s with his wife. You act like you\u0027re old friends from way back. You go into performance mode. The mask.\u000A\u000APerformance mode: Several times during the interview, Edward\u0027s phone rings. In exactly the same courtly, affable drawl with which he has been describing anonymous sex at adult bookstores, he says, \u0022Oh, hi. I\u0027m in a meeting. Can I call you back?\u0022\u000A\u000AIn 2003, I chatted online with a couple of guys who said they were 14. I agreed to meet one. I was morbidly curious. You wonder if this is a real person and, if so, what\u0027s going on that a 14-year-old wants to do this. So I arranged to meet this person. He supposedly lived nearby. I drove out and parked. Nobody showed up, and I left.\u000A\u000AThat was a Thursday, and mid-afternoon Friday at the clinic, somebody came and said someone had bumped my car in the parking lot; could I please come out there? I walked out the back door of the building, and it was an FBI agent. They already had all my chat logs. They had pictures of me. There was no denying it. I resigned on the spot.\u000A\u000AMy daughter found out right away. It was like, \u0022So this is who you are.\u0022 She didn\u0027t talk to me for ten years. I was so devastated and so terrified of publicity that I agreed to plead guilty, which I should not have, in retrospect. The FBI seized all my computers and went through them, and they found nothing that indicated child pornography. The case hinged on intent, not an act. I was charged with solicitation of a minor, and I spent a year in federal prison.\u000A\u000AMy wife filed for divorce, and I granted it, no contest. I gave her 80 percent of everything I had. Now I wish I\u0027d not done it, because she got remarried to a bad guy, a con artist who apparently preyed on well-to-do women, and he basically stole about half a million dollars from her. It\u0027s just a family fiasco. Occasionally I get really depressed that I caused it all.\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve never been sexually attracted to children. But let\u0027s say a 14-year-old had showed up that day, and he was a cute kid, and he was relatively mature for his age... I cannot honestly say that I would not have pursued it further. I mean, I\u0027m a sex addict. There\u0027s very few things that I could say, I would not do that, period, ever.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIII. TREATMENT\u000A\u000AIN 2010, A GROUP led by Harvard psychiatrist Martin Kafka pushed hard for the inclusion of hypersexual disorder in the DSM, the bible of psychiatric diagnoses, which was about to be updated for the first time in two decades. Kafka\u0027s pitch cited epidemiological data and case studies from nearly 250 books and journal articles, including twenty he had co-authored. But by his own admission, knowledge about the condition still had \u0022significant gaps and shortcomings.\u0022 The DSM task force flatly rejected Kafka\u0027s proposal. (Meanwhile, they did see fit to approve fifteen new diagnoses, including skin-picking disorder.)\u000A\u000A\u0022There may have been political reasons for this,\u0022 says Kafka today. In particular, there was reluctance to equate any kind of consensual sexual behavior with mental illness. (The psychiatric establishment had been through this before: Its long-standing classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder—rescinded only in 1973—caused incalculable harm to gay people and badly damaged the field\u0027s reputation.) There was also some concern that an official diagnosis might provide a kind of loophole for people accused of sex crimes. Says Kafka: \u0022The difference between where is normal and where is abnormal: Where do you draw that line? How do you draw a line like that?\u0022\u000A\u000AThe consequences of exclusion from the DSM were enormous: Inclusion would have meant that health-insurance companies might cover the costs of treatment; that the government, which has provided virtually no money for sex-addiction research, might take an interest in it; that pharmaceutical companies might try to develop medications for it. The study of sex addiction is caught in its own vicious cycle: no funding, no research; no DSM diagnosis, no funding.\u000A\u000ATo fill the treatment void, experienced therapists endorse a combination of one-on-one therapy, medication (usually antidepressants), and a twelve-step program, the last of which seems to provide practical coping strategies and relief from shame. There\u0027s no data whatsoever on the effectiveness of residential rehabs, where treatment can cost tens of thousands of dollars.\u000A\u000AWhen a sex addict is married, recovery becomes more complicated by orders of magnitude. Some therapists will guide couples through a process known as disclosure: a controlled accounting by the sex addict, for the partner, of all the secretive behaviors he or she has ever engaged in. It\u0027s not uncommon for sex addicts to take a polygraph test at their partner\u0027s insistence, says Jenner Bishop, an Oakland sex-addiction therapist. The goal is to re-establish trust and to teach the addict how to have sex that isn\u0027t compulsive and selfish. \u0022The partner has to have a lot of their hypervigilance and trauma soothed,\u0022 says Bishop. \u0022The irony is, it\u0027s by someone who\u0027s typically too narcissistic to come up with the empathy to do it.\u0022\u000A\u000AHow often does a marriage survive sex addiction? Not very often, you\u0027d think. Says Kafka, \u0022A lot of these relationships end up either taking a very long time to recover—like, years—or never do.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AJacob\u000A\u000A JACOB CONTEMPLATED killing himself, but never stopped going to church. One day, the pastor delivered a sermon on guilt and shame. Guilt: I have done bad things. Shame: I am bad. The sermon, Jacob says, \u0022just broke me.\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027d look at myself in the mirror and think, \u0022What a piece of trash. My face is a lie. Everything about me is a lie.\u0022 I spent the rest of the month kicking and screaming against what I had to do.\u000A\u000AWe sat on the couch, and I told Ashley everything I could think of. She was actually glad that I had told her rather than her finding it. She said she didn\u0027t know what she was going to do. She was concerned that I might be gay. I told her I would be honest about it if I were attracted to men. I\u0027ve always felt it was about the power dynamic, about being desired.\u000A\u000AAshley was furious with him, Jacob says, but she has expressed those feelings only in therapy sessions or in her journal. Why does Ashley need to go to a twelve-step group? I ask. \u0022Ashley got hit by a truck. I was the driver,\u0022 Jacob says, a bit automatically. \u0022She\u0027s getting help so she\u0027ll never get hit by a truck again.\u0022 The agreement is that if he ever acts out with another person, she leaves.\u000A\u000AWe decided that we needed to take a break from having sex until we know if this can even be stopped or controlled. The crux of my life is: How do you transition from a point where it\u0027s all about me? That\u0027s what I want to be. I want to be an authentic guy.\u000A\u000AMost nights, Jacob and Ashley see each other for an hour or so. At the suggestion of their therapists, they do a \u0022daily share\u0022 in which they affirm something they appreciate about the other, recount an event from their day, make a request, and describe what\u0027s generally on their minds. It can seem as though they\u0027re spending so much time repairing their relationship that they no longer really have one.\u000A\u000AFor Ashley, these trials are a test of her faith—in God and in Jacob. She trusts that her faith will be rewarded. She and Jacob have no children, no money, no valuable material possessions. They have this.*\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAmy\u000A\u000ADURING THE TWO hours that Amy and I have been talking, her two dogs, a graying Lab and a gentle German shepherd, have not stopped pressing us to pet them.\u000A\u000AI once did something sexual with a dog. I just remember holding it, it trying to get away, and having that control of it against its will. I thought I\u0027d go to the grave with this behavior. I\u0027m terribly ashamed of it. Now I say it at meetings, just because other people have done it, and I want them to know they\u0027re not alone. Obviously I have made my amends to animals.\u000A\u000AAmy scrutinizes her sons\u0027 behavior for any sign that they might be like her. When she caught them masturbating as teenagers, as mothers are apt to do, she tried to check her anxiety. \u0022This is absolutely normal,\u0022 she told them, before blurting out, \u0022My fear is that you\u0027re not going to be able to stop!\u0022 Sometimes she discovered porn magazines in their rooms.\u000A\u000AWhen I found [my son\u0027s] porn, I friggin\u0027 lost it. One, I\u0027m in recovery, and I can\u0027t have porn in my house. Two, I\u0027m terrified he\u0027s going to get addicted. So I would destroy it over and over. I know that he knows if he\u0027s got a problem, there\u0027s a solution. I do the health fairs where I sit at a table: sex addicts anonymous. I\u0027m sure that\u0027s embarrassing, to have your mom do that, but I\u0027m the mom who does that.\u000A\u000AI met Patrick in SAA, and I\u0027ve been with him for two and a half years. We are in a loving relationship. We pray before we start having sex, or check in. Because either of us can go off into fantasy. Like, in my head I\u0027m in a porn.\u000A\u000AI used to say that addictive sex is like fireworks, and healthy sex is like sparklers. It just burns less brightly. It\u0027s not really what I want, but it\u0027s the best thing for me.\u000A\u000A*In the time since this story was originally reported, Jacob and Ashley have gotten divorced, and Amy and Patrick have gotten married.\u000A\u000AExcluding those of medical experts, all names and some identifying details have been changed.\u000A\u000ANathaniel Penn (@natepenn) is a   GQ correspondent.",

and frictionless-dating apps, sex addiction is like being hooked on a drug that&#39;s always available in unlimited supply. It&#39;s like living with a meth dealer at your side, or a brick of cocaine in your pocket. Worse, you can get a potential high from every person you meet. But unlike other addictions, this one isn&#39;t officially recognized. There&#39;s no health coverage for it, no medication, and for those trapped in its strange and unrelenting spell, no easy way out.</h2><div class="byline-top-flex" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3"><div class="grid" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0"><div class="row" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0"><div class="col col-sm-15" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0"><div class="component-byline byline single avatars" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0"><div class="byline-item" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author"><div class="component-contributor" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author.1:$0"><span class="byline-label" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author.1:$0.1">By </span><a class="byline-contributor-link" rel="author" href="../contributor/nathaniel-penn" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author.1:$0.2">Nathaniel Penn</a></div></div><time class="publish-date" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.1">April 21, 2015 8:00 pm</time></div></div><div class="col col-sm-5" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1"><div class="social-share-top" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0"><div class="component-social-share default" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-sex&amp;t=Inside%20the%20Real%20Lives%20of%20Sex%20Addicts" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-sex&amp;t=Inside%20the%20Real%20Lives%20of%20Sex%20Addicts" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook.0"><span class="icon" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook.0.0"></span><span class="label" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook.0.1">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item twitter" data-href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Inside%20the%20Real%20Lives%20of%20Sex%20Addicts&amp;via=GQMagazine&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-sex" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Inside%20the%20Real%20Lives%20of%20Sex%20Addicts&amp;via=GQMagazine&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-sex" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter.0"><span class="icon" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter.0.0"></span><span class="label" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter.0.1">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.0"><h2>I. AROUSAL</h2></div><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.1">SEX ADDICTION&#x2014; diagnosing it, treating it, portraying it on-screen&#x2014;is big business. The number of certified sex-addiction therapists has more than doubled since 2008, according to the International Institute for Trauma and Addiction Professionals. Hookup apps like Tinder (26 million matches per day) and Grindr (1.6 million active daily users) are growing wildly and multiplying, like real-life manifestations of the futuristic smartphone imagined by Gary Shteyngart in <em>Super Sad True Love Story,</em> which rates the &quot;Fuckability&quot; of everyone around you. The movie industry, for its part, has released at least five films on sex addiction in the past five years, six if you count both parts of Lars von Trier&#x2019;s <em>Nymphomaniac</em>. Forty years ago, the term <em>sex addiction</em> didn&#x2019;t exist. Today it is thoroughly assimilated into the culture.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.2">But even now, sex addiction seems to exist in parallel realities: one in which millions of people are struggling with it, and another in which it is barely studied and not even clinically recognized. Research has yet to confirm that extreme sexual behavior really is addictive in the same neuroscientific sense that, for instance, habitual heroin use appears to be. For this reason, many clinicians prefer the term <em>hypersexuality,</em> even though they concede that the distinction is mostly semantic. But the practical effects of such uncertainty are enormous. No drugs exist to treat sex addiction; no health care plan specifically covers it; there&#x2019;s virtually no funding for studies. Eli Coleman, a psychologist and director of the Program in Human Sexuality at the University of Minnesota, estimates that approximately 19 million Americans&#x2014;5 to 7 percent of the population&#x2014;are hypersexual. But estimates like this are controversial. &quot;We&#x2019;re all blind in this field,&quot; says UCLA neuroscientist Nicole Prause.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.3">This much is certain: More and more people are seeking treatment. A lot more. In each year over the past decade, the number of groups registered with Sex Addicts Anonymous, one of the nation&#x2019;s largest twelve-step organizations for sex addiction, has grown by 10 percent. Hollywood is just the latest market to capitalize on this phenomenon, even if filmmakers&#x2019; depictions tend to do more harm than good. On-screen, sex addiction tends to be portrayed as glamorous, even fleetingly aspirational&#x2014;either posey, broody, and existential or chaotically fun in a Warren Beatty-in-the-&#x2019;70s kind of way.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.5">But no two-hour movie can communicate the relentless patterns of thought that persecute sex addicts. If sex is ordinarily a way of dealing with another person, then sex addiction is a way of dealing with yourself. You act out&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t <em>not</em> act out&#x2014;in order to escape from unbearable feelings: depression, severe ADD, bipolar disorders, the scars of family trauma, profound despair. Most addictions require you to extend yourself in some way&#x2014;go to a particular place, spend a certain amount of money. Sex addiction does not. The fuel for your disease is all around you, invading your senses. The poet and professor Michael Ryan captures this experience in his unsettling, mesmerizing autobiography, <em>Secret Life:</em> &quot;The substance I used,&quot; he writes, &quot;was human beings.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.6"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582f65509f0bee56440ab26/master/w_806/life-2015-04-sex-addiction-06.jpg" alt="life-2015-04-sex-addiction-06.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-sex&amp;t=life-2015-04-sex-addiction-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-sex&amp;t=life-2015-04-sex-addiction-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-sex&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f65509f0bee56440ab26%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-04-sex-addiction-06.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-04-sex-addiction-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-sex&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f65509f0bee56440ab26%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-04-sex-addiction-06.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-04-sex-addiction-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Jacob, age 28</strong></p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong> In recovery since 2012</strong></p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.9">JACOB* IS A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER, and on the morning he greets me at the door of his and his wife&#x2019;s Seattle-area apartment, he looks as though he&#x2019;s been up all night wrestling with code. His eyes are bleary behind rimless steel glasses. His face is drained of color. But when I ask him if he&#x2019;s tired, he says no, just the opposite: &quot;I sleep <em>too</em> well. It&#x2019;s the only time I&#x2019;m able to forget everything.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.a">In a wedding photograph on the wall, Jacob holds hands with his wife, Ashley, on a country lane. He smiles hesitantly, his eyes skittering off to one side. If you didn&#x2019;t know better, you might say he looks like a typical bewildered groom. But what the picture really seems to capture, and perhaps this is why he won&#x2019;t look directly into the lens, is Jacob at war with himself, trying to erase one terrible thought from his brain: that if his wife knew who he really was&#x2014;if she knew about the pornography, the explicit online chats, the anonymous sex with other women, with random men&#x2014;she would get as far away from him as she could.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.b">They have been together for nearly half their lives. They met when they were 16, married in the fall of 2009. But they haven&#x2019;t had sex since June 2012, haven&#x2019;t even seen each other naked (except by accident) since he told her he was a sex addict. Almost every night, they separately attend meetings or therapy.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.c">Aside from a few desultory wall treatments, there isn&#x2019;t much of a female presence in the apartment: Ikea couch and armchair, long desk by the window, computer screens. It may be that Ashley doesn&#x2019;t go in for decorating. It may also be that she&#x2019;s still not sure she&#x2019;s going to stay here. I&#x2019;d hoped to talk with Ashley today, but she and Jacob have decided against it. I get the impression that her forgiveness may be so provisional that simply facing a reporter&#x2019;s questions for an hour could undo it.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.d">Four pairs of running shoes, all so worn-out that they&#x2019;ve lost their shape and turned gray, are lined up inside the front door. In high school, Jacob was all-state three times in cross-country; he still runs six to eight miles every day and competes at least once a month in local events. He has broken this routine only when he&#x2019;s been lost in the stupor of his addiction.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.e">Jacob grew up devoutly Christian in a remote part of a midwestern state. His father worked the late shift in a factory and typically wasn&#x2019;t home before eleven at night. As a kid, Jacob was shy and introverted. He dreamed of being an astronaut and walking on Mars, of his toys coming to life and being perfect friends to him.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.f"><em>When I was in third grade, my teenage cousin sexually propositioned me. She wrote me detailed notes about what we would do. I went to a medical encyclopedia to see if all this stuff was real and figured out that it was. We came pretty close to having sex, but I always felt dirty about it. I pushed her away and said, &quot;I can&#x2019;t do this.&quot; So we never did. But it stuck in my mind. I was preoccupied with it for a long time, fantasizing about it. My dad worked a lot, he was never around, and getting that attention felt good.</em></p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.g">When Jacob was in ninth grade, someone told him about Internet sex chat: It was a perfect medium for someone who had always lived best in his own mind. The first time he shared a photograph of himself with a girl&#x2014;or someone who said she was a girl; it didn&#x2019;t really matter to him&#x2014;she told him he was cute. &quot;It was intensely affirming,&quot; he says. He spent hours at the computer, cybersexing as either a boy or a girl, whatever it took.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.h">At the private Christian college where he studied computer science, Jacob would proxy his way around firewalls, risking expulsion to access the chat rooms. Every conversation followed the same script: &quot;Tell me where you&#x2019;re going to meet me,&quot; he would demand. &quot;Tell me when. Tell me what you&#x2019;re going to do to me.&quot; He would plan things out meticulously, bring people right up to the line, to the point at which they were climbing into their cars. Then he would cut off the conversation and block the person&#x2019;s username. If it was a particularly good chat, he might save the transcript and reread it later.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.i"><em>The goal is the high. It&#x2019;s always about the high. I&#x2019;d get</em> [his eyelids flutter and his eyes roll back] <em>light-headed. I&#x2019;d feel euphoric.... Orgasm was never the goal.

She also has a half-dozen piercings, which she asked us not to describe for fear they would be too identifying. She lives in a ranch-style house at the end of a cul-de-sac in the Nevada desert. As we sit down in her living room, the flat-screen, tuned to a soothing New Age radio channel, is playing Enya. Amy and her partner, Patrick, a ponytailed software engineer, exchange I-love-you&#x2019;s. &quot;I&#x2019;m going to be watching my show,&quot; he says, closing the door of their bedroom behind him.

I obviously couldn&#x2019;t have an orgasm at that young age, but I do remember a tingle. I remember thinking God gave me a special gift, that I was the only one who had these feelings.</em></p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.o">In conversation, she doesn&#x2019;t flirt or, as she calls it, &quot;intrigue.&quot; In Sex Addicts Anonymous, she has learned to avoid speech and behavior that might trigger someone else&#x2019;s addiction, or her own. The way she talks, the way she acts, is subdued, modulated: It&#x2019;s clear that she has higher gears that she won&#x2019;t use. It&#x2019;s also clear that when she did use them, years ago, she must have been magnetic.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.p">She had sex for the first time when she was 13, on a dare.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.q"><em>At a party me and a girlfriend dared each other who would lose their virginity first, and I was going to win that night.

Later, I&#x2019;ll see a dozen framed diplomas and awards hanging in his home office. This could be your grandparents&#x2019; apartment: the carpet a little thicker than usual, the furniture a little darker, heavier, more ornate. There&#x2019;s that downsized feeling of pieces that were never meant to be together in the same room.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.z">As far as his neighbors know, Edward is a retired surgeon who lost most of his money in a divorce. A decade ago, he ran a network of hospitals in this Sun Belt city and lived with his wife and daughter in a 6,000-square-foot house in a tony neighborhood. He drove a new Mercedes and made $400,000 a year. Then, he says, &quot;the wheels came off my wagon.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.10"><em>I grew up in the Deep South, in a home where the word &quot;sex&quot; was never mentioned.

His voice gets louder. Even in recovery, the vast majority of sex addicts prefer to keep their condition secret. In this regard, they&#x2019;re different from alcoholics and drug addicts, whose diseases tend not to be as stigmatized. The pressure of secrecy concentrates a memory, intensifying the details. These scenes, decades old, are alive for Edward.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.13"><em>The bookstore was brightly lighted, which was a shock. It was physically dirty.

They are a simulation of all that may be absent from his life: joy, intimacy, a feeling of accomplishment. They are a kind of biochemical brute-force attempt to blot out an overwhelmingly bad feeling with an overwhelmingly good one. In the space between arousal and orgasm, he finds a fleeting calm.

TREATMENT</h2></div><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.2d">IN 2010, A GROUP led by Harvard psychiatrist Martin Kafka pushed hard for the inclusion of hypersexual disorder in the <em>DSM,</em> the bible of psychiatric diagnoses, which was about to be updated for the first time in two decades. Kafka&#x2019;s pitch cited epidemiological data and case studies from nearly 250 books and journal articles, including twenty he had co-authored. But by his own admission, knowledge about the condition still had &quot;significant gaps and shortcomings.&quot; The <em>DSM</em> task force flatly rejected Kafka&#x2019;s proposal. (Meanwhile, they did see fit to approve fifteen new diagnoses, including skin-picking disorder.)</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.2e">&quot;There may have been political reasons for this,&quot; says Kafka today. In particular, there was reluctance to equate any kind of consensual sexual behavior with mental illness. (The psychiatric establishment had been through this before: Its long-standing classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder&#x2014;rescinded only in 1973&#x2014;caused incalculable harm to gay people and badly damaged the field&#x2019;s reputation.) There was also some concern that an official diagnosis might provide a kind of loophole for people accused of sex crimes. Says Kafka: &quot;The difference between where is normal and where is abnormal: Where do you draw that line? How do you draw a line like that?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.2f">The consequences of exclusion from the <em>DSM</em> were enormous: Inclusion would have meant that health-insurance companies might cover the costs of treatment; that the government, which has provided virtually no money for sex-addiction research, might take an interest in it; that pharmaceutical companies might try to develop medications for it. The study of sex addiction is caught in its own vicious cycle: no funding, no research; no <em>DSM</em> diagnosis, no funding.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.2g">To fill the treatment void, experienced therapists endorse a combination of one-on-one therapy, medication (usually antidepressants), and a twelve-step program, the last of which seems to provide practical coping strategies and relief from shame. There&#x2019;s no data whatsoever on the effectiveness of residential rehabs, where treatment can cost tens of thousands of dollars.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.2h">When a sex addict is married, recovery becomes more complicated by orders of magnitude. Some therapists will guide couples through a process known as disclosure: a controlled accounting by the sex addict, for the partner, of all the secretive behaviors he or she has ever engaged in. It&#x2019;s not uncommon for sex addicts to take a polygraph test at their partner&#x2019;s insistence, says Jenner Bishop, an Oakland sex-addiction therapist. The goal is to re-establish trust and to teach the addict how to have sex that isn&#x2019;t compulsive and selfish. &quot;The partner has to have a lot of their hypervigilance and trauma soothed,&quot; says Bishop. &quot;The irony is, it&#x2019;s by someone who&#x2019;s typically too narcissistic to come up with the empathy to do it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.2i">How often does a marriage survive sex addiction? Not very often, you&#x2019;d think. Says Kafka, &quot;A lot of these relationships end up either taking a very long time to recover&#x2014;like, years&#x2014;or never do.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.2j"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.2k"><strong>Jacob</strong></p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.2l"> JACOB CONTEMPLATED killing himself, but never stopped going to church.

Why does Ashley need to go to a twelve-step group? I ask. &quot;Ashley got hit by a truck. I was the driver,&quot; Jacob says, a bit automatically. &quot;She&#x2019;s getting help so she&#x2019;ll never get hit by a truck again.&quot; The agreement is that if he ever acts out with another person, she leaves.</p><p data-reactid=".214tx2urg1s.1.1.0.0.4.2p"><em>We decided that we needed to take a break from having sex until we know if this can even be stopped or controlled.
