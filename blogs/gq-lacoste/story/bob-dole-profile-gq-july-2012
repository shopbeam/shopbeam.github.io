  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A It occurs to me, sitting in a stately law office with Bob Dole, that Bob Dole is the exact opposite of so many of the politicians we talk about these days—especially the animatronic, polished Mitt Romney, who tries so achingly hard to be real, to be authentic, to be someone like, well, Bob Dole. \u000A\u000A Dole materialized last winter and entered the national conversation as one of the first Republicans anyone takes seriously to endorse Mitt Romney. (Wait, Bob Dole is still alive?) In a letter to The Des Moines Register, he offered an explicit and unanticipated reality check, becoming the lone conservative to actually say something, politely, about the invasion of the GOP weirdos into the campaign.\u000A\u000A Bob Dole. \u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m still here!\u0022 he says to me.\u000A\u000A Bob Dole?\u000A\u000A Aw, Bob Dole. \u000A\u000A I ask him the question everyone seems to be asking of the GOP faithful in 2012: \u0022Would you say your endorsement of Romney was...tepid?\u0022 \u000A\u000A \u0022Not tepid at all,\u0022 Bob Dole says, his face tight and serious.\u000A\u000A There\u0027s a spritely young flack sitting behind me and another one in a chair to my left, and so it is me and Bob Dole doing a show together, which apparently is what makes Bob Dole comfortable. \u0022Romney came to my office,\u0022 Dole says, \u0022we had a good meeting, and I\u0027m not a Gingrich fan, so...\u0022 He famously loathed Gingrich: \u0022He\u0027s just difficult to work with. It\u0027s either Newt\u0027s way or the highway. He\u0027s got a lot of ideas. Some of them are good; not many. So it looked to me like it would be either Romney or Newt for the nomination, but just on its own, I thought he—well, I\u0027ll say this: Romney looks like a president.\u0022 \u000A\u000A It\u0027s always discomfiting to listen to people try to conjure any serious oomph when taking about Romney, and this moment is no exception. I make the point that Mitt Romney\u0027s background is different from Bob Dole\u0027s. \u0022You\u0027re self-made,\u0022 I say. \u0022You embody the American Dream.\u0022 \u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027ve never known a lot of rich people,\u0022 he says. \u0022It\u0027s not my bag.\u0022\u000A\u000A His bag, even at 88, is to dress in a suit each day and show up at the law firm on F Street in Washington, D.C., grand and formal where dressy people are busy and hushed. He seems propped behind his big walnut desk, his soft body slumped like an infant\u0027s in a high chair, his chin lowered over the knot of his polka-dot tie, trousers hiked high. He\u0027s wearing a crisp white shirt, and his thin hair is combed into obedient stripes. A fresh cotton ball taped over paper-thin skin on the back of his hand suggests hospital matters not quite resolved. \u000A\u000A I ask him how he sizes up President Obama.\u000A\u000A \u0022He\u0027s a nice person. I have a good relationship with the White House, I just think he\u0027s totally out of step. We\u0027re moving farther to the left, and it may not be as bad as some people say, but we\u0027ve got to cut spending. One of these days, we\u0027ll probably have to raise tas. I just think his philosophy is too far to the left.\u0022\u000A\u000A He blinks softly, not moving much else at all. His mind is clear. Sharp. But his body. It\u0027s as if his big blocky head were not attached to the dwindling rest of him. I ask about some of the central concerns of the campaign—income inequality, negative ads, health care, gay marriage—and while he appears engaged by the questions, he lacks the zeal to offer more than the \u0022one man, one woman,\u0022 \u0022reduce spending\u0022 party lines. His fuller thoughts lie elsewhere. He is an old man with old-man stuff going on in his head: back-in-the-day, and good golly, all those great guys and gals stomping through his time here on earth, so many more to hurry up and meet. \u000A\u000A \u0022Bill Clinton called me one day recently,\u0022 he offers. \u0022I said, \u0027What do you want?\u0027 He said, \u0027I want to see how you\u0027re doing. How\u0027s your health?\u0027 He\u0027s done that a couple times. If I did anything, I made a lot of friends. And they were Republicans, of course, and Democrats.\u0022 Clinton would help Dole deal with Gingrich. \u0022I\u0027m not going to talk to him, you talk to him,\u0022 Dole, as Senate majority leader, would say to Clinton. \u0022No, you talk to him.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022President Obama came to visit me in the hospital. He said, \u0027I wish you were still in the Senate; I need your help.\u0027 I\u0027m not certain I can help on everything. Maybe some things.\u0022\u000A\u000A Bob Dole doesn\u0027t kid himself. He knows what he\u0027s good at (getting laughs, getting things done). He championed causes today\u0027s conservatives run full campaigns against—civil rights, food stamps, benefits for the disabled. And Bob Dole knows what he\u0027s bad at (winning really big elections). He lost the vice presidency to Mondale in 1976 and then the presidency to Clinton in 1996. He even wears failure with a candor that seems lacking in Washington these days. \u000A\u000A \u0022I don\u0027t know how many people run for vice president and president and lose both,\u0022 Bob Dole says, turning to his aides. \u0022I think there\u0027s one other?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022You\u0027re testing my history on that one, sir. It would have been...\u0022\u000A\u000A Dole: \u0022Anybody?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Lost both vice president and president? Um...\u0022\u000A\u000A Dole: \u0022Somebody said there was someone—other than me?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022You have to go back pretty far, I just, I don\u0027t think—\u0022\u000A\u000A Nobody can come up with one. \u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000A Said a fake Bob Dole with a big yellow head on The Simpsons: \u0022Maybe Bob Dole should run. Bob Dole thinks Bob Dole should.\u0022 Said a fake snoozing Bob Dole in a short red tie on Family Guy: \u0022Bob Dole is a friend of the tobacco industry. Bob Dole likes your style. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole. Bob Dole.\u0022 \u000A\u000A You can\u0027t think \u0022Dole\u0022 without thinking \u0022Bob Dole,\u0022 and cartoons and third-person good times. He was one of those politicians, the kind you jabbed but were happy enough to have around. His politics were plenty conservative—and yet by today\u0027s standards seem almost quaint. Bob Dole. He\u0027s like the neighbors\u0027 Labrador retriever your dad used to curse for all that barking, all that darn digging in your mom\u0027s tulip bed, and now look, you live next door to a godforsaken pack of teeth-baring rabid Pomeranians, and, good golly, Bob Dole!\u000A\u000A When we met, he had his signature blue Flair pen in his right hand and an extra one anchored in his shirt pocket. He has always had the pen there, to keep his fingers from curling into a fist; as a side benefit, it reminds people not to reach out to shake his right hand, because he can\u0027t.\u000A\u000A \u0022Always have time for the daughter of a World War II serviceman,\u0022 he said to me when we first met. It wasn\u0027t how I\u0027d ever thought of defining myself, and I didn\u0027t remember mentioning any of that stuff to his people, so it caught me off guard. \u000A\u000A \u0022Oh, the war,\u0022 I said, awkwardly. \u0022Oh, my dad sure was proud of that...war.\u0022 \u000A\u000A \u0022Navy?\u0022 Bob Dole said, and I nodded. \u0022And he\u0027s still...?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022He died last year.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I see.\u0022\u000A\u000A It was a lot to cover in the first fourteen seconds of meeting anyone; Bob Dole goes right for the patriotism jugular. His service in World War II is almost certainly how he defines himself, even though he spent much of his public life hiding the wounds: right shoulder, arm, hand. He was never one to use the story to further his image, hardly even talked about the whole mess until recently in a memoir. \u000A\u000A He was an athlete. He was a poor kid from rural Kansas—Depression, Dust Bowl, his parents moving the family to the basement to rent out the upstairs for money. He was a good kid, honors, played football, a basketball hero, gorgeous young man the girls adored, delivering the morning paper, working the soda fountain at Dawson\u0027s Drugstore. A local banker lent him $300 to go to college to become a doctor, and so he started, got a girl, but then America called just as manhood did, so he went into the army. Within twenty months, he was in a foxhole, ducking, spitting out dirt. \u0022Move out!\u0022 came the command, and he snapped to, got on his feet, waved the platoon obediently out of the trench and forward into the wall of smoke in the middle of nowhere, Italy, in the Apennine mountains. Nazis were pouring artillery rounds from the pillbox bunkers on the hill above, the U.S. bombers blasting that hill to bits, napalm bombs, the mountains soon in flames. Guys tripping into wires, traps, land mines, explosions, then machine-gun fire, guys down everywhere, just lying there dead, everywhere, and then his buddy Sims, his radio guy, bam, Sims was down, Sims! So he crawled in the dirt, having no idea Sims was already dead, slithered in the dirt to Sims and grabbed his shirt and pulled, pulled, and then bam! He felt it in his back, fire in his back, and he lay in the dirt gurgling words, his body seizing up to his eyeballs, only his eyeballs could move, but maybe his mouth, he could feel the dirt in his mouth, yes, his mouth. Another soldier weeping, pissing his pants, a skinny kid shouting, \u0022God help me!\u0022 crawling under the artillery, dragging guys, dead guys, barely alive guys, dragging Lieutenant Dole, who was way too big, way too heavy, so the skinny kid rolled Lieutenant Dole like a sack of sand, over, over, blood pouring out, down into a ravine. In and out of consciousness for six more hours on the bloody battlefield, Bob Dole\u0027s mind went home, to Russell, Kansas, running up Maple Street. I always run. I\u0027m running track in school. Hey, Dad, I think we have a good chance of going to state in football this year. I see Spitzy, our little white dog. Spitzy, what are you doing out in this kind of weather?\u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000A I ask if he ever thought about what the country would have been like if he\u0027d been president.\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027ve thought about it, not a lot, but I thought my relationship with Congress—the Democrats and Republicans—would help me get some things done. Not everything, but at least they\u0027d be willing to try.\u0022\u000A\u000A Bipartisan leadership, he tells me, was not exceedingly complicated. \u0022We\u0027d meet on an issue. If we could work it out, we\u0027d work it out. If it wasn\u0027t possible, we\u0027d have a vote.\u0022\u000A\u000A Done. \u000A\u000A \u0022We had our problems,\u0022 he says. \u0022It wasn\u0027t softball. But it never, I recall, became personal. It never was pointing a finger at somebody and saying something that should have been unsaid. We kept our word.\u000A\u000A \u0022I really thought, with my background growing up, and my service, and all that, I thought it would be enough for the presidency,\u0022 he says. \u0022But... It sure was enough when I ran for Congress.\u0022 He reminisces about those good old campaign days, serving Dole pineapple juice to get his name out there, and a singing quartet. \u0022It wasn\u0027t so much about money then. \u000A\u000A \u0022The president says he\u0027s going to raise a billion dollars. A billion dollars. I assume Romney will spend some of his personal fortune plus corporate donations to his super PAC. I mean, it\u0027s out of control now.\u0022\u000A\u000A I think perhaps we\u0027ll linger here, get worked up about how big money, really big money, has corrupted presidential politics, and perhaps join in a moment of sorrow about how America is going to hell in a handbasket.\u000A\u000A But no. That is not Bob Dole\u0027s bag. \u0022Be a doer, not a stewer,\u0022 that\u0027s his motto. He\u0027s a soda jerk from Russell, Kansas, where you served milkshakes, cheered the people up. \u000A\u000A \u0022Have you been out to the memorial?\u0022 he asks me. \u000A\u000A I tell him yes, I have, and his face opens like a sudden begonia bloom, a movie-star smile, gleaming charm and invitation. \u000A\u000A The World War II Memorial, at the eastern end of the Reflecting Pool on the Mall, was opened a long time after the end of the war. A long darn time, in 2004. Granite pillars, arches, 4,048 gold stars, each representing one hundred American war dead. It was a big deal to Dole, who led the charge to make it happen. \u000A\u000A \u0022Now they bring in guys from all over the country to see it,\u0022 he says. The Honor Flight Network shuttles any vet who wants to visit the memorials for free, about 80,000 so far. Dole likes to greet them. \u000A\u000A \u0022I received a letter from a veteran who said, \u0027You know, I was down—\u0027 let\u0027s see, how did he say it—\u0027I was down and depressed and felt I\u0027d never done anything, and then I came on one of the flights, and it made me feel good, kind of restored my dignity. I did contribute something.\u0027 You don\u0027t have to be shot at to serve your nation. He said his daughters were going to be proud of this new man. Just that one little trip saved this poor soul.\u0022\u000A\u000A I congratulate Bob Dole on the memorial, making the point that it seems hard for people to get anything done in Washington these days.\u000A\u000A He\u0027s leaning off to his right, sagging in the direction of his missing shoulder. He used to wear a shoulder pad. I don\u0027t think he has it on. Senator Elizabeth Dole, his wife, told me he used hidden Velcro under the flap of his already-buttoned shirts so that he could easily slip it on each morning. Isn\u0027t that clever? It speeds things up. She said it takes him hours to get dressed each morning. Hours. Help? He would never accept help. Oh my, never. \u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000A Bob Dole is not a bitter man. That part is jarring. His life was hard. His life was all heavy lifting and dropping, lifting and dropping. The regret hadn\u0027t jelled into anger. \u000A\u000A There\u0027s a plaque on the windowsill. YOU\u0027LL NEVER WALK ALONE, it says, and I ask him about it.\u000A\u000A He doesn\u0027t point, doesn\u0027t even crane his neck; all his motions are in his eyes. \u0022It\u0027s a song,\u0022 he says. \u0022I played it I don\u0027t know how many, a hundred times. Drove my mother crazy. It fits. If you listen to the words, it fits.\u0022\u000A\u000A Bob Dole is not a romantic, at least not an immediate one. Bob Dole is not one to waste a lot of time on metaphor. When he heard Sinatra croon, You\u0027ll never walk alone, he heard, well, walk. Alone. He was a 22-year-old mangled soldier, sitting in a wheelchair that his arms could not even push, and he would listen to that song, think, and concentrate.  \u000A\u000A If I kept struggling to make my legs move, he would write, later, to put one foot in front of the other... All of heaven would help me; my upbringing would help, my grandparents, schoolteachers, athletic team coaches, university professors, my boot camp sergeants... \u000A\u000A Dole spent three years in hospitals before emerging with a body that basically worked, minus a kidney, minus a shoulder, minus a functioning right arm. His left arm worked, but just two fingers on that hand worked, and thus empowered, unable to so much as write lecture notes, he trained his brain to memorize, and in time he earned a B.A. and a law degree, both magna cum laude. Don\u0027t complain. Push forward. Don\u0027t dwell on it. \u0022Be a doer, not a stewer!\u0022 Years and years later, when he ran for the Republican nomination for president against George H. W. Bush in 1988, it bothered him to see those photos of Bush tromping all athletically through New Hampshire, shoveling snow, pushing stranded cars to show himself a man of honest sweat and brawn. That part did bother him. And again in 1996 when he got the nomination, ran in the general, Clinton golfing, Clinton at the C&amp;O Canal clearing deadwood, heave-ho\u0027ing big logs. Bob Dole couldn\u0027t do any of that. Hell, he did not have the dexterity to pick up a Big Mac. He would never publicly appear...manly. He would never publicly expose his shrunken biceps. He would never himself look at his missing shoulder in the mirror, draping a towel over it when naked. \u000A\u000A \u0022Have you been out to Walter Reed?\u0022 he asks.\u000A\u000A He keeps steering our conversation here. To vets. Young vets, old vets, this war, that war—they mix together, and keeping track stops mattering. He talks about an injured helicopter pilot, a Purple Heart, a matchmaking scheme to set up that fine man with a pretty therapist at Walter Reed. He talks about programs, programs for vets. When I met with Elizabeth Dole, she made sure I knew about his programs, programs for vets. She had programs, too. Between the two of them, it is programs, programs, programs. I imagine them sharing a lifetime of meals together, brainstorming programs. Commitment to a life of service—does anyone in this age of cynicism and billion-dollar campaigns really mean it? \u000A\u000A I thank Bob Dole for his time. He\u0027s sagging like noodles now, drooping so far over that I want to reach over and give him a helpful shove. Then again, I feel I should stand and salute. \u000A\u000A NEVER NEVER NEVER GIVE UP reads a plaque behind Dole. \u000A\u000A I ask Bob Dole if he has a message for America. \u000A\u000A \u0022Message for America,\u0022 he says. He makes his lips tight, rubs them together, and his thick eyes wander around for some time. \u000A\u000A \u0022Things are going to get better,\u0022 he says. \u0022Be optimistic.\u0022\u000A\u000A Jeanne Marie Laskas is a GQ correspondent.",

It&apos;s either Newt&apos;s way or the highway. He&apos;s got a lot of ideas. Some of them are good; not many. So it looked to me like it would be either Romney or Newt for the nomination, but just on its own, I thought he&#x2014;well, I&apos;ll say this: Romney&#xA0;<em>looks</em> like a president.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.b"> It&apos;s always discomfiting to listen to people try to conjure&#xA0;any serious oomph when&#xA0;taking about Romney, and this moment is no exception. I make the point that Mitt Romney&apos;s&#xA0;background is different from Bob Dole&apos;s. &quot;You&apos;re self-made,&quot; I say. &quot;You embody the American Dream.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.c"> &quot;I&apos;ve never known a lot of rich people,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s not my bag.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.d"> His bag, even at 88, is to dress in a suit each day and show up at the law firm on F&#xA0;Street in Washington, D.C., grand and formal where dressy people are busy and hushed. He seems propped behind his big walnut desk, his soft body slumped like an infant&apos;s in a high chair, his chin lowered over the knot of his polka-dot tie, trousers hiked high. He&apos;s wearing a crisp white shirt, and his thin hair is combed into obedient stripes. A fresh cotton ball taped over paper-thin skin on the back of his hand suggests hospital matters not quite resolved.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.e"> I ask him how he sizes up President Obama.</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.f"> &quot;He&apos;s a nice person. I have a good relationship with the White House, I just think he&apos;s totally out of step. We&apos;re moving farther to the left, and it may not be as bad as some people say, but we&apos;ve got to cut spending. One of these days, we&apos;ll probably have to raise tas. I just think his philosophy is too far to the left.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.g"> He blinks softly, not moving much else at all. His mind is clear. Sharp. But his body. It&apos;s as if his big blocky head were not attached to the dwindling rest of him. I ask about some of the central concerns of the campaign&#x2014;income inequality, negative ads, health care, gay marriage&#x2014;and while he appears engaged by the questions, he lacks the zeal to offer more than the &quot;one man, one woman,&quot; &quot;reduce spending&quot; party lines. His fuller thoughts lie elsewhere. He is an old man with old-man stuff going on in his head: back-in-the-day, and good golly, all those great guys and gals stomping through his time here on earth, so many more to hurry up and meet.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.h"> &quot;Bill Clinton called me one day recently,&quot; he offers. &quot;I said, &apos;What do you want?&apos; He said, &apos;I want to see how you&apos;re doing. How&apos;s your health?&apos; He&apos;s done that a couple times. If I did anything, I made a&#xA0;lot of friends. And they were&#xA0;Republicans, of course, and Democrats.&quot; Clinton would help Dole deal with Gingrich. &quot;I&apos;m&#xA0;not going to talk to him,&#xA0;<em>you</em> talk to him,&quot; Dole, as Senate majority leader, would say to Clinton. &quot;No,&#xA0;<em>you</em> talk to him.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.i"> &quot;President Obama came to visit me in the hospital. He said, &apos;I wish you were still in the Senate; I need your help.&apos; I&apos;m not certain I can help on everything. Maybe some things.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.j"> Bob Dole doesn&apos;t kid himself. He knows what he&apos;s good at (getting laughs, getting things done). He championed causes today&apos;s conservatives run full campaigns against&#x2014;civil rights, food stamps, benefits for the disabled. And Bob Dole knows what he&apos;s bad at (winning really big elections). He lost the vice presidency to Mondale in 1976 and then the presidency to Clinton in 1996. He even wears failure with a candor that seems lacking in Washington these days.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.k"> &quot;I don&apos;t know how many people run for vice president and president and lose both,&quot; Bob Dole says, turning to his aides. &quot;I think there&apos;s one other?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.l"> &quot;You&apos;re testing my history on that one, sir.

Bob Dole thinks Bob Dole should.&quot; Said a fake&#xA0;snoozing Bob Dole in a short&#xA0;red tie on&#xA0;<em>Family Guy:</em> &quot;Bob&#xA0;Dole is a friend of the tobacco&#xA0;industry.

Bob Dole.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.t"> You can&apos;t think &quot;Dole&quot; without thinking &quot;Bob Dole,&quot; and cartoons and third-person good times. He was one of&#xA0;<em>those </em>politicians, the kind you jabbed but were happy enough to have around. His politics were plenty conservative&#x2014;and yet by today&apos;s standards seem almost quaint. Bob Dole. He&apos;s like the neighbors&apos; Labrador retriever your dad used to curse for all that barking, all that darn digging in your mom&apos;s tulip bed, and now look, you live next door to a godforsaken pack of teeth-baring rabid Pomeranians, and, good golly, Bob Dole!</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.u"> When we met, he had his signature blue Flair pen in his right hand and an extra one anchored in his shirt pocket. He has always had the pen there, to keep his fingers from curling into a fist; as a side benefit, it reminds people not to reach out to shake his right hand, because he can&apos;t.</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.v"> &quot;Always have time for the daughter of a World War II serviceman,&quot; he said to me when we first met. It wasn&apos;t how I&apos;d ever thought of defining myself, and I didn&apos;t remember mentioning any of that stuff to his people, so it caught me off guard.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.w"> &quot;Oh, the war,&quot; I said, awkwardly. &quot;Oh, my dad sure was proud of that...war.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.x"> &quot;Navy?&quot; Bob Dole said, and I nodded. &quot;And he&apos;s still...?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.y"> &quot;He died last year.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.z"> &quot;I see.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.10"> It was a lot to cover in the first fourteen seconds of meeting anyone; Bob Dole goes right for the patriotism jugular. His service in World War II is almost certainly how he defines himself, even though he spent much of his public life hiding the wounds: right shoulder, arm, hand. He was never one to use the story to further his image, hardly even talked about the whole mess until&#xA0;recently in a memoir.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.11"> He was an athlete. He was a poor kid from rural Kansas&#x2014;Depression, Dust Bowl, his parents moving the family to the basement to rent out the upstairs for money. He was a good kid, honors, played football, a basketball hero, gorgeous young man the girls adored, delivering the morning paper, working the soda fountain at Dawson&apos;s Drugstore. A local banker lent him $300 to go to college to become a doctor, and so he started, got a girl, but then America called just as manhood did, so he went into the army. Within twenty months, he was in a foxhole, ducking, spitting out dirt. &quot;Move out!&quot; came the command, and he snapped to, got on his feet, waved the platoon obediently out of the trench and forward into the wall of smoke in the middle of nowhere, Italy, in the Apennine mountains. Nazis were pouring artillery rounds from the pillbox bunkers on the hill above, the U.S. bombers blasting that hill to bits, napalm bombs, the mountains soon in flames. Guys tripping into wires, traps, land mines, explosions, then machine-gun fire, guys down everywhere, just lying there dead, everywhere, and then his buddy Sims, his radio guy, bam, Sims was down,&#xA0;<em>Sims! </em>So he crawled in the dirt, having no idea Sims was already dead, slithered in the dirt to Sims and grabbed his shirt and pulled, pulled, and then&#xA0;<em>bam!</em> He felt it in his back, fire in his back, and he lay in the dirt gurgling words, his body seizing up to his eyeballs, only his eyeballs could move, but maybe his mouth, he could feel the dirt in his mouth, yes, his mouth. Another soldier weeping, pissing his pants, a skinny kid shouting, &quot;God help me!&quot; crawling under the artillery, dragging guys, dead guys, barely alive guys, dragging Lieutenant Dole, who was way too big, way too heavy, so the skinny kid rolled Lieutenant Dole like a sack of sand, over, over, blood pouring out, down into a ravine. In and out of consciousness for six more hours on the bloody battlefield, Bob Dole&apos;s mind went home, to Russell, Kansas, running up Maple Street.&#xA0;<em>I always run. I&apos;m running track in school. Hey, Dad, I think we have a good chance of going to state in football this year. I see Spitzy, our little white dog. Spitzy, what are you doing out in this kind of weather?</em></p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.12"> &#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.13"> I ask if&#xA0;he ever thought about what the country would have been like if he&apos;d been president.</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.14"> &quot;I&apos;ve thought about it, not a lot, but I thought my relationship with Congress&#x2014;the Democrats and Republicans&#x2014;would help me get some things done. Not everything, but at least they&apos;d be willing to try.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.15"> Bipartisan leadership, he tells me, was not exceedingly complicated. &quot;We&apos;d meet on an issue. If we could work it out, we&apos;d work it out. If it wasn&apos;t possible, we&apos;d have a vote.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.16"> Done.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.17"> &quot;We had our problems,&quot; he says. &quot;It wasn&apos;t softball. But it never, I recall, became personal. It never was pointing a finger at somebody and saying something that should have been unsaid. We kept our word.</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.18"> &quot;I really thought, with my background growing up, and my service, and all that, I thought it would be enough for the presidency,&quot; he says. &quot;But... It sure was enough when I ran for Congress.&quot; He reminisces about those good old campaign days, serving Dole pineapple juice to get his name out there, and a singing quartet. &quot;It wasn&apos;t so much about money then.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.19"> &quot;The president says he&apos;s going to raise a billion dollars. A&#xA0;<em>billion</em> dollars. I assume Romney will spend some of his personal fortune plus corporate donations to his super PAC. I mean, it&apos;s out of control now.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> I think perhaps we&apos;ll linger here, get worked up about how big money, really big money, has corrupted presidential politics, and perhaps join in a moment of sorrow about how America is going to hell in a handbasket.</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> But no. That is not Bob Dole&apos;s bag. &quot;Be a doer, not a stewer,&quot; that&apos;s his motto. He&apos;s a soda jerk from Russell, Kansas, where you served milkshakes, cheered the people up.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> &quot;Have you been out to the memorial?&quot; he asks me.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> I tell him yes, I have, and his face opens like a sudden begonia bloom, a movie-star smile, gleaming charm and invitation.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> The World War II Memorial, at the eastern end of the Reflecting Pool on the Mall, was opened a long time after the end of the war. A long darn time, in 2004. Granite pillars, arches, 4,048 gold stars, each representing one hundred American war dead. It was a big deal to Dole, who led the charge to make it happen.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> &quot;Now they bring in guys from all over the country to see it,&quot; he says. The Honor Flight Network shuttles any vet who wants to visit the memorials for free, about 80,000 so far. Dole likes to greet them.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> &quot;I received a letter from a veteran who said, &apos;You know, I was down&#x2014;&apos; let&apos;s see, how did he say it&#x2014;&apos;I was down and depressed and felt I&apos;d never done anything, and then I came on one of the flights, and it made me feel good, kind of restored my dignity. I did contribute something.&apos; You don&apos;t have to be shot at to serve your nation. He said his daughters were going to be proud of this new man. Just that one little trip saved this poor soul.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1h"> I congratulate Bob Dole on the memorial, making the point that it seems hard for people to get anything done in Washington these days.</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1i"> He&apos;s leaning off to his right, sagging in the direction of his missing shoulder. He used to wear a shoulder pad. I don&apos;t think he has it on. Senator Elizabeth Dole, his wife, told me he used hidden Velcro under the flap of his already-buttoned shirts so that he could easily slip it on each morning.&#xA0;<em>Isn&apos;t that clever?&#xA0;</em>It speeds things up. She said it takes him hours to get dressed each morning. Hours.&#xA0;<em>Help? He would never accept help. Oh my, never.&#xA0;</em></p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1j"> &#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1k"> Bob Dole&#xA0;is not a bitter man. That part is jarring. His life was hard. His life was all heavy lifting and dropping, lifting and dropping. The regret hadn&apos;t jelled into anger.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1l"> There&apos;s a plaque on the windowsill.&#xA0;YOU&apos;LL NEVER WALK ALONE, it says, and I ask him about it.</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1m"> He doesn&apos;t point, doesn&apos;t even crane his neck; all his motions are in his eyes. &quot;It&apos;s a song,&quot; he says. &quot;I played it I don&apos;t know how many, a hundred times. Drove my mother crazy. It fits. If you listen to the words, it fits.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1n"> Bob Dole is not a romantic, at least not an immediate one. Bob Dole is not one to waste a lot of time on metaphor. When he heard Sinatra croon,&#xA0;<em>You&apos;ll never walk alone,</em> he heard, well,&#xA0;<em>walk.</em> Alone. He was a 22-year-old mangled soldier, sitting in a wheelchair that his arms could not even push, and he would listen to that song, think, and concentrate. &#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1o"> <em>If I kept struggling to make my legs move,</em> he would write, later,&#xA0;<em>to put one foot in front of the other... All of heaven would help me; my upbringing would help, my grandparents, schoolteachers, athletic team coaches, university professors, my boot camp sergeants...&#xA0;</em></p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1p"> Dole spent three years in hospitals before emerging with a body that basically worked, minus a kidney, minus a shoulder, minus a functioning right arm. His left arm worked, but just two fingers on that hand worked, and thus empowered, unable to so much as write lecture notes, he trained his brain to memorize, and in time he earned a B.A. and a law degree, both magna cum laude.&#xA0;<em>Don&apos;t complain. Push forward. Don&apos;t dwell on it.&#xA0;</em>&quot;Be a doer, not a stewer!&quot; Years and years later, when he ran for the Republican nomination for president against George H. W. Bush in 1988, it bothered him to see those photos of Bush tromping all athletically through New Hampshire, shoveling snow, pushing stranded cars to show himself a man of honest sweat and brawn. That part did bother him. And again in 1996 when he got the nomination, ran in the general, Clinton golfing, Clinton at the C&amp;O Canal clearing deadwood, heave-ho&apos;ing big logs. Bob Dole couldn&apos;t do any of that. Hell, he did not have the dexterity to pick up a Big Mac. He would never publicly appear...manly. He would never publicly expose his shrunken biceps. He would never himself look at his missing shoulder in the mirror, draping a towel over it when naked.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1q"> &quot;Have you been out to Walter Reed?&quot; he asks.</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1r"> He keeps steering our conversation here. To vets. Young vets, old vets, this war, that war&#x2014;they mix together, and keeping track stops mattering. He talks about an injured helicopter pilot, a Purple Heart, a matchmaking scheme to set up that fine man with a pretty therapist at Walter Reed. He talks about programs, programs for vets. When I met with Elizabeth Dole, she made sure I knew about his programs, programs for vets. She had programs, too. Between the two of them, it is programs, programs, programs. I imagine them sharing a lifetime of meals together, brainstorming programs. Commitment to a life of service&#x2014;does anyone in this age of cynicism and billion-dollar campaigns really mean it?&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1s"> I thank Bob Dole for his time. He&apos;s sagging like noodles now, drooping so far over that I want to reach over and give him a helpful shove. Then again, I feel I should stand and salute.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1t"> NEVER NEVER NEVER GIVE UP&#xA0;reads a plaque behind Dole.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1u"> I ask Bob Dole if he has a message for America.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1v"> &quot;Message for America,&quot; he says. He makes his lips tight, rubs them together, and his thick eyes wander around for some time.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1w"> &quot;Things are going to get better,&quot; he says. &quot;Be optimistic.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19dmjg49728.1.1.0.0.4.1x"> <em>Jeanne Marie Laskas&#xA0;is a&#xA0;GQ&#xA0;correspondent.</em></p></div><div class="grid"
