  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AIt was mesmerizing; it was scary; it was unfathomable. NASA was going to land Curiosity, a one-ton rover, on Mars. The whole world would watch them try. But first, the Entry, Descent and Landing team (EDL) had to ferry the $2.5 billion spacecraft through the perilous Martian atmosphere, a gauntlet that had wrecked previous missions. The landing sequence itself included elements never before attempted or even practiced (you can\u0027t rehearse a Mars landing), such as \u0022the sky crane,\u0022 a contraption designed to hover close to the surface and lower Curiosity onto the ground with a tether. It was just a small part of an operation dubbed \u0022Seven Minutes of Terror.\u0022\u000A\u000AAdam Steltzner (phase lead): It was so audacious, right? If we made a smoking hole on the surface of Mars, there wouldn\u0027t be much sympathy. It wouldn\u0027t be \u0022Ooooh, you poor thing.\u0022 It would be \u0022You fucking idiot! Of course it failed! It looked fucking ridiculous!\u0022 Every bumpkin in the world would tell me it was patently obvious it would never work.\u000A\u000AAnn Devereaux (flight-system lead): Adam is a force of nature.\u000A\u000AAnita Sengupta (parachute-systems engineer): EDL attracts strong personalities.\u000A\u000ARaymond Baker (Mars-lander-engines lead): Have you seen his hair?\u000A\u000A[Steltzner has a soaring pompadour.]\u000A\u000ASteltzner: I\u0027m going for not so much a rockabilly thing as a jet-age, Mad Men-y kind of thing.\u000A\u000ADevereaux: To the delight of the team, Bobak\u0027s Mohawk [that of systems engineer Bobak Ferdowsi] grabbed all the media attention  that night.\u000A\u000ASteltzner: I would be dishonest if I said that didn\u0027t sting a little.\u000A\u000ADevereaux: It was like Alien vs. Predator, those two hairstyles.\u000A\u000AJody Davis (trajectory analyst): It was awfully quiet on EDL day. Usually I would have seventy e-mails, but not much was going on.\u000A\u000ADevereaux: Really, we had finished all of our work a week before. We\u0027d sent the spacecraft the command to land herself. She was on her own. One night that last week, I got really weepy. I thought, \u0022She\u0027s out there all alone! How can we help her?\u0022 It was a hit to my ego. It\u0027s like being a parent. Curiosity needed us for so long. Now she didn\u0027t. She could land on her own.\u000A\u000AAllen Chen (operations lead, play-by-play announcer): The day of EDL, we had a team lunch at Burger Continental.\u000A\u000ASteltzner: I had established that tradition on MERs [Mars Exploration Rovers], having breakfast there both of those mornings, because Spirit and Opportunity had been successful. I wasn\u0027t in the mood for Burger Continental, but we had to go   to Burger Continental. We had   no choice.\u000A\u000AChen: Have you heard about the peanut tradition? It goes back to landing on the moon. There had been lots of failures. Then, one day, someone brought peanuts into mission control. The mission was a success. Ever since then, we eat peanuts during EDL.\u000A\u000ABaker: Engineers don\u0027t believe in superstition. We believe in the laws of physics. But when it comes to things like this, you have a sense you\u0027d better do what you\u0027ve always done before.\u000A\u000AChen: You know the saying—\u0022There are no atheists in a foxhole.\u0022\u000A\u000ABaker: Late afternoon, things started happening. My Twitter feed started buzzing like mad. Then this radio show in Australia wants to interview me. That\u0027s when I realize the whole world is watching.\u000A\u000AChen: My job is to explain to the world what\u0027s going on. That was the first time anyone had ever put makeup on me. Not many people get to have their life\u0027s work play out before the whole world and also do the play-by-play of it. It was nerve-racking.\u000A\u000ADevereaux: We see that people are watching in Times Square. There\u0027s a landing party at a bar in Seattle.\u000A\u000AChen: TV goes live with programming at eight thirty. The girl who named Curiosity is outside getting interviewed. There are sound checks. It\u0027s surreal.\u000A\u000ADevereaux: My job was to be the fire extinguisher behind the glass. Hypothetically, something goes wrong, I\u0027m expected to break the glass and leap into action. But really there was nothing I could do. There was nothing anyone in that room could do.\u000A\u000ASteve Sell (war-room chief): We\u0027re just monitoring the data as it comes in. We\u0027ve got engineers monitoring specific events, giving a thumbs-up if we\u0027re nominal. We make that call on the network and let Allen know.\u000A\u000ABaker: A big milestone is forty minutes before atmosphere, a signal called EDL main. It\u0027s basically \u0022Okay, no kidding, we\u0027re doing EDL now.\u0022 I\u0027m a snowboarder, so it\u0027s like you\u0027ve gotten off the ski lift, you\u0027ve edged over, and you\u0027re looking down that double black diamond.\u000A\u000AChen: Ten minutes before cruise-stage separation, Adam selects \u0022All or Nothing at All\u0022 by Sinatra, plays it over the network.\u000A\u000ASell: There\u0027s a fourteen-minute speed-of-light delay. When we learn we\u0027re hitting the top of the atmosphere, in reality Curiosity has been sitting on the surface for seven minutes. Or she\u0027s dead. Either way, it was all over seven minutes ago.\u000A\u000ASteltzner: But you don\u0027t live it that way. You\u0027re in the moment.\u000A\u000AChen: We separate from cruise and switch to an omnidirectional antenna. Our data stream slows significantly. We\u0027ve suddenly got the speed of a dial-up modem, a blip of data every ten seconds.\u000A\u000ABaker: If you want to make an engineer nervous, take away his data.\u000A\u000AChen: We watch the spacecraft turn off the fault-protection software. That keeps it from doing anything dangerous during cruise. It\u0027s about to start doing lots of dangerous things.\u000A\u000ASell: You can feel the anxiety level starting to rise.\u000A\u000ASteltzner: I\u0027m not sitting. I can\u0027t sit.\u000A\u000ADevereaux: I\u0027m seated next to the chief engineer, Rob Manning. He and Adam are pacers. The two of them are doing cycles around the room. They\u0027ve got their own little orbits.\u000A\u000ADavis: We had run millions of simulations. Now we had one chance to get it right.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFrom left: Miguel San Martin, Richard Cook, Adam Steltzner, Erisa Hines from the Entry, Descent and Landing team \u000A\u000ASteltzner: When you get close to Mars, Mars starts sucking you in.\u000A\u000ABaker: We hit the atmosphere doing 13,000 mph.\u000A\u000AChen: We pressurize the engines, start flying towards the target.\u000A\u000ABaker: We\u0027ve got eight rockets producing sixty pounds of thrust.\u000A\u000AChen: We\u0027re doing bank reversals, steering from left to right.\u000A\u000ABaker: We\u0027re carving S\u0027s in the upper atmosphere.\u000A\u000AChen: In seventy seconds we hit our peak temperature, 1,300 degrees Celsius [2,372 Fahrenheit], and peak deceleration. The spacecraft is pulling twelve Earth g\u0027s.\u000A\u000ABaker: For thirteen minutes we\u0027re getting this really low data rate, which means we\u0027re doing some critical things in the dark—cruise separation, de-spinning, pressurizing. Then boom! All our screens light up. We\u0027ve got our data back. The Mars Odyssey satellite is now close enough to the spacecraft to give us a faster rate.\u000A\u000ABaker: We do a maneuver called \u0022straighten up and fly right\u0022 just before the parachute deploys. The parachute is going to yank us with 60,000 pounds of force.\u000A\u000ASengupta: Parachute deployment is particularly violent and chaotic.\u000A\u000AChen: We lose communication briefly when violent things happen to the spacecraft. Things are tense.\u000A\u000ASengupta: It\u0027s the largest parachute ever used on Mars, and it\u0027s deployed at the largest Mach number a parachute has ever been deployed, 950 mph, two times the speed of sound on Mars. It\u0027s unpredictable. It acts like a big jellyfish, collapsing and reinflating. It\u0027s just spewing everywhere.\u000A\u000ABaker: We slow dramatically with the parachute.\u000A\u000AChen: The parachute deploys; the heat shield drops; our radar picks up the ground. We\u0027re nine kilometers up. You can hear some excitement in people\u0027s voices. But this is a place that has killed us in tests.\u000A\u000ABaker: At back-shell separation, we sever the parachute, and the descent stage and rover fall out and free-fall for one second.\u000A\u000AChen: We activate the descent-stage thrusters. We do some pretty gnarly maneuvers to fly away from the back shell and parachute.\u000A\u000ABaker: We\u0027re falling at 200 mph one minute before impact. The engines throttle up to slow us to 64 mph. I\u0027ve never been more stressed-out.\u000A\u000AChen: Now we\u0027re hovering twenty meters above the surface, moving less than 2 mph.\u000A\u000ASteltzner: I hear Al say, \u0022Sky crane start.\u0022 That was the part I was frankly most nervous about.\u000A\u000ADavis: I\u0027m the one who has to tell everyone that we\u0027ve touched down, but you can\u0027t say, \u0022Touchdown.\u0022 There are two more confirmation steps after that.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFrom left: Steve Sell, Bobak Ferdowsi, and Allen Chen from the Entry, Descent and Landing team \u000A\u000ASell: You don\u0027t want Allen telling the world we\u0027ve touched down when it\u0027s not confirmed. You don\u0027t want to fumble on the one-yard line.\u000A\u000ADavis: So we came up with \u0022Tango delta nominal.\u0022 Only the core people knew what that meant.\u000A\u000ASteltzner: I hear Jody say, \u0022Tango delta nominal.\u0022\u000A\u000ADavis: I want to scream it, but you have to remain cool and collected.\u000A\u000ASteltzner: I\u0027m like, \u0022This could be pretty cool,\u0022 but I\u0027m still listening, listening...\u000A\u000ASell: There\u0027s an inertial sensor in Curiosity. When we learn that the rover is no longer moving, someone will say, \u0022RIMU stable.\u0022\u000A\u000ASteltzner: I hear, \u0022RIMU stable...\u0022\u000A\u000ASengupta: You\u0027ve still got those high-velocity supersonic jets hovering twenty feet over the rover. You don\u0027t want that.\u000A\u000ABaker: Curiosity tells the descent stage to fly away. Then it\u0027s got   .7 seconds to fire pyrotechnic devices that cut the cables or it\u0027s going for  a ride.\u000A\u000ADavis: Everyone\u0027s bubbling with anticipation. I start this clock in the back of my head. We have to wait ten seconds after \u0022RIMU stable\u0022 to make sure the fly-away has happened.\u000A\u000ABaker: The descent stage flies 625 meters away and crashes into the surface going 100 mph.\u000A\u000AChen: Adam pokes me in the shoulder. I say, \u0022Touchdown confirmed. We are safe on Mars.\u0022\u000A\u000ASell: The room erupts.\u000A\u000ASteltzner: Almost immediately we get the thumbnail images. For me, that was it. That was the human existential proof that we did it.\u000A\u000ABaker: [In the satellite photos] you could see this little plume. That was all my hardware and engines going up in a cloud of debris and vapor. Sometimes I think of someone finding that stuff one day, the stuff some nameless engineer spent eleven years of his life on. It would be like finding one of Columbus\u0027s ships.\u000A\u000ADevereaux: The data is great, but you see pictures and you think, That is fucking Mars!\u000A\u000ADavis: \u0022Tango delta nominal\u0022 has become its own thing. I get tweets from people taking trips, and when their plane lands, they\u0027ll say, \u0022Tango delta nominal Paris\u0022 or \u0022Tango delta nominal L.A.\u0022\u000A\u000ADevereaux: I walked around in a trance for a week.\u000A\u000ASteltzner: So, um, it was a great night. Inspirational.\u000A\u000AMen\u0027s shirts by Brooks Brothers. Ties by The Tie Bar",

it was scary; it was unfathomable. NASA was going to land <em>Curiosity,</em> a one-ton rover, on Mars. The whole world would watch them try. But first, the Entry, Descent and Landing team (EDL) had to ferry the $2.5 billion spacecraft through the perilous Martian atmosphere, a gauntlet that had wrecked previous missions. The landing sequence itself included elements never before attempted or even practiced (you can&apos;t rehearse a Mars landing), such as &quot;the sky crane,&quot; a contraption designed to hover close to the surface and lower<em> Curiosity </em>onto the ground with a tether. It was just a small part of an operation dubbed &quot;Seven Minutes of Terror.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>Adam Steltzner</strong> <em>(phase lead):</em> It was so audacious, right? If we made a smoking hole on the surface of Mars, there wouldn&apos;t be much sympathy. It wouldn&apos;t be &quot;Ooooh, you poor thing.&quot; It would be &quot;You fucking idiot! Of course it failed! It looked fucking ridiculous!&quot; Every bumpkin in the world would tell me it was patently obvious it would never work.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>Ann Devereaux</strong> <em>(flight-system lead):</em> Adam is a force of nature.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Anita Sengupta </strong><em>(parachute-systems engineer):</em> EDL attracts strong personalities.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Raymond Baker </strong><em>(Mars-lander-engines lead):</em> Have you seen his hair?</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.7"><em>[Steltzner has a soaring pompadour.]</em></p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Steltzner: </strong>I&apos;m going for not so much a rockabilly thing as a jet-age, <em>Mad Men</em>-y kind of thing.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>Devereaux: </strong>To the delight of the team, Bobak&apos;s Mohawk [that of systems engineer Bobak Ferdowsi] grabbed all the media attention  that night.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Steltzner: </strong>I would be dishonest if I said that didn&apos;t sting a little.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Devereaux: </strong>It was like Alien vs. Predator, those two hairstyles.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Jody Davis</strong> <em>(trajectory analyst):</em> It was awfully quiet on EDL day. Usually I would have seventy e-mails, but not much was going on.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Devereaux: </strong>Really, we had finished all of our work a week before. We&apos;d sent the spacecraft the command to land herself. She was on her own. One night that last week, I got really weepy. I thought, &quot;She&apos;s out there all alone! How can we help her?&quot; It was a hit to my ego. It&apos;s like being a parent. <em>Curiosity</em> needed us for so long. Now she didn&apos;t. She could land on her own.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Allen Chen </strong><em>(operations lead, play-by-play announcer): </em>The day of EDL, we had a team lunch at Burger Continental.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Steltzner:</strong> I had established that tradition on MERs [Mars Exploration Rovers], having breakfast there both of those mornings, because <em>Spirit</em> and <em>Opportunity</em> had been successful. I wasn&apos;t in the mood for Burger Continental, but we had to go   to Burger Continental. We had   no choice.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Chen: </strong>Have you heard about the peanut tradition? It goes back to landing on the moon. There had been lots of failures. Then, one day, someone brought peanuts into mission control. The mission was a success. Ever since then, we eat peanuts during EDL.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>Baker:</strong> Engineers don&apos;t believe in superstition. We believe in the laws of physics. But when it comes to things like this, you have a sense you&apos;d better do what you&apos;ve always done before.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Chen:</strong> You know the saying&#x2014;&quot;There are no atheists in a foxhole.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>Baker:</strong> Late afternoon, things started happening. My Twitter feed started buzzing like mad. Then this radio show in Australia wants to interview me. That&apos;s when I realize the whole world is watching.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Chen: </strong>My job is to explain to the world what&apos;s going on. That was the first time anyone had ever put makeup on me. Not many people get to have their life&apos;s work play out before the whole world and also do the play-by-play of it. It was nerve-racking.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>Devereaux: </strong>We see that people are watching in Times Square. There&apos;s a landing party at a bar in Seattle.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Chen: </strong>TV goes live with programming at eight thirty. The girl who named <em>Curiosity</em> is outside getting interviewed. There are sound checks. It&apos;s surreal.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>Devereaux: </strong>My job was to be the fire extinguisher behind the glass. Hypothetically, something goes wrong, I&apos;m expected to break the glass and leap into action. But really there was nothing I could do. There was nothing anyone in that room could do.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>Steve Sell</strong> <em>(war-room chief): </em>We&apos;re just monitoring the data as it comes in. We&apos;ve got engineers monitoring specific events, giving a thumbs-up if we&apos;re nominal. We make that call on the network and let Allen know.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>Baker:</strong> A big milestone is forty minutes before atmosphere, a signal called EDL main. It&apos;s basically &quot;Okay, no kidding, we&apos;re doing EDL now.&quot; I&apos;m a snowboarder, so it&apos;s like you&apos;ve gotten off the ski lift, you&apos;ve edged over, and you&apos;re looking down that double black diamond.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>Chen: </strong>Ten minutes before cruise-stage separation, Adam selects &quot;All or Nothing at All&quot; by Sinatra, plays it over the network.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>Sell:</strong> There&apos;s a fourteen-minute speed-of-light delay. When we learn we&apos;re hitting the top of the atmosphere, in reality <em>Curiosity</em> has been sitting on the surface for seven minutes. Or she&apos;s dead. Either way, it was all over seven minutes ago.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>Steltzner:</strong> But you don&apos;t live it that way. You&apos;re in the moment.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>Chen: </strong>We separate from cruise and switch to an omnidirectional antenna. Our data stream slows significantly. We&apos;ve suddenly got the speed of a dial-up modem, a blip of data every ten seconds.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong>Baker:</strong> If you want to make an engineer nervous, take away his data.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>Chen:</strong> We watch the spacecraft turn off the fault-protection software. That keeps it from doing anything dangerous during cruise. It&apos;s about to start doing lots of dangerous things.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong>Sell:</strong> You can feel the anxiety level starting to rise.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>Steltzner: </strong>I&apos;m not sitting. I can&apos;t sit.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.y"><strong>Devereaux:</strong> I&apos;m seated next to the chief engineer, Rob Manning. He and Adam are pacers. The two of them are doing cycles around the room. They&apos;ve got their own little orbits.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>Davis:</strong> We had run millions of simulations.

Then boom! All our screens light up. We&apos;ve got our data back. The Mars Odyssey satellite is now close enough to the spacecraft to give us a faster rate.</p><p data-reactid=".2f4kotejtvk.1.1.0.0.4.1a"><strong>Baker: </strong>We do a maneuver called &quot;straighten up and fly right&quot; just before the parachute deploys.
