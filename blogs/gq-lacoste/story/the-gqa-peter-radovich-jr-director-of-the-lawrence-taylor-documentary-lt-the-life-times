  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe opening scene of LT: The Life and Times, an unapologetic and often brutally honest documentary about the life of troubled former New York Giants superstar Lawrence Taylor, takes place at the recent wedding of Taylor\u0027s daughter. What unfolds is almost unbearable—and unforgettable—to watch. The NFL Hall-of-Famer arrives expecting to walk his daughter down the aisle, but instead she informs him that it\u0027ll be Taylor and her stepfather sharing the honors. While Taylor angrily vents—\u0022I don\u0027t know why I even bothered coming\u0022—his daughter tells the camera that LT has always been an absentee father and has never even met her future husband. The sequence sets the stage for everything that follows: a rollercoaster of on-the-field highs and off-the-field lows unparalleled in NFL history. LT: The Life and Times, directed by 27-time Sports Emmy winner Peter Radovich, Jr.,premiers on Showtime at 8pm tonight. GQ spoke with Radovich earlier this week, just after the film\u0027s New York City premier.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AAfter doing \u0022A Game of Honor\u0022, your 2011 documentary about the Army-Navy football rivalry, you chose Lawrence Taylor as your next subject. Fairly different material. Why L.T.?\u000A\u000AIn the last fifty years in New York City, you\u0027d be hard-pressed finding a bigger personality in sports. Growing up in Queens, in the heyday of the Lawrence Taylor, he became my favorite player and I\u0027ve always been fascinated by him. I just assumed that a documentary on Lawrence Taylor had been already been done. When I did the research, though, I discovered that it hadn\u0027t. I reached out to his agent, and after L.T. said no to us three times, he finally gave us thegreen light.\u000A\u000AHow\u0027d you go about convincing L.T. to let you document his life in such a raw and honest way?\u000A\u000AMy pitch to him was, \u0022You\u0027re one of the greatestathletes of all-time. It\u0027d be a shame if there wasn\u0027t a movie documenting your life.\u0022 Eventually, after bugging the shit out of him, he saw where I was coming from. But I told him the only way we were doing this was if we covered everything—both the good and the bad. We couldn\u0027t do the football and not get into the other stuff, and we certainly couldn\u0027t do the other stuff and not really get into it. Journalistically, I told him I didn\u0027t feel comfortable with him picking and choosing which topics we covered. I told him you\u0027re either all in or we\u0027re not doing this at all. And to Lawrence\u0027s credit, he agreed to those terms and there was nothing that was off-limits. It\u0027s all in there.\u000A\u000AWhen you\u0027ve got such a beloved athlete—with so many flaws off of the field—how do you balance the professional and personal life in a film?\u000A\u000AThat was by far and away the greatest challenge facing this project. We felt comfortable editorializing things when it came to his football career. We had no qualms calling him one of the greatest players of all-time and glorifying his life on the playing field. But we were very, very careful not to editorialize and not to pass judgment in any way, shape, or form in everything outside of football. We agreed that it wasn\u0027t our place asfilmmakers to glorify or demonize him. We used the interviews we conducted with everyone in his life to take viewers from point A to point B. Going in, we\u0027d heard time and time again that Lawrence Taylor was a bad guy, a bad father, all of that. But the bottom line, in my opinion, is that he did a lot of bad things, yes...but he hurt very specific people when doing them. He didn\u0027t hurt the people watching the games on TV or the fans that cheered for him on Sundays. The only people he hurt were himself, his family, and—when he was suspended for drugs—his teammates. And those are the people we hear from in this film. It\u0027s raw and it\u0027s real. And I\u0027ll be honest, it can be cringe-worthy at times.\u000A\u000AWhy\u0027d you begin the film with the wedding scene? \u000A\u000AGareth Hughes, our wonderful AD on this film, went down to shoot the wedding last August because we thought it could serve as a nice moment to document. But we quickly learned that we were walking into avery dramatic family moment. I\u0027d almost call it a crisis. Once we finished the interviews with his children that weekend, we realized that his relationship with his family and kids was the most compelling and unique thing we\u0027d have in this movie. We\u0027ve heard a million stories about L.T. the football player and we know about his activities off the field. But we\u0027ve never heard from his kids, his ex-wife, and his current wife about what they\u0027ve had to go through with this man. Once we saw what we had that weekend, we knew it was the most compelling way to grab the audience and start the film.\u000A\u000AParcells, Belichick, Simms, Mike Tyson. Oliver Stone. Even Joe Theismann, the man who\u0027s career he essentially ended—they all participated. What is it about this guy that brings out everybody to talk about him? \u000A\u000AThere is something about Lawrence Taylor, that despite all of his flaws and all of his demons, people just have a genuine affection for him. I\u0027ve never seen anything like it. It\u0027s unbelievable. He\u0027s done so many bad things, yet people truly love him. Bill Belichick was an easy get once he knew who the subject was. Bill Parcells was an easy get. Mike Tyson, Michael Strahan—they were all easy gets. Jon Bon Jovi narrates the film. Once he heard it was a documentary on L.T., he was in. We didn\u0027t have to chase anyone down for an interview. Everyone was on board once they heard whom the film was about.\u000A\u000AHow\u0027d the Jon Bon Jovi thing come about?\u000A\u000AHe was my first, second, and third choice to narrate the movie. Honestly, we didn\u0027t have a plan B. He was such a no-brainer for so many reasons. He\u0027s from the era. When Lawrence Taylor was tearing apart the NFL with the Giants, Bon Jovi was selling out stadiums every single night. He\u0027s also from New Jersey. And that\u0027s a fascinating thing about this story. People think of the New York Giants and L.T. and they think it\u0027s a New York City story. But it\u0027s really a New Jersey story. The players played in New Jersey, lived in New Jersey, and actually did most of their partying in New Jersey. And I can\u0027t think of two things that are any more New Jersey than Bon Jovi and the Giants. Of course, the cherry on top is that Jon has an unbelievable voice. A lot of these documentaries, you find a narrator who\u0027s a big name who may fit. But Jon Bon Jovi is a global icon who just so happens to have an amazing voice, as well. He was perfect.\u000A\u000AA lot of people would look at L.T.\u0027s off the field life—drug suspension, bankruptcy, the 2010 underage prostitution charge—and think, I know what I need to know about this guy. What don\u0027t we know that is revealed in this film?\u000A\u000AHis complicated relationship with his family. Not to give too much away, but Lawrence now has a second chance at fatherhood. He\u0027s the most honest athlete I\u0027ve ever met in all of the years I\u0027ve been doing this. He doesn\u0027t sugarcoat anything. He tells you exactly how he feels. Sometimes, it\u0027s uncomfortable. Sometimes, it\u0027s awkward. But watching him with his younger son now, and he\u0027s doing the things he didn\u0027t do with his older children, it\u0027s all incredibly eye-opening.\u000A\u000AHas L.T. seen the film yet? \u000A\u000AHe saw it at the premier Tuesday night for the first time and that was a very scary thing for me. I didn\u0027t know how he would react. We used sound bytes from people that were very harsh towards him. We used others from people very close to him that were brutally honest and quite frankly, not flattering at all. We made the decision to leave it all in there because it was the truth. I\u0027m certain it was uncomfortable at times, of course, but I think he understands. We didn\u0027t pull any punches and to his credit, he knew we had to do that. He gave me a hug after the premier, and that made me feel good, because we were pretty tough on him.",

of<em> LT: The Life and Times</em>, an unapologetic and often brutally honest documentary about the life of troubled former New York Giants superstar Lawrence Taylor, takes place at the recent wedding of Taylor&apos;s daughter. What unfolds is almost unbearable&#x2014;and unforgettable&#x2014;to watch. The NFL Hall-of-Famer arrives expecting to walk his daughter down the aisle, but instead she informs him that it&apos;ll be Taylor and her stepfather sharing the honors. While Taylor angrily vents&#x2014;&quot;I don&apos;t know why I even bothered coming&quot;&#x2014;his daughter tells the camera that LT has always been an absentee father and has never even met her future husband. The sequence sets the stage for everything that follows: a rollercoaster of on-the-field highs and off-the-field lows unparalleled in NFL history. <em>LT: The Life and Times</em>, directed by 27-time Sports Emmy winner Peter Radovich, Jr.,premiers on Showtime at 8pm tonight. GQ spoke with Radovich earlier this week, just after the film&apos;s New York City premier.</p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>After doing &quot;A Game of Honor&quot;, your 2011 documentary about the Army-Navy football rivalry, you chose Lawrence Taylor as your next subject. Fairly different material. Why L.T.?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.5">In the last fifty years in New York City, you&apos;d be hard-pressed finding a bigger personality in sports. Growing up in Queens, in the heyday of the Lawrence Taylor, he became my favorite player and I&apos;ve always been fascinated by him. I just assumed that a documentary on Lawrence Taylor had been already been done. When I did the research, though, I discovered that it hadn&apos;t. I reached out to his agent, and after L.T. said no to us three times, he finally gave us thegreen light.</p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>How&apos;d you go about convincing L.T. to let you document his life in such a raw and honest way?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.7">My pitch to him was, &quot;You&apos;re one of the greatestathletes of all-time. It&apos;d be a shame if there wasn&apos;t a movie documenting your life.&quot; Eventually, after bugging the shit out of him, he saw where I was coming from. But I told him the only way we were doing this was if we covered everything&#x2014;both the good and the bad. We couldn&apos;t do the football and not get into the other stuff, and we certainly couldn&apos;t do the other stuff and not <em>really</em> get into it. Journalistically, I told him I didn&apos;t feel comfortable with him picking and choosing which topics we covered. I told him you&apos;re either all in or we&apos;re not doing this at all. And to Lawrence&apos;s credit, he agreed to those terms and there was nothing that was off-limits. It&apos;s all in there.</p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>When you&apos;ve got such a beloved athlete&#x2014;with so many flaws off of the field&#x2014;how do you balance the professional and personal life in a film?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.9">That was by far and away the greatest challenge facing this project. We felt comfortable editorializing things when it came to his football career. We had no qualms calling him one of the greatest players of all-time and glorifying his life on the playing field. But we were very, very careful not to editorialize and not to pass judgment in any way, shape, or form in everything outside of football. We agreed that it wasn&apos;t our place asfilmmakers to glorify or demonize him. We used the interviews we conducted with everyone in his life to take viewers from point A to point B. Going in, we&apos;d heard time and time again that Lawrence Taylor was a bad guy, a bad father, all of that. But the bottom line, in my opinion, is that he did a lot of bad things, yes...but he hurt very specific people when doing them. He didn&apos;t hurt the people watching the games on TV or the fans that cheered for him on Sundays. The only people he hurt were himself, his family, and&#x2014;when he was suspended for drugs&#x2014;his teammates. And those are the people we hear from in this film. It&apos;s raw and it&apos;s real. And I&apos;ll be honest, it can be cringe-worthy at times.</p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Why&apos;d you begin the film with the wedding scene? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.b">Gareth Hughes, our wonderful AD on this film, went down to shoot the wedding last August because we thought it could serve as a nice moment to document. But we quickly learned that we were walking into avery dramatic family moment. I&apos;d almost call it a crisis. Once we finished the interviews with his children that weekend, we realized that his relationship with his family and kids was the most compelling and unique thing we&apos;d have in this movie. We&apos;ve heard a million stories about L.T. the football player and we know about his activities off the field. But we&apos;ve never heard from his kids, his ex-wife, and his current wife about what they&apos;ve had to go through with this man. Once we saw what we had that weekend, we knew it was the most compelling way to grab the audience and start the film.</p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Parcells, Belichick, Simms, Mike Tyson. Oliver Stone. Even Joe Theismann, the man who&apos;s career he essentially ended&#x2014;they all participated. What is it about this guy that brings out everybody to talk about him? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.d">There is something about Lawrence Taylor, that despite all of his flaws and all of his demons, people just have a genuine affection for him. I&apos;ve never seen anything like it. It&apos;s unbelievable. He&apos;s done so many bad things, yet people truly love him. Bill Belichick was an easy get once he knew who the subject was. Bill Parcells was an easy get. Mike Tyson, Michael Strahan&#x2014;they were all easy gets. Jon Bon Jovi narrates the film. Once he heard it was a documentary on L.T., he was in. We didn&apos;t have to chase anyone down for an interview. Everyone was on board once they heard whom the film was about.</p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>How&apos;d the Jon Bon Jovi thing come about?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.f">He was my first, second, and third choice to narrate the movie. Honestly, we didn&apos;t have a plan B. He was such a no-brainer for so many reasons. He&apos;s from the era. When Lawrence Taylor was tearing apart the NFL with the Giants, Bon Jovi was selling out stadiums every single night. He&apos;s also from New Jersey. And that&apos;s a fascinating thing about this story. People think of the New York Giants and L.T. and they think it&apos;s a New York City story. But it&apos;s really a New Jersey story. The players played in New Jersey, lived in New Jersey, and actually did most of their partying in New Jersey. And I can&apos;t think of two things that are any more New Jersey than Bon Jovi and the Giants. Of course, the cherry on top is that Jon has an unbelievable voice. A lot of these documentaries, you find a narrator who&apos;s a big name who may fit. But Jon Bon Jovi is a global icon who just so happens to have an amazing voice, as well. He was perfect.</p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>A lot of people would look at L.T.&apos;s off the field life&#x2014;drug suspension, bankruptcy, the 2010 underage prostitution charge&#x2014;and think, I know what I need to know about this guy. What don&apos;t we know that is revealed in this film?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.h">His complicated relationship with his family. Not to give too much away, but Lawrence now has a second chance at fatherhood. He&apos;s the most honest athlete I&apos;ve ever met in all of the years I&apos;ve been doing this. He doesn&apos;t sugarcoat anything. He tells you exactly how he feels. Sometimes, it&apos;s uncomfortable. Sometimes, it&apos;s awkward. But watching him with his younger son now, and he&apos;s doing the things he didn&apos;t do with his older children, it&apos;s all incredibly eye-opening.</p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Has L.T. seen the film yet? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.4.j">He saw it at the premier Tuesday night for the first time and that was a very scary thing for me. I didn&apos;t know how he would react. We used sound bytes from people that were very harsh towards him. We used others from people very close to him that were brutally honest and quite frankly, not flattering at all. We made the decision to leave it all in there because it was the truth. I&apos;m certain it was uncomfortable at times, of course, but I think he understands. We didn&apos;t pull any punches and to his credit, he knew we had to do that. He gave me a hug after the premier, and that made me feel good, because we were pretty tough on him.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".s3zm6iovls.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
