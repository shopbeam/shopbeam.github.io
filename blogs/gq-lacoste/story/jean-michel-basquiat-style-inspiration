  	    "articleBody": "There\u0027s video footage, for a long time thought to be the only that existed of Jean-Michel Basquiat, shot in 1982 at his studio on Crosby Street. He\u0027s 21 years old and still basking in the success of his fame-elevating and critically acclaimed museum show at P.S.1 the year before.\u000A\u000AMarc Miller, an art critic, is talking to him, microphone in hand, about the recent reception to his work. Basquiat is wearing a Wesleyan jersey; his hair is dragged up into a pair of lopsided pigtails. Arms crossed, he rocks slightly between the balls and heels of his feet and maintains, for minutes on end, a bored smile.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestThe Art of TweedHerringbone is a lot like Basquiat\u0027s artwork: respected by the uptown swells and the downtown cool kids alike.©Richard Corman/CPi Syndication\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a moment a few minutes into the tape when Miller asks Basquiat to respond to what other critics have called \u0022some sort of primal expressionism.\u0022 Basquiat, still smiling, eyes glassed over in gentle and almost invisible disdain, says, \u0022Like an ape? A primate?\u0022 Miller, surprised and embarrassed, stammers back, \u0022I don\u0027t know.\u0022 Basquiat, voice no louder than before, responds, \u0022You said it, you said it.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe exchange is awful to watch. As a viewer, you\u0027re vicariously offended on behalf of Basquiat and defensive on behalf of Miller (who was, after all, only quoting other people). But the parrying, besides for animating a thicket of issues—ageism, racism, the powerlessness of the journalistic subject, the self-loathing of the critic—also shows, better of course than any still image, Basquiat\u0027s seductive blend of antagonism and comic self-regard. It\u0027s not inconceivable that a person could watch the short video and fall in love with him.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestMake Your Clothes Your CanvasYou can dress like an artist (down to the paint-splattered jeans) even if you\u0027re an accountant. In fact, it\u0027s that throwing it-away spirit that makes it artful.\u000A\u000ALooking at archival photos and footage of Basquiat provokes in the viewer a hyper-awareness that\u0027s immediately familiar to anyone who was uncool in junior high. Nobody has a keener eye for detail than the striving adolescent. They notice how their peers cuff their jeans; where at the ankle they break their track pants; and that it\u0027s somehow possible, on the popular kids, for pimples to seem well-placed. To observe Basquiat, even posthumously, is to remember what it was like to be in the presence of people whose clothes and cadence seemed excruciatingly natural.\u000A\u000AWhere did Basquiat even get his clothes? A denim tank top? A nautical tunic fastened with toggles? Opera-length puka shells? Everything he wore looked borrowed, maybe even found—perfect but impermanent, less clothes than incidental ornament.\u000A\u000AThere is nothing more attractive to a woman than a man who does not shop, whose clothes just happen. A man who appears to be—in the biblical, not the aesthetic ense—immaculately dressed. We all know these men. Often they\u0027re poorly put together: faded socks, oddly fitting pants, one of those weirdly ubiquitous sweaters with the single horizontal stripe across the chest. And that is charming in its own way. But there are also those men, similarly impossible to imagine shopping, who look like aristocrats even in rags. Basquiat was one of them.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestArt WalkBasquiat hits the Comme des Garçons runway in \u002787.\u000A\u000AHis paintings, which now routinely sell for close to $50 million at auction, are beloved for their ease of gesture—a phrase that sounds as though it would appear in a bogus press release but is actually true in the case of Basquiat. With layers of color, smudged text written (and often crossed out) with a ham-fisted hand, frenetic figures drawn with a childlike urgency, and aggressively large canvases, Basquiat\u0027s paintings are, more than most other artists\u0027, impossible to forge. They are so clearly the physical product of a particular person\u0027s energy that the question of whether they are even any good is more or less irrelevant. They are cool—which, in the context of art criticism, is usually a derogatory word meant to imply bad faith, lack of technical ability, or a suspiciously canny understanding of an already insular social order. But why should it mean that? Basquiat\u0027s cool—like Miles Davis\u0027s cool and Lou Reed\u0027s cool—is not incidental to his work: In many ways the two are synonymous.\u000A\u000AFor a century now, at least since Duchamp submitted a urinal as sculpture, art has been, for better or worse, usually nothing more than what a person can convince others is art. And what is that ability if not a certain kind of charisma, a weaponized (and eventually monetized) form of cool? It\u0027s something more magnetic than intelligence, more ambitious than kindness, more confrontational than good taste. It\u0027s an elusive property, but not necessarily one that, in and of itself, is any more rare or complex than what makes a prepubescent kid popular. Basquiat had it, and it\u0027s as evident in his paintings as it was on his body.\u000A\u000ADead, like so many twentieth-century icons, at 27, he seems, especially in retrospect, like a fictional character from a Tom Wolfe novel. Isolated by his celebrity, addicted to heroin, victim to the culture industry\u0027s soft but persistent racism, Basquiat was an on-the-nose embodiment of his era.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestForever SlapdashBasquiat\u0027s tie knot, like his brushstroke, looked beautifully accidental.¬© The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.\u000A\u000AThe son of an accountant, Basquiat was private-school-educated and a junior member of the Brooklyn Museum. His later semi-homelessness and attendant feral appearance were both voluntary and performative. After running away, at the age of 17 (from a three-story brownstone in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, worth about $4 million today), he decamped for downtown Manhattan. He shaved his head into a sort of trompe l\u0027oeil male-pattern balding (\u0022I thought it would be a good disguise\u0022), couch-surfed, and graffitied the city streets with the tag SAMO©. He subsisted on a Cheez Doodles-heavy diet and made a substantial percentage of his paltry income by searching the floor of the Mudd Club for dropped change. It\u0027s a testament to the potency of Basquiat\u0027s flash that he was able to overcome such a biography. I mean, Jesus. Imagine meeting a person like that today.\u000A\u000AThe hardscrabble existence didn\u0027t last long. By 1981, Basquiat had a critically acclaimed solo show, and within only three years his paintings were selling for upwards of $25,000 to S. I. Newhouse, Richard Gere, Paul Simon, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. He was only 23. Basquiat\u0027s youth, which would constitute the entirety of his short life, was almost parodically of-the-moment: He produced a record with Fab 5 Freddy, played in a band with Vincent Gallo, dated Madonna, walked in runway shows for Comme des Garçons, lived with Larry Gagosian, starred in a Blondie music video, and was close friends with Andy Warhol. Any one of these circumstances would be the most memorable of another person\u0027s life. Henry Geldzahler, the late curator of twentieth-century art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, described his \u0022very attractive\u0022 personality as both \u0022charming and disdainful.\u0022 Maripol, the creative director of Fiorucci, recalled that girls were \u0022glued\u0022 to him.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest(Top) The Godfather\u000ABasquiat eventually developed William Burroughs\u0027s taste for heroin. He wouldn\u0027t survive it as long.  (Bottom) Outfit As Music Basquiat (with Francesco Clemente) loved both jazz and absurd clothes. The connection: total spontaneity.  (Right) And Then Tumble Out Into The Night Basquiat painted and partied in the same clothes.\u000A\u000AHe lived like a rapper decades before rappers would have the social capital to name-check his work and the real capital to buy it at auction. Basquiat painted in $800 European suits and threw wads of cash out limousine windows.\u000A\u000AOf course they were. He lived like a rapper decades before rappers would have the social capital to name-check his work and the real capital to buy it at auction. Basquiat painted in—and subsequently ruined—$800 European suits; threw wads of cash out limousine windows; was known to drop $30,000 on drugs in a single night; bought 1961 Lafite at Sherry-Lehmann (\u0022cheaper than drugs\u0022); and drank Kir Royale at Mr. Chow. He had what seems to have been a lifelong propensity for throwing food on authority figures (a cream pie in the face of his high school principal, a bowl of cereal upon the head of a predatory art dealer), and once conducted a studio visit in a girlfriend\u0027s black dress. \u0022There was a period of about a year and a half when it was impossible to wake up in the morning and not hear about Jean-Michel Basquiat,\u0022 gallerist Mary Boone told The New York Times in 1985. When he died of an overdose in 1988, the year after Warhol, his memorial, in Manhattan, was attended by more than 200 people.\u000A\u000AIn an effort to both telegraph cultural savvy and appropriate his effortless style, Reebok released sneakers with his signature chicken scratch, and Supreme has put out shirts and hoodies emblazoned with Basquiat\u0027s iconography.\u000A\u000AThe look he created—in his paintings and his person—didn\u0027t vanish with him; it proliferated. A person could spend years trying to re-create Basquiat\u0027s wardrobe. Many a misguided art-school student probably has. Desired items would include pleated ecru linen pants; a flannel shirt, washed to a mint green blur; a herringbone blazer short in the sleeves; a thin Jimmy Cliff-style polo shirt with a too long placket; one of those oversize black leather jackets that inexplicably brown rather than gray with age. Unsurprisingly, contemporary streetwear brands have attempted to capitalize on—in the most literal of ways—Basquiat\u0027s urban appeal. In an effort to both telegraph cultural savvy and appropriate his effortless style, Reebok released sneakers with his signature chicken scratch, and Supreme has put out shirts and hoodies emblazoned with Basquiat\u0027s iconography.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest(Top) Sartorial Expressionism. Basquiat\u0027s derelict look—and lifestyle—wasn\u0027t real, exactly. Nor was it a pose. It was all part of his life-as-art-project approach to existence.  (Bottom) Undone Ivy. Next to John Sex and Keith Haring, Jean-Michel looked like a Princeton student on a downtown bender.   (Right) The Andy Effect. Warhol made conservative clothes feel rebellious. And Basquiat pushed that idea further toward the edge.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a sad but true fact of the world that, just as anything looks good on a thin woman, anything looks good on a confident man—even, regrettably, heroin-induced skin lesions, tooth rot, and bloat. Picture Basquiat—paint-splattered, smiling—jaywalking across Broadway with a pocketful of singles supplied by his first gallerist, Annina Nosei, to get lunch at Dean &amp; DeLuca. Or better yet, with a bouquet of lilacs en route to Bianca Jagger\u0027s birthday party. Before he himself would become an icon, Basquiat painted them: kings, athletes, warriors. And like them, he was coronated. Though his dreadlocks changed length, from aloe-like spikes to horns to bramble, he is best remembered as existing beneath a head of hair that looked like nothing so much as a crown.\u000A\u000AAnd like King Midas, who could turn anything he touched to gold, Basquiat was capable of transferring his magic aura not only to canvas but to completely arbitrary items. A suede Jacuru hat on his head, a tiger-print bandanna around his neck, even a docile Siamese cat in his lap—all are anointed merely by being chosen by him.",

Basquiat is wearing a Wesleyan jersey; his hair is dragged up into a pair of lopsided pigtails. Arms crossed, he rocks slightly between the balls and heels of his feet and maintains, for minutes on end, a bored smile.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.2"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55f9d7e6b031e5832b064f19/master/w_600/SIP-Basquiat-01.jpg" alt="SIP-Basquiat-01.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIP-Basquiat-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIP-Basquiat-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f9d7e6b031e5832b064f19%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIP-Basquiat-01.jpg&amp;description=SIP-Basquiat-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f9d7e6b031e5832b064f19%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIP-Basquiat-01.jpg&amp;description=SIP-Basquiat-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p><strong>The Art of Tweed</strong><br>Herringbone is a lot like Basquiat&#x2019;s artwork: respected by the uptown swells and the downtown cool kids alike.</p></span><div class="credits">&#xA9;Richard Corman/CPi Syndication</div></figcaption></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.3">There&apos;s a moment a few minutes into the tape when Miller asks Basquiat to respond to what other critics have called &#x201C;some sort of primal expressionism.&#x201D; Basquiat, still smiling, eyes glassed over in gentle and almost invisible disdain, says, &#x201C;Like an ape? A primate?&#x201D; Miller, surprised and embarrassed, stammers back, &#x201C;I don&apos;t know.&#x201D; Basquiat, voice no louder than before, responds, &#x201C;You said it, you said it.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.5">The exchange is awful to watch. As a viewer, you&apos;re vicariously offended on behalf of Basquiat and defensive on behalf of Miller (who was, after all, only quoting other people). But the parrying, besides for animating a thicket of issues&#x2014;ageism, racism, the powerlessness of the journalistic subject, the self-loathing of the critic&#x2014;also shows, better of course than any still image, Basquiat&apos;s seductive blend of antagonism and comic self-regard. It&apos;s not inconceivable that a person could watch the short video and fall in love with him.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.6"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55f9d7e6b031e5832b064f16/master/w_600/SIP-Basquiat-02.jpg" alt="SIP-Basquiat-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIP-Basquiat-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIP-Basquiat-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f9d7e6b031e5832b064f16%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIP-Basquiat-02.jpg&amp;description=SIP-Basquiat-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f9d7e6b031e5832b064f16%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIP-Basquiat-02.jpg&amp;description=SIP-Basquiat-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p><strong>Make Your Clothes Your Canvas</strong><br>You can dress like an artist (down to the paint-splattered jeans) even if you&#x2019;re an accountant.

Nobody has a keener eye for detail than the striving adolescent. They notice how their peers cuff their jeans; where at the ankle they break their track pants; and that it&apos;s somehow possible, on the popular kids, for pimples to seem well-placed. To observe Basquiat, even posthumously, is to remember what it was like to be in the presence of people whose clothes and cadence seemed excruciatingly natural.</p><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.8">Where did Basquiat even <em>get</em> his clothes? A denim tank top? A nautical tunic fastened with toggles? Opera-length puka shells? Everything he wore looked borrowed, maybe even found&#x2014;perfect but impermanent, less clothes than incidental ornament.</p><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.9">There is nothing more attractive to a woman than a man who does not shop, whose clothes just <em>happen.</em> A man who appears to be&#x2014;in the biblical, not the aesthetic ense&#x2014;immaculately dressed. We all know these men. Often they&apos;re poorly put together: faded socks, oddly fitting pants, one of those weirdly ubiquitous sweaters with the single horizontal stripe across the chest. And that is charming in its own way. But there are also those men, similarly impossible to imagine shopping, who look like aristocrats even in rags. Basquiat was one of them.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.a"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55fb069b182edca8060a6268/master/w_600/SIPBasquiantstyle2images.jpg" alt="SIPBasquiantstyle2images.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIPBasquiantstyle2images.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIPBasquiantstyle2images.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55fb069b182edca8060a6268%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIPBasquiantstyle2images.jpg&amp;description=SIPBasquiantstyle2images.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55fb069b182edca8060a6268%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIPBasquiantstyle2images.jpg&amp;description=SIPBasquiantstyle2images.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p><strong>Art Walk</strong><br>Basquiat hits the Comme des Gar&#xE7;ons runway in &#x2019;87.</p></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.b">His paintings, which now routinely sell for close to $50 million at auction, are beloved for their <em>ease of gesture</em>&#x2014;a phrase that sounds as though it would appear in a bogus press release but is actually true in the case of Basquiat. With layers of color, smudged text written (and often crossed out) with a ham-fisted hand, frenetic figures drawn with a childlike urgency, and aggressively large canvases, Basquiat&apos;s paintings are, more than most other artists&apos;, impossible to forge. They are so clearly the physical product of a particular person&apos;s energy that the question of whether they are even any good is more or less irrelevant. They are <em>cool</em>&#x2014;which, in the context of art criticism, is usually a derogatory word meant to imply bad faith, lack of technical ability, or a suspiciously canny understanding of an already insular social order. But why should it mean that? Basquiat&apos;s cool&#x2014;like Miles Davis&apos;s cool and Lou Reed&apos;s cool&#x2014;is not incidental to his work: In many ways the two are synonymous.</p><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.c">For a century now, at least since Duchamp submitted a urinal as sculpture, art has been, for better or worse, usually nothing more than what a person can convince others is art. And what is that ability if not a certain kind of charisma, a weaponized (and eventually monetized) form of cool? It&apos;s something more magnetic than intelligence, more ambitious than kindness, more confrontational than good taste. It&apos;s an elusive property, but not necessarily one that, in and of itself, is any more rare or complex than what makes a prepubescent kid popular. Basquiat had it, and it&apos;s as evident in his paintings as it was on his body.</p><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.d">Dead, like so many twentieth-century icons, at 27, he seems, especially in retrospect, like a fictional character from a Tom Wolfe novel. Isolated by his celebrity, addicted to heroin, victim to the culture industry&apos;s soft but persistent racism, Basquiat was an on-the-nose embodiment of his era.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.e"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55f9d7e72de2e54e38607855/master/w_806/SIP-Basquiat-03.jpg" alt="SIP-Basquiat-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIP-Basquiat-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIP-Basquiat-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f9d7e72de2e54e38607855%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIP-Basquiat-03.jpg&amp;description=SIP-Basquiat-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f9d7e72de2e54e38607855%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIP-Basquiat-03.jpg&amp;description=SIP-Basquiat-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p><strong>Forever Slapdash</strong><br>Basquiat&#x2019;s tie knot, like his brushstroke, looked beautifully accidental.</p></span><div class="credits">&#xAC;&#xA9; The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc.</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.f">The son of an accountant, Basquiat was private-school-educated and a junior member of the Brooklyn Museum. His later semi-homelessness and attendant feral appearance were both voluntary and performative. After running away, at the age of 17 (from a three-story brownstone in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, worth about $4 million today), he decamped for downtown Manhattan. He shaved his head into a sort of trompe l&apos;oeil male-pattern balding (&#x201C;I thought it would be a good disguise&#x201D;), couch-surfed, and graffitied the city streets with the tag SAMO&#xA9;. He subsisted on a Cheez Doodles-heavy diet and made a substantial percentage of his paltry income by searching the floor of the Mudd Club for dropped change. It&apos;s a testament to the potency of Basquiat&apos;s flash that he was able to overcome such a biography. I mean, Jesus. Imagine meeting a person like that today.</p><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.g">The hardscrabble existence didn&apos;t last long. By 1981, Basquiat had a critically acclaimed solo show, and within only three years his paintings were selling for upwards of $25,000 to S. I. Newhouse, Richard Gere, Paul Simon, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. He was only 23. Basquiat&apos;s youth, which would constitute the entirety of his short life, was almost parodically of-the-moment: He produced a record with Fab 5 Freddy, played in a band with Vincent Gallo, dated Madonna, walked in runway shows for Comme des Gar&#xE7;ons, lived with Larry Gagosian, starred in a Blondie music video, and was close friends with Andy Warhol. Any one of these circumstances would be the most memorable of another person&apos;s life. Henry Geldzahler, the late curator of twentieth-century art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, described his &#x201C;very attractive&#x201D; personality as both &#x201C;charming and disdainful.&#x201D; Maripol, the creative director of Fiorucci, recalled that girls were &#x201C;glued&#x201D; to him.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.h"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55fb0698c5022b32114fd120/master/w_806/SIPBasquiant3images.jpg" alt="SIPBasquiant3images.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIPBasquiant3images.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIPBasquiant3images.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55fb0698c5022b32114fd120%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIPBasquiant3images.jpg&amp;description=SIPBasquiant3images.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55fb0698c5022b32114fd120%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIPBasquiant3images.jpg&amp;description=SIPBasquiant3images.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><ol><li>(Top) <strong>The Godfather</strong>

He lived like a rapper decades before rappers would have the social capital to name-check his work and the real capital to buy it at auction. Basquiat painted in&#x2014;and subsequently ruined&#x2014;$800 European suits; threw wads of cash out limousine windows; was known to drop $30,000 on drugs in a single night; bought 1961 Lafite at Sherry-Lehmann (&#x201C;cheaper than drugs&#x201D;); and drank Kir Royale at Mr. Chow. He had what seems to have been a lifelong propensity for throwing food on authority figures (a cream pie in the face of his high school principal, a bowl of cereal upon the head of a predatory art dealer), and once conducted a studio visit in a girlfriend&apos;s black dress. &#x201C;There was a period of about a year and a half when it was impossible to wake up in the morning and not hear about Jean-Michel Basquiat,&#x201D; gallerist Mary Boone told <em>The New York Times</em> in 1985. When he died of an overdose in 1988, the year after Warhol, his memorial, in Manhattan, was attended by more than 200 people.</p><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.k">In an effort to both telegraph cultural savvy and appropriate his effortless style, Reebok released sneakers with his signature chicken scratch, and Supreme has put out shirts and hoodies emblazoned with Basquiat&apos;s iconography.</p><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.l">The look he created&#x2014;in his paintings and his person&#x2014;didn&apos;t vanish with him; it proliferated. A person could spend years trying to re-create Basquiat&apos;s wardrobe. Many a misguided art-school student probably has. Desired items would include pleated ecru linen pants; a flannel shirt, washed to a mint green blur; a herringbone blazer short in the sleeves; a thin Jimmy Cliff-style polo shirt with a too long placket; one of those oversize black leather jackets that inexplicably brown rather than gray with age. Unsurprisingly, contemporary streetwear brands have attempted to capitalize on&#x2014;in the most literal of ways&#x2014;Basquiat&apos;s urban appeal. In an effort to both telegraph cultural savvy and appropriate his effortless style, Reebok released sneakers with his signature chicken scratch, and Supreme has put out shirts and hoodies emblazoned with Basquiat&apos;s iconography.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.m"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55fb0699182edca8060a6263/master/w_806/SIPBasquiant3imagespart2.jpg" alt="SIPBasquiant3imagespart2.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIPBasquiant3imagespart2.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;t=SIPBasquiant3imagespart2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55fb0699182edca8060a6263%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIPBasquiant3imagespart2.jpg&amp;description=SIPBasquiant3imagespart2.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjean-michel-basquiat-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55fb0699182edca8060a6263%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSIPBasquiant3imagespart2.jpg&amp;description=SIPBasquiant3imagespart2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><ol><li>(Top) <strong>Sartorial Expressionism</strong>.

Picture Basquiat&#x2014;paint-splattered, smiling&#x2014;jaywalking across Broadway with a pocketful of singles supplied by his first gallerist, Annina Nosei, to get lunch at Dean &amp; DeLuca. Or better yet, with a bouquet of lilacs en route to Bianca Jagger&apos;s birthday party. Before he himself would become an icon, Basquiat painted them: kings, athletes, warriors. And like them, he was coronated. Though his dreadlocks changed length, from aloe-like spikes to horns to bramble, he is best remembered as existing beneath a head of hair that looked like nothing so much as a crown.</p><p data-reactid=".a1ux23bm68.1.1.0.0.4.o">And like King Midas, who could turn anything he touched to gold, Basquiat was capable of transferring his magic aura not only to canvas but to completely arbitrary items. A suede Jacuru hat on his head, a tiger-print bandanna around his neck, even a docile Siamese cat in his lap&#x2014;all are anointed merely by being chosen by him.</p></div><div class="grid"
