  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestPhoto: BEAWIHARTA/Newscom\u000A\u000AIn Bali they say it is time to get clean.\u000A\u000AColonel Sanders is sad and has a banner saying so draped across the KFC. The hundreds of T-shirt and souvenir stalls lining Poppies Lane stare out like broken teeth, without a single customer. Near the hole in the ground where the Sari Club used to be, a sign in one store advises WE &amp;#x2665; BALI! START AGAIN. At a huge video arcade called the Time Zone, the uniformed staff are the only people playing the machines. They stare grimly into the screens and point automatic weapons at electronic enemies. It is late October, and two weeks ago terrorist attacks redrew the map of the world for the Balinese. The Time Zone banner rattles on about how \u0022the horrible tragedy on October 12th 2002 has only given us the deepest sorrow and the anxiety. Always be aware and take a prayer is the only way to avoid the same tragedy.\u0022 Outside, at a table, the police keep a collection bowl for the injured. The tablecloth drapes to the ground, and someone has spray-painted on the fabric fuck terrorists. The air sags with humidity and with incense from the countless canangs—little trays with burning sticks of scent, flower petals and some food, a bit of bread, a cookie, all to beckon the Hindu gods to the miseries of men.\u000A\u000AAn Aussie talks softly, everyone speaks very softly at this particular place, as he tells me of four girls who were sitting over there, see, he points, there. And I look and see a bare wall across the rubble with the sun beating down in the afternoon heat. The Sari Club, a legendary watering hole at Kuta Beach, was full, he explains, and there were these four girls there and one went to the bathroom and the other three stayed at the table. And&amp;he pauses, his face beaded with sweat, his shirtless chest red from the sun. The bathroom is kind of intact: a door hanging on one hinge and one wall blown away, but still almost solid looking amid the rubble. Toward the back of the club, a tower of Coca-Cola remains, the full glass bottles still beaming, the red plastic cases a molten mass flowing downward. A hot time in the old town tonight. But...did the girl who went to the bathroom survive? He does not go on, just stares at the rubble.\u000A\u000AOn the evening of October 12, three bombs went off in a fifty-five-second span and killed close to 200 people and injured about 300. The first one exploded in Paddy\u0027s Irish Pub, a stout, two-story structure that now lacks a roof and hosts a mezzanine of charred cocktail tables and a gutted ground floor. People fled out into the street. Then the second bomb exploded in a van parked in front of the Sari Club, an open-air bar with various thatched ramadas catty-corner to Paddy\u0027s. The place was full of hot young flesh out on a Saturday night—mostly Australians with some Europeans and a few Americans—and they were caught in the second blast. And then a third bomb went off near the U.S. consulate.\u000A\u000AThe van that was parked outside Sari is now more than forty pieces of contorted metal recovered by forensic experts. Or the van is a hole about twelve feet across and several feet deep that gouges into what was once the street. Police now think the van was parked for only sixty or 120 seconds before detonation. In the bar business, it is location, location, location. In the bomb business, like comedy, much depends upon timing. The damage runs to seventeen cars, 450 buildings (seventeen completely destroyed) and a price tag of 480 billion rupiah ($52 million). And then there is the other casualty: tourism. Hotels, if they are open, are running single-digit occupancy. Many Indonesians already on the edge will be forced into poverty as a result of the collapse of the industry. Because after the blast, two things happened: Parents flooded in from Australia looking for their children. And the children fled Bali, looking for bars without bombs.\u000A\u000AThe news reports have spread the word, how the authorities believe the bombs were the work of radical Muslims linked to Al Qaeda. Abu Bakar Bashir, an old man with a bad heart who is said to be the head of Jemaah Islamiah, the Indonesian branch office of Al Qaeda, denies that his organization exists and identifies the bombers as the usual suspects: the United States and Israel. Many Indonesians have also been floating the notion—to the great ire of the U.S. ambassador—that the U.S. was behind the bombing as part of a grand conspiracy to further extend its war on terror. They point out that the explosive used is made in America.\u000A\u000AThe Balinese are baffled, preoccupied not so much by who did it as by how it could happen here. Bali is a Hindu island in the Muslim sea of Indonesia, and the bombs do not mix well with the local flower petals and incense. Everywhere on Kuta are small shrines and temples. Religion is woven into life here. The bombs tore this life to shreds.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThis is not where history was supposed to take the Balinese, but then again, Bali has always had surprise visitors. In 1962 rats suddenly arrived here. Then, in the late \u002760s, young backpackers with appetites and small change found Bali. Soon the island joined a trail that strung together Goa and Kathmandu and Bangkok as stations of some new, friendly cross. Huge hotels erupted out of the little peninsula, and tourism became the Balinese economy. By the end of the millennium, up to 5,000 people were arriving each day for the beaches and the clubs.\u000A\u000ANow arrivals are down to a thousand or so—the diehards of party time. On Halloween weekend, the government in Jakarta flew in a thousand celebrities to brighten Kuta and prove it was back to normal and everything was OK. One government official from the capital asked me, \u0022Why don\u0027t tourists come?\u0022 I said, \u0022People don\u0027t like to have a drink and a bomb at the same time.\u0022 He looked almost hurt by the answer.\u000A\u000APeople pass shared stories of luck and survival. Mark Jackson, an Englishman of 25, had been coming to Bali to surf for six years. Finally, on one visit, he opened an Internet café but kept his job back home recruiting for a high-tech computer company. Then, in the summer of 2002, he surrendered to the island and moved here for keeps. On the night of October 12, he was about to go into Paddy\u0027s for a drink when he ran into a friend out front who was playing Guns N\u0027 Roses-style rock \u0027n\u0027 roll in a band down the street. So he tagged along for his set. Fifteen minutes later, the first bomb felt to him a little like the earthquakes that regularly ripple through Bali. The second bomb lifted him out of his chair. \u0022It was the loudest noise I\u0027ve ever heard,\u0022 he says. Part of the room caved in, and when he went into the street, people were streaming past, out of the smoke. One man raced by with his severed arm dangling and shouted, \u0022Bomb! Bomb!\u0022 A man leaped from the second floor of Paddy\u0027s and died on the street. Jackson winces as he remembers. He went to his nearby hotel to make sure his five roommates were OK. The window was blown in, and they were absent. He worried they\u0027d been in the Sari Club. In the morning, he found they\u0027d been boozing safely on the beach.\u000A\u000AJackson looks at the rubble and cannot make sense of his luck. He was going into Paddy\u0027s, then went down the block a few doors for the music. It was that close. Jackson thinks the tourists will eventually return, though he has put on hold his plan to open a bar. But he\u0027s sure the young will want to come back. He says the targets are symbols, you know, and now Bali is used up. Besides, no place is safe, anyway.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s the rub here. It is difficult for surfers with tattoos, generous thirsts, open lusts and eager habits to connect terrorism with themselves. They thought they had left a world that has now found them out in paradise. But that paradise has always existed in a very slim corridor—in Bali it is mostly Kuta Beach, the club belt where the young pant and booze and surf and laugh. (For years only foreigners were allowed in the Sari Club. Management had banned the Balinese to cut down hustling by prostitutes who took up space but did not spend enough money.)\u000A\u000AAnd so the ones who keep coming cannot put it all together. Like the Aussie at the rubble. He has fallen silent, his lips a thin line with beads of sweat. He stares at the old Sari Club where the four women sat, one leaving to go to the bathroom, three staying at the table. Now, at the site, a few pieces of iron maybe thirty feet high have been propped up in a conscious echo of the surviving girders at the World Trade Center after September 11. The few tourists here refer to the site as Ground Zero, a new kind of landmark for modern travelers.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AA wine bar beckons, one that blossomed on July 4, 2002. There are no other customers as I sit and drink an Australian Cabernet. Ari, the 30-year-old bartender, says proudly, \u0022In Kuta there is no wine bar. We are pioneers. We are the future.\u0022 For being part of the future, he makes about forty bucks a month, plus a bonus if business is good. Business is no longer good. He has a wife, a daughter, a room, motorcycle, television, refrigerator and CD player. He says, \u0022Bali is like sugar, the best place to work, to get a better life.\u0022 When the bombs went off, he at first thought his propane tank had blown. Then people came running past shouting, \u0022Bomb! Bomb!\u0022 Two days later, Ari went to the hospital and saw the corpses. \u0022I not stay long there,\u0022 he continues. \u0022I can\u0027t see, I can\u0027t see. A corpse, all burned without hands. Oh God. I can\u0027t see.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe is insistent about the need for purification. He has friends who live near the bomb site, and in the weeks after the blast they heard screams in the night. Ceremonies had to be done, he says, so the dead would leave and be quiet about it.\u000A\u000ANobody here is talking about building memorials—statues or artwork for the fallen. Hardly anyone is talking about vengeance either. The Bali approach has been self-critical—something has gone wrong with our moral universe—and the solution is self-cleansing. We must pray, atone, make right again.\u000A\u000AThe Balinese have refused to let the rubble stay on land and insisted it be dumped at sea. The rubble is spiritually dirty, they believe, because it is commingled with the residue of people who died violently. Piles of floral wreaths heap against the rubble. Hindu holy squads in silken sarongs come regularly to pray for the dead, to beg their wounded souls to leave and go in peace.\u000A\u000AOn November 15, the ceremony was set. Hindu priests throughout Bali recommended a mass cremation for the dead, and hotel management supported this decision. The local paper contends that \u0022the hectic appeal of materialism offered by the tourism business has made many&amp;ignore the laws stipulated by God Almighty.\u0022 For the cleansing, a Buta Yadnya rite was called for in two forms: one that was performed at Ground Zero and another that is often done in holy places. The first asked the dead not to succumb to bad powers; the second asked forgiveness for the sins of the Balinese people. It was worth a shot.\u000A\u000AAmid the rubble, Balinese purification makes sense: Heal the living, give the dead peace, clean the ground, seek harmony, go forward. Compare this with the architectural, political and memorial dustup going on over what to do with the big hole in New York\u0027s soul.\u000A\u000AIn New York or Bali, the rubble never measures up to the pain. The hole in the ground is never big enough for the new hole in the heart. The ghosts linger, the sun beats down, and there are no words good enough. Here are the lessons: You cannot be safe. You cannot give in, because no one will accept your surrender. But just maybe, you can be clean, if you do the right ceremonies.\u000A\u000AThe Aussie with his tale of four girls in the Sari Club—the one who goes to the bathroom while the others stay at their table that night with the music loud, the room packed with happy people, the beer cold, the bodies hot and red—well, he never really finishes his story as he squints in the afternoon sun and stares at the broken concrete, twisted beams, gutted cars and small chunks of what was party time. Besides, he arrived three days after the bombing. The story is just something he heard. He drifts off, his voice fading like a dying radio. Because it does not matter which girls lived and which girls died that night.\u000A\u000AThere is no right decision, no sin, no path not taken, no mistake. You are going into Paddy\u0027s Pub, and suddenly a friend says, \u0022Hey, mate, come listen to me play down the street.\u0022 There is music in the air, then, the loudest sound you have ever heard. Then, screams. First New York. Now here. Tomorrow, who knows?\u000A\u000AAfter all, it\u0027s a road show.\u000A\u000ACharles Bowden is a GQ correspondent.",

the evening of October 12, three bombs went off in a fifty-five-second span and killed close to 200 people and injured about 300. The Balinese were baffled, preoccupied not so much by who did it as by how it could happen here. Bali is a Hindu island in the Muslim sea of Indonesia, and the bombs do not mix well with the local flower petals and incense. Everywhere on Kuta are small shrines and temples.

The hundreds of T-shirt and souvenir stalls lining Poppies Lane stare out like broken teeth, without a single customer. Near the hole in the ground where the Sari Club used to be, a sign in one store advises WE &amp;#x2665; BALI! START AGAIN. At a huge video arcade called the Time Zone, the uniformed staff are the only people playing the machines. They stare grimly into the screens and point automatic weapons at electronic enemies. It is late October, and two weeks ago terrorist attacks redrew the map of the world for the Balinese. The Time Zone banner rattles on about how &quot;the horrible tragedy on October 12th 2002 has only given us the deepest sorrow and the anxiety. Always be aware and take a prayer is the only way to avoid the same tragedy.&quot; Outside, at a table, the police keep a collection bowl for the injured. The tablecloth drapes to the ground, and someone has spray-painted on the fabric fuck terrorists. The air sags with humidity and with incense from the countless <em>canangs</em>&#x2014;little trays with burning sticks of scent, flower petals and some food, a bit of bread, a cookie, all to beckon the Hindu gods to the miseries of men.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.3">An Aussie talks softly, everyone speaks very softly at this particular place, as he tells me of four girls who were sitting over there, see, he points, there. And I look and see a bare wall across the rubble with the sun beating down in the afternoon heat. The Sari Club, a legendary watering hole at Kuta Beach, was full, he explains, and there were these four girls there and one went to the bathroom and the other three stayed at the table. And&amp;he pauses, his face beaded with sweat, his shirtless chest red from the sun. The bathroom is kind of intact: a door hanging on one hinge and one wall blown away, but still almost solid looking amid the rubble. Toward the back of the club, a tower of Coca-Cola remains, the full glass bottles still beaming, the red plastic cases a molten mass flowing downward. A hot time in the old town tonight. But...did the girl who went to the bathroom survive? He does not go on, just stares at the rubble.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.5">On the evening of October 12, three bombs went off in a fifty-five-second span and killed close to 200 people and injured about 300. The first one exploded in Paddy&#x2019;s Irish Pub, a stout, two-story structure that now lacks a roof and hosts a mezzanine of charred cocktail tables and a gutted ground floor. People fled out into the street. Then the second bomb exploded in a van parked in front of the Sari Club, an open-air bar with various thatched ramadas catty-corner to Paddy&#x2019;s. The place was full of hot young flesh out on a Saturday night&#x2014;mostly Australians with some Europeans and a few Americans&#x2014;and they were caught in the second blast. And then a third bomb went off near the U.S. consulate.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.6">The van that was parked outside Sari is now more than forty pieces of contorted metal recovered by forensic experts. Or the van is a hole about twelve feet across and several feet deep that gouges into what was once the street. Police now think the van was parked for only sixty or 120 seconds before detonation. In the bar business, it is location, location, location. In the bomb business, like comedy, much depends upon timing. The damage runs to seventeen cars, 450 buildings (seventeen completely destroyed) and a price tag of 480 billion rupiah ($52 million). And then there is the other casualty: tourism. Hotels, if they are open, are running single-digit occupancy. Many Indonesians already on the edge will be forced into poverty as a result of the collapse of the industry. Because after the blast, two things happened: Parents flooded in from Australia looking for their children. And the children fled Bali, looking for bars without bombs.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.7">The news reports have spread the word, how the authorities believe the bombs were the work of radical Muslims linked to Al Qaeda. Abu Bakar Bashir, an old man with a bad heart who is said to be the head of Jemaah Islamiah, the Indonesian branch office of Al Qaeda, denies that his organization exists and identifies the bombers as the usual suspects: the United States and Israel. Many Indonesians have also been floating the notion&#x2014;to the great ire of the U.S. ambassador&#x2014;that the U.S. was behind the bombing as part of a grand conspiracy to further extend its war on terror. They point out that the explosive used is made in America.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.8">The Balinese are baffled, preoccupied not so much by who did it as by how it could happen here. Bali is a Hindu island in the Muslim sea of Indonesia, and the bombs do not mix well with the local flower petals and incense. Everywhere on Kuta are small shrines and temples. Religion is woven into life here. The bombs tore this life to shreds.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.9"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.a">This is not where history was supposed to take the Balinese, but then again, Bali has always had surprise visitors. In 1962 rats suddenly arrived here. Then, in the late &#x2019;60s, young backpackers with appetites and small change found Bali. Soon the island joined a trail that strung together Goa and Kathmandu and Bangkok as stations of some new, friendly cross. Huge hotels erupted out of the little peninsula, and tourism became the Balinese economy. By the end of the millennium, up to 5,000 people were arriving each day for the beaches and the clubs.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.b">Now arrivals are down to a thousand or so&#x2014;the diehards of party time. On Halloween weekend, the government in Jakarta flew in a thousand celebrities to brighten Kuta and prove it was back to normal and everything was OK. One government official from the capital asked me, &quot;Why don&#x2019;t tourists come?&quot; I said, &quot;People don&#x2019;t like to have a drink and a bomb at the same time.&quot; He looked almost hurt by the answer.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>People pass</strong> shared stories of luck and survival. Mark Jackson, an Englishman of 25, had been coming to Bali to surf for six years. Finally, on one visit, he opened an Internet caf&#xE9; but kept his job back home recruiting for a high-tech computer company. Then, in the summer of 2002, he surrendered to the island and moved here for keeps. On the night of October 12, he was about to go into Paddy&#x2019;s for a drink when he ran into a friend out front who was playing Guns N&#x2019; Roses-style rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll in a band down the street. So he tagged along for his set. Fifteen minutes later, the first bomb felt to him a little like the earthquakes that regularly ripple through Bali. The second bomb lifted him out of his chair. &quot;It was the loudest noise I&#x2019;ve ever heard,&quot; he says. Part of the room caved in, and when he went into the street, people were streaming past, out of the smoke. One man raced by with his severed arm dangling and shouted, &quot;Bomb! Bomb!&quot; A man leaped from the second floor of Paddy&#x2019;s and died on the street. Jackson winces as he remembers. He went to his nearby hotel to make sure his five roommates were OK. The window was blown in, and they were absent. He worried they&#x2019;d been in the Sari Club. In the morning, he found they&#x2019;d been boozing safely on the beach.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.d">Jackson looks at the rubble and cannot make sense of his luck. He was going into Paddy&#x2019;s, then went down the block a few doors for the music. It was that close. Jackson thinks the tourists will eventually return, though he has put on hold his plan to open a bar. But he&#x2019;s sure the young will want to come back. He says the targets are symbols, you know, and now Bali is used up. Besides, no place is safe, anyway.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.e">That&#x2019;s the rub here. It is difficult for surfers with tattoos, generous thirsts, open lusts and eager habits to connect terrorism with themselves. They thought they had left a world that has now found them out in paradise. But that paradise has always existed in a very slim corridor&#x2014;in Bali it is mostly Kuta Beach, the club belt where the young pant and booze and surf and laugh. (For years only foreigners were allowed in the Sari Club. Management had banned the Balinese to cut down hustling by prostitutes who took up space but did not spend enough money.)</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.f">And so the ones who keep coming cannot put it all together. Like the Aussie at the rubble. He has fallen silent, his lips a thin line with beads of sweat. He stares at the old Sari Club where the four women sat, one leaving to go to the bathroom, three staying at the table. Now, at the site, a few pieces of iron maybe thirty feet high have been propped up in a conscious echo of the surviving girders at the World Trade Center after September 11. The few tourists here refer to the site as Ground Zero, a new kind of landmark for modern travelers.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.g"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>A wine bar</strong> beckons, one that blossomed on July 4, 2002. There are no other customers as I sit and drink an Australian Cabernet. Ari, the 30-year-old bartender, says proudly, &quot;In Kuta there is no wine bar. We are pioneers. We are the future.&quot; For being part of the future, he makes about forty bucks a month, plus a bonus if business is good. Business is no longer good. He has a wife, a daughter, a room, motorcycle, television, refrigerator and CD player. He says, &quot;Bali is like sugar, the best place to work, to get a better life.&quot; When the bombs went off, he at first thought his propane tank had blown. Then people came running past shouting, &quot;Bomb! Bomb!&quot; Two days later, Ari went to the hospital and saw the corpses. &quot;I not stay long there,&quot; he continues. &quot;I can&#x2019;t see, I can&#x2019;t see. A corpse, all burned without hands. Oh God. I can&#x2019;t see.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.i">He is insistent about the need for purification. He has friends who live near the bomb site, and in the weeks after the blast they heard screams in the night. Ceremonies had to be done, he says, so the dead would leave and be quiet about it.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.j">Nobody here is talking about building memorials&#x2014;statues or artwork for the fallen. Hardly anyone is talking about vengeance either. The Bali approach has been self-critical&#x2014;something has gone wrong with our moral universe&#x2014;and the solution is self-cleansing. We must pray, atone, make right again.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.k">The Balinese have refused to let the rubble stay on land and insisted it be dumped at sea. The rubble is spiritually dirty, they believe, because it is commingled with the residue of people who died violently. Piles of floral wreaths heap against the rubble. Hindu holy squads in silken sarongs come regularly to pray for the dead, to beg their wounded souls to leave and go in peace.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.l">On November 15, the ceremony was set. Hindu priests throughout Bali recommended a mass cremation for the dead, and hotel management supported this decision. The local paper contends that &quot;the hectic appeal of materialism offered by the tourism business has made many&amp;ignore the laws stipulated by God Almighty.&quot; For the cleansing, a Buta Yadnya rite was called for in two forms: one that was performed at Ground Zero and another that is often done in holy places. The first asked the dead not to succumb to bad powers; the second asked forgiveness for the sins of the Balinese people. It was worth a shot.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.m">Amid the rubble, Balinese purification makes sense: Heal the living, give the dead peace, clean the ground, seek harmony, go forward. Compare this with the architectural, political and memorial dustup going on over what to do with the big hole in New York&#x2019;s soul.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.n">In New York or Bali, the rubble never measures up to the pain. The hole in the ground is never big enough for the new hole in the heart. The ghosts linger, the sun beats down, and there are no words good enough. Here are the lessons: You cannot be safe. You cannot give in, because no one will accept your surrender. But just maybe, you can be clean, if you do the right ceremonies.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.o">The Aussie with his tale of four girls in the Sari Club&#x2014;the one who goes to the bathroom while the others stay at their table that night with the music loud, the room packed with happy people, the beer cold, the bodies hot and red&#x2014;well, he never really finishes his story as he squints in the afternoon sun and stares at the broken concrete, twisted beams, gutted cars and small chunks of what was party time. Besides, he arrived three days after the bombing. The story is just something he heard. He drifts off, his voice fading like a dying radio. Because it does not matter which girls lived and which girls died that night.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.p">There is no right decision, no sin, no path not taken, no mistake. You are going into Paddy&#x2019;s Pub, and suddenly a friend says, &quot;Hey, mate, come listen to me play down the street.&quot; There is music in the air, then, the loudest sound you have ever heard. Then, screams. First New York. Now here. Tomorrow, who knows?</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.q">After all, it&#x2019;s a road show.</p><p data-reactid=".1657bav6jnk.1.1.0.0.4.r"><a
