But when the final season of Mad Men draws to a close, that cocky, depressive adman that Jon Hamm made—and that made Jon Hamm—is going to disappear. Which means two things: It\u0027s time to sit down and savor that character\u0027s closing notes, and then it\u0027s time to get excited for everything Jon Hamm is going to do next\u000A\u000A Jon Hamm: Mastery of Suit Fundamentals\u000A\u000A1. FUNNY MAN\u000A\u000AThe last time I spent a day in Los Angeles with Jon Hamm was a long Hollywood journey ago. Mad Men was close to concluding its second season and had crested, in a little more than a year, into a full-blown cultural phenomenon. We drove in a big, looping circle around L.A., visiting spots from Hamm\u0027s life B.D., Before Don: the beat-down Silver Lake house where he had consistently charmed the landlady into waiting a few extra days for the rent, the Eastside \u0022below-the-line\u0022 bars where he would drink with grips and best boys and his old Missouri pal Paul Rudd as they waited for something to break. Those lean days were near enough removed then that you could still almost feel the chill of cautious anxiety coming off Hamm\u0027s skin. Our talk was peppered with ifs and God willings. He had only recently splurged on his first serious car, asking his amused financial adviser for permission first. (I got the car wrong in the piece, which annoyed Hamm. It was a 2009 Audi S5.)\u000A\u000ASix and a half years later, we cruise down La Brea in a pantherine Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG—one of the perks of being the voice-over man for the car company\u0027s TV commercials. At Hamm\u0027s suggestion, we\u0027ve ditched lunch at a nice Beverly Hills restaurant to check out a sandwich shop called Top Round. He\u0027s been told that they serve a St. Louis-style thin-shaved roast-beef sandwich. I get the feeling, by this point, that he also just likes to drive. Ever a bro of his generation, Hamm, now 44, cannot help but quote Ferris Bueller as he eases into gear: \u0022It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.\u0022 I make sure to snap a photo of the car\u0027s back end, to get it right this time, though in truth he\u0027s already driven this one for over a year, so it\u0027s time for a new model, anyway. It has 7,300 miles on it.\u000A\u000ABack in 2008, Hamm in his civilian drag of jeans and a baseball hat passed almost unnoticed. These days, things are different. Not only, obviously, do more people know Don Draper; we\u0027ve also all grown accustomed to Jon Hamm himself. Throughout his rise to fame, he\u0027s remained notably present—not in your face, screaming for attention, but...around, game for whatever oddball opportunity has come along.\u000A\u000AThus, the Saturday Night Live appearances, the scene-stealing roles on 30 Rock and in Bridesmaids, a raft of the kind of cameos that get listed in the IMDb alongside the words voice and uncredited in parentheses. When we met, he was in the midst of shooting a role in Netflix\u0027s reboot of Wet Hot American Summer. It is the résumé of an actor who picks up the phone and says, \u0022Yes, what the hell,\u0022 and then drives on over. It\u0027s all seemed very comfortable and fun, which is to say possessed of nearly as opposite a brand of charisma as it\u0027s possible to get from Don Draper\u0027s. Jon Hamm, in the good way, is not really very cool.\u000A\u000AInstead, he\u0027s an enthusiast, what his longtime girlfriend, the actress and filmmaker Jennifer Westfeldt, calls \u0022a goofball and a science nerd and a voracious reader and a fanatical Cardinals fan and a comedy geek.\u0022 That last, in particular, rings true. Long before stardom, he was a familiar presence on the periphery of L.A.\u0027s underground comedy scene—a regular at venues like M Bar and Largo. He played in a poker game with guys like Michael Ian Black, David Wain, and Comedy Bang! Bang! host Scott Aukerman. \u0022He was just this goofy dude with a funny sense of humor who kept being on these failed TV shows,\u0022 says Aukerman. \u0022The surprise to me was how good of a dramatic actor he was. The guy I recognize personally is the Jon Hamm of Bridesmaids and SNL. The guy I don\u0027t recognize is Don Draper.\u0022\u000A\u000AAukerman\u0027s podcast is one of many on which Hamm has appeared over the years, more than holding his own among the more practiced funnymen and -women. In high school, he was the linebacker who also starred in the drama club\u0027s production of Godspell; listening to his podcast appearances, you get a clear sense of his ease in both worlds. And listening to his hosts, you can hear echoes of the giddy thrill nerds feel when the cool kid suddenly sits at their lunch table.\u000A\u000A\u0022I was just kind of that weird kid that always hung around\u0022 is how Hamm prefers to see it. \u0022And you know, comedians are generally pretty nice people.\u0022 From a comic\u0027s point of view, he\u0027s an ideal member of the scene: an appreciative audience member, fun to hang with, but with no personal designs on getting onstage himself. He is perhaps falsely modest on this point, but emphatic: \u0022I have no affinity for it other than my appreciation of it. I had no desire to get up onstage and tell jokes. I prefer to stand next to really funny people. I was always good at being observationally funny—like contributing something funny to the conversation.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022He\u0027s really good at doing bits,\u0022 says Seth Meyers, describing the ability, much prized by comedians, to seamlessly riff offstage (or, as Meyers explains it, not having to constantly ask, \u0022Wait, are you being serious right now?\u0022). Meyers was SNL\u0027s head writer when Hamm first appeared on the show and didn\u0027t know what to expect from his guest host. \u0022As soon as you start talking to Jon, you realize he speaks in the terminology of comedy,\u0022 he says. And he\u0027s got good instincts: For \u0022Jon Hamm\u0027s John Ham,\u0022 which Meyers calls \u0022one of the dumbest sketches I ever wrote\u0022 (it was an ad for deli meat to be eaten on the toilet), the actor grasped immediately that it would only work delivered absolutely straight. \u0022He has an ability to give it a Leslie Nielsen-type quality. He can play something with no awareness when that\u0027s what\u0027s required,\u0022 Meyers says.\u000A\u000AComedy has also proved an elegant solution to the problem faced by any actor who spends a long time playing an iconic role. It\u0027s not fair, but it\u0027s true: Jon and Don look an awful lot alike. When you watch Hamm deliver a sports agent\u0027s pitch in the baseball movie Million Dollar Arm or suffer beneath a sheen of sweat as a morphine-addicted doctor on the British TV series A Young Doctor\u0027s Notebook, it\u0027s hard to shake Don Draper. But he is never less like the adman than when he is playing the comic.\u000A\u000AHamm shrugs. \u0022Mostly it\u0027s been like \u0027Who doesn\u0027t like to laugh?\u0027 \u0022 he says. \u0022Being goofy, being funny, fucking around—that\u0027s part of what makes life worth going through.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo maybe the future is clear: funny, varied, surprising. And right now, the only thing standing between Hamm and the future is The Past.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A2. MAD MAN\u000A\u000AThe end of the \u002760s has always been as potent a myth as the \u002760s themselves. It\u0027s why Altamont is as vivid in the imagination as Woodstock, Manson as Martin Luther King Jr.; it\u0027s why the Grateful Dead songbook is suffused with death. Mad Men has never trucked in such specifics; one of the show\u0027s most consistently illuminating insights has been the way the big events of history play out on the edges of people\u0027s real lives. But Matthew Weiner\u0027s creation has presented the same M&amp;#xF6;bius strip of mystique and demystification, glamour and disintegration. It has been at once an infatuated elegy for an era and a great Oedipal fuck-you to it. And the end has been there literally from the beginning, ever since Don began his long, tumbling fall.\u000A\u000APretty soon, that fall is going to end. Perhaps that hasn\u0027t sunk in. Perhaps Mad Men already feels like a relic from a bygone era; after all, it is on cable, which for you youngsters was a short-lived content-delivery system that preceded Internet streaming. Like The Sopranos—its progenitor in so many ways—the show has lived long enough to have wandered in a few questionable narrative circles, to be overtaken in the public chatter by younger, fresher series, ultimately to be taken a little for granted. But somewhere around the middle of January, in between the new season premiere of Girls and the Super Bowl, you could feel the first anxious flutterings as the Internet began to look ahead for the next big consensus Moment and began its passionate re-embrace of Mad Men. Months before the premiere of this last set of episodes, Vulture was first out of the gate with a post, \u0022Can You Like Mad Men If You Think Don Draper Is a Bad Dude?\u0022 Finales like Mad Men\u0027s have become those rarest of events, at least outside of sports and award shows, that demand everyone watch at the same time. (Whatever else streaming has brought to the Golden Age of TV, those group experiences are something it sacrifices at the altar of on-demand.) Pretty soon it\u0027s going to hit home that we have only a few more hours to spend in the company of Peggy and Pete, Roger and Joan. And Don, of course, as much a man out of time as ever: TV\u0027s Last Difficult Man.\u000A\u000AWalter White is gone, dead amidst his beloved lab equipment. Tony Soprano is...let\u0027s just say gone. So is Deadwood\u0027s Al Swearengen and The Wire\u0027s Jimmy McNulty and The Shield\u0027s Vic Mackey—all those raging, broken, lovable, despicable men who formed the sharp edge of the plow pushing television out of its boob-tube past and into the Golden Age. That battle has been won, more quickly and definitively than even the men and women who orchestrated it could have imagined. The idea that art can flourish on TV is now a given. We no longer need the Trojan horse of genre—Mob show, cop show, period piece, Western—to sneak quality onto the small screen, and we no longer need the glib formulation of the antihero to keep it there. A TV series can exist just to tell stories now—all kinds of stories, from all kinds of perspectives. Some, sure, are likely to include male characters who are both charismatic and deeply flawed, who are endlessly contradictory and essentially unknowable—even, or especially, to themselves. But in that way, \u0022antiheroic\u0022 was always just a way of saying \u0022real.\u0022\u000A\u000AMad Men has long trafficked in emotional violence at least as disturbing as the mayhem of its more overtly bloody counterparts. And though the stakes were, on paper, much lower, it somehow always seemed more of a given that Don Draper would end up dead than either Tony or Walt. (\u0022I certainly can\u0027t confirm or deny anything,\u0022 says Hamm, of course.)\u000A\u000AJohn Slattery, who plays Roger Sterling on the show, received his script for the final episode before shooting began, and read excitedly to the end. What he found there was strangely underwhelming. \u0022I thought, \u0027Wait, what?\u0027 It wasn\u0027t as...eventful as you would expect.\u0022 That was the feeling at the episode\u0027s table read, attended by the entire cast and plenty of curious crew. Then, after a pause, Matthew Weiner called out a list of core cast members, most of whom had been on the show since the beginning, and asked them to follow him to his office. There he revealed the real ending. It was a level of caution that was probably warranted, considering that, thanks to AMC\u0027s decision to split the final season into two parts, the secret would have to be kept for well over a year.\u000A\u000AHamm, by that point, had already kept it far longer. Before each season, around the time that Weiner began to reconvene his writers\u0027 room, he and Hamm would meet for a discussion of the upcoming season. Often the meetings would take place at the Pacific Dining Car, near Downtown L.A., an almost-century-old twenty-four-hour diner populated at odd hours by politicians, lawyers, and judges from the nearby court buildings, as well as showrunners and their stars fitting one another into busy schedules.\u000A\u000ADespite Weiner\u0027s well-earned reputation as a dazzling monologuist, these were apparently conversations. \u0022We would sit down and talk about where we left off and how old is Don now. What is it to be 36 and in a position of incredible power and to have the rug pulled out from under you in your relationship? What is it about starting a new job—the bluster and confidence that takes? What is it about turning 40? Losing touch with your kids? Being in a relationship with a younger woman? What\u0027s that all about?\u0022 Hamm says.\u000A\u000AUltimately, that\u0027s always been Mad Men\u0027s ambition: to portray, sometimes ruthlessly, what real life is like—in all its messiness, frustration, and lack of clear progress. It was a reverse origin story, setting up Don as superhero and immediately beginning a project of dismantlement, chipping away until it occurred to horrified viewers that perhaps Superman was Clark Kent and nothing more all along: just another Everyman with vomit on his shirt.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s been harder for many of us to accept than it has been for Hamm, who always brought a special depth of understanding to who Don is. He continues to be clearer-eyed than most at answering Vulture\u0027s question: Of course Don is a bad dude. \u0022I\u0027m the guy who lives with the guy every day, and I\u0027m like, \u0027No, no, no, no, no,\u0027 \u0022 he says of people who would excuse the character\u0027s behavior. \u0022But I also get the thing in popular culture, American culture, where you see a broken thing and go, \u0027I want to fix that. I want to shape that. I want to cure that.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AIn any event, it may have been at one of those Pacific Dining Car meetings, Hamm doesn\u0027t remember exactly, that Weiner first gave him an intimation of how the show would end. This was around season three, when Weiner was embroiled in a dispute with AMC and there was no guarantee that the end wasn\u0027t actually pretty nigh.\u000A\u000A\u0022He just kind of had this idea. This image,\u0022 Hamm remembers. It must feel very long ago, now that the image has become real, Don Draper\u0027s end committed forever to film and locked away somewhere. \u0022I said, \u0027That\u0027s very poetic. All right. But now we\u0027ve got to get there.\u0027 It\u0027s one thing to say we\u0027re going to end in Topeka, but how are we going to get to Topeka?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A3. FREE MAN\u000A\u000A\u0022Hey, fucko\u0022\u000A\u000AIt was a few years ago, and Hamm and Westfeldt were on their way out of Orso, a restaurant in New York. Hamm looked up, into the grinning face of James Gandolfini, who was just stepping out of a chauffeured car, arriving for dinner. \u0022I\u0027m like, \u0027Oh, Jesus.\u0027 He was just the nicest guy, always very sweet and friendly. But the first thing you think is you\u0027re going to be murdered.\u0022 Gandolfini offered to have his driver take them home—a tip of the hat from a Difficult Man Emeritus, now out of the game, to a younger member still in the thick of it.\u000A\u000ASometime later, in Boston, Hamm ran into Bryan Cranston, himself only recently freed from the yoke of Breaking Bad. \u0022It\u0027s hard, man,\u0022 Cranston told him. \u0022It\u0027s hard to let it go. It\u0027ll hit you a couple of different ways at different times.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo far, it seems to mostly be disorienting. Shooting for the second half of season seven ended way back last summer. \u0022The whole last season was like senior year in high school,\u0022 Hamm says. \u0022 \u0027We\u0027ll stay in touch!\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll text you!\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll see each other all the time!\u0027 And it\u0027s like, \u0027Will we really?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s been a dawning realization that this summer vacation won\u0027t be coming to an end, that he\u0027ll never go through the transformation into Don again, never slip into that smooth, seductive wardrobe. \u0022You button up into one of those suits and it\u0027s like, \u0027Okay, there\u0027s a certain way that I feel. I feel confident. I feel put together. I feel great-looking.\u0027 You get the whole gear going and you\u0027re like, \u0027All right.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AThat, of course, underplays both the virtuosity of the performance and its burden—something that Gandolfini and Cranston could have warned him about. \u0022Whenever people want to talk about how hard it is to be an actor, I want to go, \u0027Um, it\u0027s hard to be a baby-heart surgeon.\u0027 Being an actor is actually pretty easy, if you can memorize lines,\u0022 he says. Still, he admits that it\u0027s been draining to follow Don on his repeated downward spirals. \u0022You\u0027re kind of hoping for redemption, and it\u0027s not forthcoming.... To consistently come in and be the bummer was always like, \u0027Oh, that\u0027s not fun.\u0027 But at the same time, it\u0027s been like the greatest obstacle course in the world. A puzzle to figure out.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s a confusing juxtaposition,\u0022 Westfeldt says. \u0022I think the darkness of Don has weighed heavily on Jon, despite it being the role of a lifetime and the opportunity that gave him the career of his dreams. The end was of course bittersweet and complicated for Jonny. But I know that when he wrapped the show in L.A., in the wee hours of July 3 last year, and then immediately got on a plane to New York to meet me and our dog, Cora, for dinner with a few close friends and to watch the fireworks, he felt a predominant sense of relief. He remarked on the cosmic coincidence of the date: Independence Day. Finally.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Look, the one constant thing I\u0027ve had in my career is now removed,\u0022 says Hamm. \u0022And that\u0027s an eye-opener: Are people still going to take me seriously? Am I just going to do romantic comedies for the rest of my life? What\u0027s next? And I don\u0027t know, you know? I wish I was smug enough to have had a grand plan. I guess some people would say, \u0027Okay, the last three years of Mad Men is going to be like this: I want to do a play. I want to do this. I want to do that.\u0027 I was just like, \u0027I want to do something that seems cool.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s meant strikingly few movies—fewer still of the variety you might have expected at the outset. He turned down the inevitable flood of smoldering-period-piece offers that followed Mad Men\u0027s success, but also subsequent chances to take on the kind of superhero roles for which his jawline might have been generated in a 3-D printer. A franchise like that is just too much of a long-term commitment. He\u0027s happy that with the exception of a stint in India filming Million Dollar Arm, most of his work has been done close to his homes in L.A. and on New York\u0027s Upper West Side. He likes being near Cora. It takes a certain kind of homebody to hear the final moment of the most important character he may ever play and think \u0022Topeka.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Change is neither good or bad,\u0022 Don Draper once said. \u0022It just is.\u0022 The end was there from the beginning. It\u0027s all about to end all over again. Jon Hamm is ready.\u000A\u000ABRETT MARTIN (@brettmartin) is a GQ correspondent and the author of Difficult Men: Behind the Scenes of a Creative Revolution",

We drove in a big, looping circle around L.A., visiting spots from Hamm&#x2019;s life B.D., Before Don: the beat-down Silver Lake house where he had consistently charmed the landlady into waiting a few extra days for the rent, the Eastside &quot;below-the-line&quot; bars where he would drink with grips and best boys and his old Missouri pal Paul Rudd as they waited for something to break. Those lean days were near enough removed then that you could still almost feel the chill of cautious anxiety coming off Hamm&#x2019;s skin. Our talk was peppered with <em>if</em>s and <em>God willing</em>s. He had only recently splurged on his first serious car, asking his amused financial adviser for permission first. (I got the car wrong in the piece, which annoyed Hamm. It was a 2009 Audi S5.)</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.6">Six and a half years later, we cruise down La Brea in a pantherine Mercedes-Benz CLS63 AMG&#x2014;one of the perks of being the voice-over man for the car company&#x2019;s TV commercials. At Hamm&#x2019;s suggestion, we&#x2019;ve ditched lunch at a nice Beverly Hills restaurant to check out a sandwich shop called Top Round. He&#x2019;s been told that they serve a St. Louis-style thin-shaved roast-beef sandwich. I get the feeling, by this point, that he also just likes to drive. Ever a bro of his generation, Hamm, now 44, cannot help but quote Ferris Bueller as he eases into gear: &quot;It is <em>so</em> choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.&quot; I make sure to snap a photo of the car&#x2019;s back end, to get it right this time, though in truth he&#x2019;s already driven this one for over a year, so it&#x2019;s time for a new model, anyway. It has 7,300 miles on it.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.7">Back in 2008, Hamm in his civilian drag of jeans and a baseball hat passed almost unnoticed. These days, things are different. Not only, obviously, do more people know Don Draper; we&#x2019;ve also all grown accustomed to Jon Hamm himself. Throughout his rise to fame, he&#x2019;s remained notably present&#x2014;not in your face, screaming for attention, but...<em>around,</em> game for whatever oddball opportunity has come along.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.8">Thus, the <em>Saturday Night Live</em> appearances, the scene-stealing roles on <em>30 Rock</em> and in <em>Bridesmaids,</em> a raft of the kind of cameos that get listed in the IMDb alongside the words <em>voice</em> and <em>uncredited</em> in parentheses. When we met, he was in the midst of shooting a role in Netflix&#x2019;s reboot of <em>Wet Hot American Summer.</em> It is the r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; of an actor who picks up the phone and says, &quot;Yes, what the hell,&quot; and then drives on over. It&#x2019;s all seemed very comfortable and fun, which is to say possessed of nearly as opposite a brand of charisma as it&#x2019;s possible to get from Don Draper&#x2019;s. Jon Hamm, in the good way, is not really very <em>cool.</em></p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.9">Instead, he&#x2019;s an enthusiast, what his longtime girlfriend, the actress and filmmaker Jennifer Westfeldt, calls &quot;a goofball and a science nerd and a voracious reader and a fanatical Cardinals fan and a comedy geek.&quot; That last, in particular, rings true. Long before stardom, he was a familiar presence on the periphery of L.A.&#x2019;s underground comedy scene&#x2014;a regular at venues like M Bar and Largo. He played in a poker game with guys like Michael Ian Black, David Wain, and <em>Comedy Bang! Bang!</em> host Scott Aukerman. &quot;He was just this goofy dude with a funny sense of humor who kept being on these failed TV shows,&quot; says Aukerman. &quot;The surprise to me was how good of a dramatic actor he was. The guy I recognize personally is the Jon Hamm of <em>Bridesmaids</em> and <em>SNL.</em> The guy I don&#x2019;t recognize is Don Draper.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.a">Aukerman&#x2019;s podcast is one of many on which Hamm has appeared over the years, more than holding his own among the more practiced funnymen and -women. In high school, he was the linebacker who also starred in the drama club&#x2019;s production of <em>Godspell;</em> listening to his podcast appearances, you get a clear sense of his ease in both worlds. And listening to his hosts, you can hear echoes of the giddy thrill nerds feel when the cool kid suddenly sits at their lunch table.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.b">&quot;I was just kind of that weird kid that always hung around&quot; is how Hamm prefers to see it. &quot;And you know, comedians are generally pretty nice people.&quot; From a comic&#x2019;s point of view, he&#x2019;s an ideal member of the scene: an appreciative audience member, fun to hang with, but with no personal designs on getting onstage himself. He is perhaps falsely modest on this point, but emphatic: &quot;I have no affinity for it other than my appreciation of it. I had no desire to get up onstage and tell jokes. I prefer to stand <em>next</em> to really funny people. I was always good at being observationally funny&#x2014;like contributing something funny to the conversation.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.c">&quot;He&#x2019;s really good at doing bits,&quot; says Seth Meyers, describing the ability, much prized by comedians, to seamlessly riff offstage (or, as Meyers explains it, not having to constantly ask, &quot;Wait, are you being serious right now?&quot;). Meyers was <em>SNL&#x2019;</em>s head writer when Hamm first appeared on the show and didn&#x2019;t know what to expect from his guest host. &quot;As soon as you start talking to Jon, you realize he speaks in the terminology of comedy,&quot; he says. And he&#x2019;s got good instincts: For &quot;Jon Hamm&#x2019;s John Ham,&quot; which Meyers calls &quot;one of the dumbest sketches I ever wrote&quot; (it was an ad for deli meat to be eaten on the toilet), the actor grasped immediately that it would only work delivered absolutely straight. &quot;He has an ability to give it a Leslie Nielsen-type quality. He can play something with no awareness when that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s required,&quot; Meyers says.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.d">Comedy has also proved an elegant solution to the problem faced by any actor who spends a long time playing an iconic role. It&#x2019;s not fair, but it&#x2019;s true: Jon and Don look an awful lot alike. When you watch Hamm deliver a sports agent&#x2019;s pitch in the baseball movie <em>Million Dollar Arm</em> or suffer beneath a sheen of sweat as a morphine-addicted doctor on the British TV series <em>A Young Doctor&#x2019;s Notebook,</em> it&#x2019;s hard to shake Don Draper. But he is never less like the adman than when he is playing the comic.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.e">Hamm shrugs. &quot;Mostly it&#x2019;s been like &#x2019;Who doesn&#x2019;t like to laugh?&#x2019; &quot; he says. &quot;Being goofy, being funny, fucking around&#x2014;that&#x2019;s part of what makes life worth going through.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.f">So maybe the future is clear: funny, varied, surprising. And right now, the only thing standing between Hamm and the future is The Past.</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.g"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="http://player.cnevids.com/embed/550b195461646d4868000000/51097beb8ef9aff9f5000005" height="390" width="560"></iframe></div></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.h"><hr></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.i"><h2><strong>2. </strong>MAD MAN</h2></div><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.j">The end of the &#x2019;60s has always been as potent a myth as the &#x2019;60s themselves. It&#x2019;s why Altamont is as vivid in the imagination as Woodstock, Manson as Martin Luther King Jr.; it&#x2019;s why the Grateful Dead songbook is suffused with death. <em>Mad Men</em> has never trucked in such specifics; one of the show&#x2019;s most consistently illuminating insights has been the way the big events of history play out on the edges of people&#x2019;s real lives. But Matthew Weiner&#x2019;s creation has presented the same M&amp;#xF6;bius strip of mystique and demystification, glamour and disintegration. It has been at once an infatuated elegy for an era and a great Oedipal fuck-you to it. And the end has been there literally from the beginning, ever since Don began his long, tumbling fall.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.k">Pretty soon, that fall is going to end. Perhaps that hasn&#x2019;t sunk in. Perhaps <em>Mad Men</em> already feels like a relic from a bygone era; after all, it is on <em>cable,</em> which for you youngsters was a short-lived content-delivery system that preceded Internet streaming. Like <em>The Sopranos</em>&#x2014;its progenitor in so many ways&#x2014;the show has lived long enough to have wandered in a few questionable narrative circles, to be overtaken in the public chatter by younger, fresher series, ultimately to be taken a little for granted. But somewhere around the middle of January, in between the new season premiere of <em>Girls</em> and the Super Bowl, you could feel the first anxious flutterings as the Internet began to look ahead for the next big consensus Moment and began its passionate re-embrace of <em>Mad Men</em>. Months before the premiere of this last set of episodes, Vulture was first out of the gate with <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2015/01/stay-tuned-don-draper-bad-person.html">a post</a>, &quot;Can You Like <em>Mad Men</em> If You Think Don Draper Is a Bad Dude?&quot; Finales like <em>Mad Men&#x2019;</em>s have become those rarest of events, at least outside of sports and award shows, that demand everyone watch at the same time. (Whatever else streaming has brought to the Golden Age of TV, those group experiences are something it sacrifices at the altar of on-demand.) Pretty soon it&#x2019;s going to hit home that we have only a few more hours to spend in the company of Peggy and Pete, Roger and Joan. And Don, of course, as much a man out of time as ever: TV&#x2019;s Last Difficult Man.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.l">Walter White is gone, dead amidst his beloved lab equipment. Tony Soprano is...let&#x2019;s just say gone. So is <em>Deadwood&#x2019;</em>s Al Swearengen and <em>The Wire&#x2019;</em>s Jimmy McNulty and <em>The Shield&#x2019;</em>s Vic Mackey&#x2014;all those raging, broken, lovable, despicable men who formed the sharp edge of the plow pushing television out of its boob-tube past and into the Golden Age. That battle has been won, more quickly and definitively than even the men and women who orchestrated it could have imagined. The idea that art can flourish on TV is now a given. We no longer need the Trojan horse of genre&#x2014;Mob show, cop show, period piece, Western&#x2014;to sneak quality onto the small screen, and we no longer need the glib formulation of the antihero to keep it there. A TV series can exist just to tell stories now&#x2014;all kinds of stories, from all kinds of perspectives. Some, sure, are likely to include male characters who are both charismatic and deeply flawed, who are endlessly contradictory and essentially unknowable&#x2014;even, or especially, to themselves. But in that way, &quot;antiheroic&quot; was always just a way of saying &quot;real.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.m"><em>Mad Men</em> has long trafficked in emotional violence at least as disturbing as the mayhem of its more overtly bloody counterparts. And though the stakes were, on paper, much lower, it somehow always seemed more of a given that Don Draper would end up dead than either Tony or Walt. (&quot;I certainly can&#x2019;t confirm or deny anything,&quot; says Hamm, of course.)</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.n">John Slattery, who plays Roger Sterling on the show, received his script for the final episode before shooting began, and read excitedly to the end. What he found there was strangely underwhelming. &quot;I thought, &#x2019;Wait, <em>what?</em>&#x2019; It wasn&#x2019;t as...eventful as you would expect.&quot; That was the feeling at the episode&#x2019;s table read, attended by the entire cast and plenty of curious crew. Then, after a pause, Matthew Weiner called out a list of core cast members, most of whom had been on the show since the beginning, and asked them to follow him to his office. There he revealed the real ending. It was a level of caution that was probably warranted, considering that, thanks to AMC&#x2019;s decision to split the final season into two parts, the secret would have to be kept for well over a year.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.o">Hamm, by that point, had already kept it far longer. Before each season, around the time that Weiner began to reconvene his writers&#x2019; room, he and Hamm would meet for a discussion of the upcoming season. Often the meetings would take place at the Pacific Dining Car, near Downtown L.A., an almost-century-old twenty-four-hour diner populated at odd hours by politicians, lawyers, and judges from the nearby court buildings, as well as showrunners and their stars fitting one another into busy schedules.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.p">Despite Weiner&#x2019;s well-earned reputation as a dazzling monologuist, these were apparently conversations. &quot;We would sit down and talk about where we left off and how old is Don now. What is it to be 36 and in a position of incredible power and to have the rug pulled out from under you in your relationship? What is it about starting a new job&#x2014;the bluster and confidence that takes? What is it about turning 40? Losing touch with your kids? Being in a relationship with a younger woman? What&#x2019;s that all about?&quot; Hamm says.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.q">Ultimately, that&#x2019;s always been <em>Mad Men&#x2019;</em>s ambition: to portray, sometimes ruthlessly, what real life is like&#x2014;in all its messiness, frustration, and lack of clear progress. It was a reverse origin story, setting up Don as superhero and immediately beginning a project of dismantlement, chipping away until it occurred to horrified viewers that perhaps Superman was Clark Kent and nothing more all along: just another Everyman with vomit on his shirt.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.r">That&#x2019;s been harder for many of us to accept than it has been for Hamm, who always brought a special depth of understanding to who Don is. He continues to be clearer-eyed than most at answering Vulture&#x2019;s question: Of <em>course</em> Don is a bad dude. &quot;I&#x2019;m the guy who lives with the guy every day, and I&#x2019;m like, &#x2019;No, no, no, no, no,&#x2019; &quot; he says of people who would excuse the character&#x2019;s behavior. &quot;But I also get the thing in popular culture, American culture, where you see a broken thing and go, &#x2019;I want to fix that. I want to shape that. I want to cure that.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.s">In any event, it may have been at one of those Pacific Dining Car meetings, Hamm doesn&#x2019;t remember exactly, that Weiner first gave him an intimation of how the show would end. This was around season three, when Weiner was embroiled in a dispute with AMC and there was no guarantee that the end wasn&#x2019;t actually pretty nigh.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.t">&quot;He just kind of had this idea. This image,&quot; Hamm remembers. It must feel very long ago, now that the image has become real, Don Draper&#x2019;s end committed forever to film and locked away somewhere. &quot;I said, &#x2019;That&#x2019;s very poetic. All right. But now we&#x2019;ve got to get there.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s one thing to say we&#x2019;re going to end in Topeka, but <em>how are we going to get to Topeka?</em>&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.u"><hr></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.v"><h2><strong>3. </strong>FREE MAN</h2></div><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.w">&quot;Hey, fucko&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.x">It was a few years ago, and Hamm and Westfeldt were on their way out of Orso, a restaurant in New York. Hamm looked up, into the grinning face of James Gandolfini, who was just stepping out of a chauffeured car, arriving for dinner. &quot;I&#x2019;m like, &#x2019;Oh, Jesus.&#x2019; He was just the nicest guy, always very sweet and friendly. But the first thing you think is you&#x2019;re going to be murdered.&quot; Gandolfini offered to have his driver take them home&#x2014;a tip of the hat from a Difficult Man Emeritus, now out of the game, to a younger member still in the thick of it.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.y">Sometime later, in Boston, Hamm ran into Bryan Cranston, himself only recently freed from the yoke of <em>Breaking Bad</em>. &quot;It&#x2019;s hard, man,&quot; Cranston told him. &quot;It&#x2019;s hard to let it go. It&#x2019;ll hit you a couple of different ways at different times.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.z">So far, it seems to mostly be disorienting. Shooting for the second half of season seven ended way back last summer. &quot;The whole last season was like senior year in high school,&quot; Hamm says. &quot; &#x2019;We&#x2019;ll stay in touch!&#x2019; &#x2019;I&#x2019;ll text you!&#x2019; &#x2019;We&#x2019;ll see each other all the time!&#x2019; And it&#x2019;s like, &#x2019;Will we <em>really?</em>&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.10">There&#x2019;s been a dawning realization that this summer vacation won&#x2019;t be coming to an end, that he&#x2019;ll never go through the transformation into Don again, never slip into that smooth, seductive wardrobe. &quot;You button up into one of those suits and it&#x2019;s like, &#x2019;Okay, there&#x2019;s a certain way that I feel. I feel confident. I feel put together. I feel <em>great-looking.</em>&#x2019; You get the whole gear going and you&#x2019;re like, &#x2019;All right.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.11">That, of course, underplays both the virtuosity of the performance and its burden&#x2014;something that Gandolfini and Cranston could have warned him about. &quot;Whenever people want to talk about how hard it is to be an actor, I want to go, &#x2019;Um, it&#x2019;s hard to be a <em>baby-heart surgeon.</em>&#x2019; Being an actor is actually pretty easy, if you can memorize lines,&quot; he says. Still, he admits that it&#x2019;s been draining to follow Don on his repeated downward spirals. &quot;You&#x2019;re kind of hoping for redemption, and it&#x2019;s not forthcoming.... To consistently come in and be the bummer was always like, &#x2019;Oh, that&#x2019;s not fun.&#x2019; But at the same time, it&#x2019;s been like the greatest obstacle course in the world. A puzzle to figure out.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.12">&quot;It&#x2019;s a confusing juxtaposition,&quot; Westfeldt says. &quot;I think the darkness of Don has weighed heavily on Jon, despite it being the role of a lifetime and the opportunity that gave him the career of his dreams. The end was of course bittersweet and complicated for Jonny. But I know that when he wrapped the show in L.A., in the wee hours of July 3 last year, and then immediately got on a plane to New York to meet me and our dog, Cora, for dinner with a few close friends and to watch the fireworks, he felt a predominant sense of relief. He remarked on the cosmic coincidence of the date: Independence Day. Finally.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.13">&quot;Look, the one constant thing I&#x2019;ve had in my career is now removed,&quot; says Hamm. &quot;And that&#x2019;s an eye-opener: Are people still going to take me seriously? Am I just going to do romantic comedies for the rest of my life? What&#x2019;s next? And I don&#x2019;t know, you know? I wish I was smug enough to have had a grand plan. I guess some people would say, &#x2019;Okay, the last three years of <em>Mad Men</em> is going to be like this: I want to do a play. I want to do this. I want to do that.&#x2019; I was just like, &#x2019;I want to do something that seems cool.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.14">That&#x2019;s meant strikingly few movies&#x2014;fewer still of the variety you might have expected at the outset. He turned down the inevitable flood of smoldering-period-piece offers that followed <em>Mad Men&#x2019;</em>s success, but also subsequent chances to take on the kind of superhero roles for which his jawline might have been generated in a 3-D printer. A franchise like that is just too much of a long-term commitment. He&#x2019;s happy that with the exception of a stint in India filming <em>Million Dollar Arm,</em> most of his work has been done close to his homes in L.A. and on New York&#x2019;s Upper West Side. He likes being near Cora. It takes a certain kind of homebody to hear the final moment of the most important character he may ever play and think &quot;Topeka.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.15">&quot;Change is neither good or bad,&quot; Don Draper once said. &quot;It just is.&quot; The end was there from the beginning. It&#x2019;s all about to end all over again. Jon Hamm is ready.</p><p data-reactid=".12b5nhr3fgg.1.1.0.0.4.16"><a href="http://www.gq.com/contributors/brett-martin"><strong>BRETT MARTIN</strong></a><em> (<a
