  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHe paces alone, hands in pocket, by the small schoolboy desk. Apart from the fine wooden lecterns, the Senate chamber is drab—dull lighting, light paint. The walls are studded with busts of forgotten men, the first twenty vice presidents of the United States. Today, Senator John McCain has come over from his office to once again make a pitch for an amendment no one seems to want.\u000A\u000AHe waits for his turn to speak, pacing. The dark gray suit frames a blue shirt with the requisite television-red tie. The skin is pale beyond what the word white can convey, save for the red slashes on the left side of his face, one before the jaw, one behind the ear, where surgeons have gouged out yet more melanoma. He wears sunblock for even a brief press conference outside. The morning has been a pile of newspapers, a series of one-minute meetings with staff, a bacon-and-lettuce sandwich wolfed down with a cup of coffee and then the fast walk with staff trailing, a descent in the private Senate elevator, a short ride on the Senate subway, up another elevator and down the ornate hallways, all the while talking with staff and tossing out quips. And then at 1 P.M., into the tomb of the Senate itself, the still air, the lack of sunlight, the funereal calm of an old clubhouse.\u000A\u000AMore than a dozen senators are on the floor, talking about corporate responsibility. The cloakroom just off the chamber is stuffed with more of this bizarre and tiny tribe. The various senators idly visit with one another, chatting amiably. But no one sidles up to McCain. Not even his so-called friends: Six years ago, McCain chaired the presidential run of Phil Gramm of Texas. Today Gramm patently ignores him.\u000A\u000ANone of McCain\u0027s colleagues want what he has to offer today, a motion that forces corporations to count stock options against revenue. Since 1994, when Congress approved the practice of keeping these ecutive perks off the books, it has become a form of corporate pillage, with the costs hidden from investors. But McCain finds no support for his measure from fellow Republicans or from many of the Democrats he is whispered to be courting. (In fact, Democratic leader Tom Daschle reportedly quashed an earlier version of the amendment after getting a phone call from venture capitalist John Doerr, a man who has given the Democrats $619,000 since 1999.)\u000A\u000ASo as the other senators harangue about corporate responsibility, about how an independent watchdog entity will fix this and fix that, how it\u0027s high time to deal with security fraud, McCain eagerly awaits his turn. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat with whom he is cosponsoring the amendment, lends McCain a tiny slice of his time.\u000A\u000AMcCain has only enough time to say \u0022The fix is in,\u0022 meaning he knows his colleagues will bow to corporate pressure and ignore his amendment.\u000A\u000AHis brief moment over, he paces some more, hoping for another shot at speaking. But he doesn\u0027t get his chance. In a matter of hours, the corporate-responsibility bill will pass unanimously, without the McCain-Levin amendment, the senators wrapping themselves in a fig leaf of decency and boldly proclaiming that the new law will end the taint of scandals.\u000A\u000AAnd as John McCain continues to pace in the Senate chamber, his real position—what you could call his crucial marginality—is starkly apparent. He is, of course, the man who ignited a bizarre outpouring of support from Democrats and Independents and people who had never bothered to vote before the presidential primaries in 2000. He is the man the successful political insurgents in Bolivia and Colombia and Sri Lanka all claim they based their campaigns on. Now Slovakian reformers are begging him to come to shore up their support. Saturday Night Live asked him to host the show in the fall. He is the great pale hope of voters normally locked in to party politics or dismayed by any politics. He is all these things. And he is a 66-year-old veteran who cannot seem to get even an idle conversation from his colleagues.\u000A\u000AAfter an hour and a half of pacing, he abandons the floor without getting more than his short sentence in and without a single senator voluntarily speaking to him.\u000A\u000AIt is as if he had never been there at all.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AJohn McCain admits that he is resented. He knows he is unloved by \u0022all the right wing.\u0022 He knows that many of his colleagues in the Senate harbor grievances against him. After all, he\u0027s been stalling key federal appointments in committee so he can get the right staff placed on the commission to administer McCain-Feingold, the campaign-finance-reform bill he coauthored.\u000A\u000A\u0022I worked for seven years to get campaign-finance reform,\u0022 he snaps, \u0022and then to see it shredded.\u0022 He admits that in order to get what he wants, he has bruised more than a few people.\u000A\u000ABut when I ask him later about his isolation on the Senate floor, he denies it, says, sure, he and the other senators have differences but he has many friends in the chamber. His staff echoes the chant. And maybe their denials are correct. It is not whether John McCain is ostracized. It is that in the end, no matter how sociable he acts, no matter how many weekends he spends with fellow senators, no matter how many jokes he cracks, he is alone. He was trained to be that way. He is a naval officer in the camouflage of a politician.\u000A\u000A\u0022I think,\u0022 he allows in that accentless voice produced by the endless moving of his father\u0027s military career, \u0022there is a resentment about my blocking the nominations and things like that. I\u0027m sure there is animosity. Some blame my presidential run for Bush\u0027s problems in the campaign. I don\u0027t have a hell of a lot to say to those guys. I\u0027m not a backslapper.\u0022 And then he trails off into that country everyone wonders about, his ambition: \u0022The reason for public service is to do public good. What\u0027s the most powerful place to do it?\u0022 And there is no doubt he does not mean the Senate.\u000A\u000ASome things must never be forgotten about John McCain, even if he has forgotten them at moments in his life. He is always a naval officer, and because of that fact he is always in thrall to his sense of honor, and this sense of honor seems to always suggest that the rest of us are somehow lacking. This is true even when McCain himself does not act in the most honorable way. For example, he has wobbled on the corporate-responsibility front. Eight years ago, when Congress endorsed not counting stock options, nine senators voted against it; he wasn\u0027t one of them. McCain explains that back in 1994, he wasn\u0027t even aware of what he was voting for. But before you have a chance to say this is a feeble explanation, he is quick to add that his ignorance is \u0022no excuse.\u0022 And it\u0027s this sort of frankness—which isn\u0027t really much when you stop and think of it, his simple use of words like \u0022no excuse\u0022—that gives him his power. They are small words that carry some admission of personal responsibility, so rare in American politics. With them, John McCain has been able to build a candor offensive.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHe walks fast, and now the heels of his black loafers click as he moves down the hallway of the Russell Senate Office Building. Staff trail him like cruisers in the wake of a battleship. \u0022Keep moving if you want to love life, and keep your troubles well behind you,\u0022 he writes in his new book, Worth the Fighting For. On this day in July, he\u0027s headed to a hearing of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, where the red meat on the menu is Army Secretary Thomas E. White, formerly of Enron. Before the hearing, McCain says, \u0022I have no sympathy, but I\u0027m not going to be part of a public flogging.\u0022 White, a bristling former brigadier general, reads an opening statement in which he denies any wrongdoing while earning millions at Enron in various electricity plays. \u0022I carried out my responsibilities in an entirely ethical manner,\u0022 he says, \u0022just as I did over the twenty-eight years that I served my country in the army.\u0022 Democratic senator Max Cleland, a triple-amputee Vietnam vet from Georgia, notes firmly that during his service in the army, the officers ate after the men, whereas at Enron the ecutives always ate first, and heavily.\u000A\u000AOn the other side of the panel, McCain sits, ill at ease; he is always a failure at sitting still, and now his pale skin somehow seems to become dark, his jowly face hardens, and he asks how the general could possibly read a statement about his tenure at Enron that mentions no concern for the workers who lost their jobs and every cent of their pension funds.\u000A\u000AWhite sputters out, almost in surprise at such a question, that of course he is \u0022appalled and outraged\u0022 by the apparent financial fraud that took place during his time at Enron and that he regrets what happened to the people who worked there.\u000A\u000AWith that the senator rises and leaves the hearing. In the hallway, he mutters something to me about White\u0027s \u0022arrogance.\u0022 His brisk departure is not a major political event; it is a small moment, soon to be entombed in the printed record of a Senate committee. But it contains everything that seems to baffle other politicians about John McCain. And everything that is bedrock and crystal clear to him. And this bedrock is not liberal and it is not conservative. It is absolute, primitive, unthought, unquestioned and relentless. It is about instinct and about principles drummed into the head during boyhood, and it is what often makes him a lonely and compelling man.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAs McCain strides the corridor to yet another Senate hearing, I throw questions at him.\u000A\u000A\u0022Senator,\u0022 I ask, \u0022a one-word description of your politics: liberal, moderate, conservative or communist?\u0022 He starts to speak, then pauses, then fires up again, then pauses, then says, \u0022T. R.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe adds: \u0022Teddy Roosevelt Republican.\u0022 Then another pause and \u0022But I\u0027m really still a conservative.\u0022 One more pause and \u0022Make that a Teddy Roosevelt Republican.\u0022 McCain has two levels of talk: a boilerplate of sentences for issues, and this other discourse of sentence fragments for things he is responding to in the moment. Then he vanishes into a committee hearing, where he decries \u0022special interests\u0022 and \u0022big-money lobbyists, some of them in this room.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe is striding from his car to his office.\u000A\u000A\u0022Senator,\u0022 I ask, \u0022how can these liberal pundits be floating the idea of you running as a Democrat when you have a conservative record?\u0022 At first he looks a bit irked at the notion, pauses, cocks his head and seems to become a freeze-frame. Then he agrees, explains why his record will never add up to a Democrat: \u0022I\u0027m pro-life, pro—missile defense, pro—privatizing Social Security, pro—school vouchers and an unqualified supporter of free trade.\u0022 And he is a stone-cold soldier in the War on Drugs: \u0022To legalize hard drugs would be a mistake,\u0022 he intones. And then he adds that dollop of candor that always seems to pop out of his senatorial mouth by noting that when his doctors gave him painkillers for surgery, it was \u0022the most euphoric feeling I\u0027ve ever had in my life.\u0022\u000A\u000AOf course, for John McCain life is not about euphoria; it is not even in the end about rights. It is about personal responsibility. He tells me he dislikes being called a maverick because \u0022the appellation means someone who is wild.\u0022 But he lives on political energy that seems untrustworthy to his own party—his campaign-finance-reform legislation was viewed by Republicans as lethal to their major asset, the checkbook.\u000A\u000AI ask him if he worries about being seen as a party traitor, and he answers crisply: \u0022I already am.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe voice is soft, almost shipping the words out in a warm fuzz. The hazel eyes are alert, pilot\u0027s eyes, and the smiles come easily, as if life were one long smoker in an officers\u0027 club. McCain has that ease with being male, the calm been-there-done-that manner. The body movements are somewhat jerky now, the arms held out as if somehow pinned away from the torso, the shoulders stiff and not relad—all this baggage from a bad parachute landing followed by beatings and torture in the Hanoi Hilton when he was a prisoner for five and a half years during the Vietnam War. He can\u0027t lift his arms very high, can\u0027t comb his hair or brush lint off his shoulders.\u000A\u000AHe is being updated by his staff on various bills as he sits in a tilted chair, coat off, pen twirling in one hand: how cable companies will be affected by broadband changes (\u0022I don\u0027t care; they are all liars\u0022); should commercial-airline pilots have guns in the cockpit; what about this new fire-safe-cigarette bill? When they get to the generic-drug bill, he snorts, almost as a recreation, that the pharmaceutical corporations are \u0022greedy bastards.\u0022\u000A\u000AThen it is out to his car—he drives himself, of course; fighter pilots always take the wheel—and off to a radio station to tape his half of his regular point/counterpoint face-off with Ted Kennedy. \u0022The good news is that it is on hundreds of stations,\u0022 he explains. \u0022The bad news is they seem to broadcast it around five in the morning.\u0022 (He also parachutes regularly into the Don Imus show, because \u0022when I\u0027m going against the grain, it is useful.\u0022) McCain stumbles through the script with brief bouts of dry mouth and coughing and then hits some standard safe riffs: Ted Williams is an American hero, the Pledge of Allegiance should retain the phrase under God (\u0022Give me a break,\u0022 he protests), Amtrak is pork barrel, and as for capital punishment, well, some people deserve to die. He rips through these routine partisan shots while framed by the glass window of the sound booth and a bumper sticker on the wall that says invest in america / buy a congressman. As he leaves the station, he thanks each employee individually.\u000A\u000AMcCain can sound all the right notes, but he doesn\u0027t always follow them. A few days earlier, he gave an address denouncing \u0022crony capitalism,\u0022 \u0022sweetheart loans,\u0022 \u0022reckless greed\u0022 and \u0022lobbyists crawling all over Capitol Hill\u0022 and called for sacking the Bush-appointed head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Harvey Pitt.\u000A\u000AThis after he took $31,000 from the busted Global Crossing, the highest in the Senate between 1997 and 2001; $23,900 from on-the-skids WorldCom, third highest in the Senate; $23,250 from the extinct Arthur Andersen, fabled chef of Enron\u0027s cooked books; and $9,500 from Enron itself. The National Review looked at these numbers and called him a hypocrite.\u000A\u000AI bring up one of his been-there-done-that moments from the past, his involvement with Charles Keating, the poster boy of the 1980s savings-and-loan scandal, a financial hole that cost more than the Vietnam War. McCain received $112,000 in contributions from Keating and his associates, vacationed with him on his island in the Bahamas, flew around on his corporate jet and, along with four other senators, confronted federal regulators trying to shut down Keating\u0027s operation. I once coauthored a book on Keating, and so I am a veritable warehouse of niggling details on the case. When the dust settled from the scandal, McCain got off with a slap on the wrist from the Senate Ethics Committee.\u000A\u000ASo, I ask, what came over you to get involved with a highflier like Charlie Keating, a classic wheeler-dealer who had already been flogged once by the SEC?\u000A\u000AHe stumbles about how Keating was an early supporter, a leading business figure in his home state, but then drops this effort. As he remembers those days and speaks of the damage the scandal did to him and his career, the straight-talk express hits.\u000A\u000A\u0022I saw everything I stood for and aspired to,\u0022 he says quietly, the voice even softer than usual, \u0022disappearing before my eyes. Certain standards that were expected of me by my father and grandfather. My father kept my grandfather alive for me; he revered him. I\u0027d betrayed the public trust. I had performed in a manner that created the impression of improper behavior. It is one thing to think you\u0027ve been unjustly prosecuted; it is another thing to think you really shouldn\u0027t have done what you did.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen McCain is cornered, his candor is a weapon of last resort, something lobbed out from the foxhole. The weapon is his press offensive. He is the senator who will tell it to reporters straight, warts and all. Deploying just the right measure of candor, he bombards the press with direct answers and by this act cows them.\u000A\u000AEspecially on Keating. In 1991 I watched him testify at the Los Angeles criminal trial while Charlie Keating glowered at him from the defense table. McCain never made eye contact with his old vacation host at Cat Cay. And he walked woodenly through a crowd of oldsters, ruined by their purchases of Keating\u0027s junk bonds, who lurked outside the courtroom like a demented Greek chorus. I was underwhelmed.\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve just read the galleys of McCain\u0027s new book, in which he states that he last saw Keating in the spring of 1987. When I mention that this 1991 event is missing from the new book, McCain is stunned and quickly makes a note to have it corrected. When I say, \u0022Did you block out the memory? I was there, and you were very uncomfortable,\u0022 he sputters and then allows that, yes, it was not a good day for him. And now, my God, I actually believe him. I believe him, even though he wrote that he \u0022never laid eyes\u0022 on Keating after March 24, 1987. When McCain ran for president in 2000, I\u0027d scan the press and think he was being handled with kid gloves by a bunch of reporters starstruck by his horrific war experience. I kept looking for some real examinations of his involvement with Keating, of his legendary temper explosions, of his war with the Arizona press when they accurately reported his wife\u0027s addiction to pills and the fact she\u0027d been boosting them from children\u0027s clinics she sponsored. And now it was all happening to me.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHe acted out a lot as a kid, holding his breath until he passed out, forcing his parents to consult doctors about his behavior. He was a navy brat and an erratic student. He knew he was going to be a military man, and he resented that his future was written before he was born.\u000A\u000AToday, the son of an admiral and grandson of another admiral runs an operation that is a civil version of Romper Room. A suite of nine McCain offices line the hallway of the Russell Building, and none of the interior doors linking them ever seem to be closed. McCain hunkers in a nice chamber (marble fireplace, autographed Ted Williams baseball on the mantel, Barry Goldwater photographs of Native Americans on the wall and, for that matter, Goldwater\u0027s old desk) with staff flying in and out, many calling him John, as if he were the hotel concierge.\u000A\u000AA young girl, Jordan Weaver, ambles in with her dad, John Weaver, part of McCain\u0027s brain trust for the 2000 presidential campaign. (Last spring Weaver switched parties, moving to the Democrats—out of disgust, he tells me, a complete \u0022disillusionment with the Republican Party being tied to the corporate elite.\u0022 He says, \u0022McCain is optimistic he can move the party to the center,\u0022 but he himself lost the faith.) Weaver\u0027s girl is clutching a stuffed cow decked out in cowboy boots and a dress and soon has the senator in a deep discussion on how to get the stink off her skunk-plagued pet dog (the conservative remedy is offered—tomato juice). It goes like that in his office, a kind of salon, periodically punctuated by phone calls with his wife: \u0022\u0027Ow are ya?\u0022 he always begins.\u000A\u000AI ask him about Mo. The late Morris Udall was a liberal Democratic Arizona congressman who made his reputation on the passage of major environmental bills, an antic 1976 run for the presidency and his self-deprecating wit. When John McCain first came to the House, in 1982, as a newly minted conservative Republican, Udall took him under his wing, despite their different party loyalties. Later, when Udall was confined to a Washington hospital, slowly wasting away from Parkinson\u0027s disease, McCain would stop by to brief him on what was going on in Congress. As the years went by, Udall could not speak or signal any understanding of what was said to him. Still, McCain kept coming and giving his reports on politics, gossip and life on the Hill. When Udall\u0027s biographers approached McCain about the matter, he would not even talk to them, as if they were seeking to trespass on some private part of himself.\u000A\u000AI ask why.\u000A\u000AHe stammers that Udall was a friend. I point out that Mo Udall had lots of friends who did not come by to speak to essentially a living mummy.\u000A\u000AAnd then McCain\u0027s soft voice tightens as he explains, \u0022Because I loved him; I loved him. I say that unreservedly.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe pauses, then asks, \u0022Wouldn\u0027t you want to go see someone you loved?\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd I think, yes, but I also think that John McCain was the one man on the Hill who knew in his bones what it felt like to be a prisoner.\u000A\u000AAnd then a magazine photographer pops in and McCain is back to his Romper Room mode, joking and posing by his mantel with a bust of Theodore Roosevelt.\u000A\u000AMcCain often tries to shelter himself by keeping things light. As a POW, he taught a world-history class to what he jokes was \u0022truly a captive audience.\u0022 When he finished, his fellow POWs asked him to repeat the class. So he did, fighting boredom by rewriting history. When he got to the eighteenth-century struggle for power in North America, the French and Indian War, he suddenly had the French army attacking Delhi in India. One prisoner in the audience complained that this was clearly impossible.\u000A\u000AMcCain responded, \u0022Fuck you; you teach it,\u0022 and sat down.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AMcCain is reported to have gotten over his famous tendency for temper tantrums. Former Arizona attorney general Grant Woods has tales of McCain\u0027s fits. An old mayor of Phoenix, Paul Johnson, has similar stories. The current Republican governor of Arizona, Jane Hull, was so angered by McCain\u0027s yelling at her over the phone that she endorsed George Bush in the 2000 primary. For years McCain has been chased by stories of his sharp tongue and explosive temper. During the fight to confirm his friend John Tower as secretary of defense in the first Bush administration, McCain called a senatorial opponent of the nomination \u0022a lying, backstabbing coward\u0022 with his face an inch from the other senator\u0027s. He celebrated another colleague as \u0022a goddamn liar.\u0022\u000A\u000ANow he says he\u0027s learned to curb his anger for a simple reason: \u0022In my earliest years, I was given to outbursts of temper—not so much with people as with the failure of Congress. I realized it was harmful to have this reputation. And deserve it. But I\u0027ve learned to control it.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not hard to understand why he might have mended his ways: McCain is the product of a culture of incessant review and criticism, the officer corps, where a constant winnowing goes on to derail most careers before they reach the real levers of power.\u000A\u000AMany people have pointed to the importance of McCain\u0027s years of prison and torture, but it is almost a false trail. McCain was shaped before it.\u000A\u000A\u0022I was trained to endure it,\u0022 he explains. \u0022It was part of the profession. One of the things [being a POW] did for me was that before I was sent to prison, there was always the question of am I being treated this way because I am the admiral\u0027s son? Prison removed that cloud. I could achieve my independence.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen he got back, on crutches, hair now gray, he went into physical therapy to regain his flight status (he barely qualified) and pulled strings to get a command. He was successful at his new posting. But he realized he was physically marginal and that he could never achieve what his father and grandfather had achieved in the navy. So he left. He considered running for Congress from Florida. And then he met and married his second wife, a Phoenix beer heiress, Cindy Hensley, with a fortune of about $30 million, and set his sights on a new launching pad for his ambition—Arizona, a state he knew essentially nothing about. Some critics labeled him a carpetbagger; he destroyed them by idly noting that the longest he\u0027d ever lived in any one place had been the five and a half years in Hanoi. He had never voted in his life, and registered as a Republican in part because he liked the party\u0027s support of the Cold War. His military record and new family connections easily put him in the House (\u0022a low-visibility job,\u0022 he notes), and then in 1986, when a slot opened up, he moved just as easily to the Senate. For most of the \u002780s, he was a predictable Reagan Republican, until the Keating scandal sent him reeling.\u000A\u000AWith Keating he feared he might lose his seat. But he also feared he had lost his honor, a concept that he insists is not an abstraction in his mind. In the 2000 South Carolina primary, McCain waffled over the issue of the Confederate flag flying over the statehouse, a powder-keg subject. At first he criticized the flag as \u0022a symbol of racism and slavery,\u0022 then flip-flopped for political reasons, calling it a \u0022symbol of heritage.\u0022 He now describes his waffling as \u0022not honorable behavior.\u0022 And he explains the dishonor to me this way: \u0022I was lying.\u0022\u000A\u000ATalking with McCain is to be peppered with constant examples of incidents when, he says, he was wrong about this or that or chose expedience and betrayed himself. It can be explained away as a ploy. And it is disarming. I have to slap myself and think: This self-flagellation is an easy out. But at the end of the day, I wind up believing him—in part because he did time in Hanoi, because he did succumb to the easy money of Charlie Keating, because he lied. He has stumbled, failed himself, been beaten and tortured and found out who he is. Most people don\u0027t ever find out who they are. Or want to. But once you know who and what you are, the truth comes more easily to your lips, because the good opinion that matters to you is not that of others, but of yourself.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHis politics aren\u0027t all the maverick recklessness they are credited with being. Most of the time, he is extremely predictable. He wants a big-stick military. He thinks in general the Homeland Security Department proposed by the president is a good idea. He thinks we must topple Saddam Hussein, either through crafty moves or by military force.\u000A\u000A\u0022The cost [of a war with Iraq] will not be nearly as much as predicted by some,\u0022 he says. \u0022Just as I predicted the first gulf war would have a minimum of casualties, so would this one. Who is going to fight with Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi people believe he is on his way out. The surrounding Arab states would be overjoyed by his departure. What they really fear is that we will go in, then leave and Hussein will still be in power.\u0022 McCain says he\u0027ll back Bush on this one. \u0022Since the president asked for congressional approval, there\u0027s got to be some.\u0022 He sees a threat and believes it must be articulated. \u0022I think there are changed circumstances with the reality and range of the weapons of mass destruction. But you have to be careful and make the case that the threat is imminent.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe sits in his office, coat off, chair tilted back, feet up on his coffee table, giving out answers to the world\u0027s problems quickly and confidently. He thinks we can finish nation building in Afghanistan in five years. He wants the U.S. to promote democracy in Saudi Arabia.\u000A\u000AHe fidgets as he tosses out almost tape-recorded replies. In his new book, he allots a chapter to each of his personal heroes, and some sound safe and predictable. There is Teddy Roosevelt. Ted Williams. The late Senator Henry \u0022Scoop\u0022 Jackson, a Democrat with a fulsome love for the military. Billy Mitchell, the military man who fought for air power. It almost sounds like a pantheon put together by a campaign strategist.\u000A\u000AAnd then suddenly there is a section on Emiliano Zapata, the great peasant leader of the Mexican revolution, and, my God, McCain is remembering the first time he saw Marlon Brando in Viva Zapata! (1952) and how he has watched the film countless times since then. \u0022I usually watch it every six months or so,\u0022 he tells me. He likes Zapata, he says, because the guy stuck to his principles. And he\u0027s not faking it: He knows John Steinbeck worked like a dog writing the script; he repeats lines from the movie verbatim. And when I touch on the historiography of Zapata, boom, he has an aide come over and write down the titles from the Library of Congress, and a week later when we talk on the phone, he fields my political questions like shuttlecocks in badminton and then wants to \u0022digress,\u0022 as he puts it, and is off into the Zapata reading list I gave him, and his questions are not based on Cliffs Notes.\u000A\u000AOr he is a boy and idly pulls a book from the shelf in his father\u0027s library, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Hemingway\u0027s novel of the Spanish Civil War. He devours it and fantasizes about being the hero, Robert Jordan, an American fighting the Fascists who gets the girl but dies defending the Republic. And McCain makes it clear that what burned into his mind was being the hero, the man of ideals who stood for something and fought for it. Later I run his list of heroes by a woman I\u0027m talking with and she says, \u0022That\u0027s a boy\u0027s list of heroes.\u0022 And, of course, she is right. John McCain is a boy, but then, so am I.\u000A\u000ABut what intrigues me are the two scenes in the Zapata movie that McCain has all but memorized. In the beginning of the film, the dictator of Mexico is hearing out some peasants when one of them, Zapata, speaks up. The dictator turns to his aide and says write down that man\u0027s name—meaning, have him killed. Later in the movie, Zapata (and this has no basis in history) has taken the dictator\u0027s power and is hearing out a delegation of peasants. One speaks up, and Zapata turns to an aide and says write down that man\u0027s name. Betrayal, betrayal of a revolution, betrayal of ideals and, for McCain, betrayal of self. After this moment, Zapata comes to his senses, grabs his rifle and sides with the peasants.\u000A\u000AMcCain is constantly asked about his plans and his loyalty to George W. Bush. Of the president, he will say only that their relations are \u0022cordial, but I cannot say we are friends.\u0022\u000A\u000AOf course, he is steadily running a political agenda counter to the administration\u0027s, as he denounces corporate pillage, supports prescription-drug benefits, demands patients\u0027 rights and so forth. But he is a naval officer and will never show disrespect for his commander in chief. Just as he criticized Clinton and voted for his impeachment but refrained from the mad-dog attacks that characterized many in his party. (He tells me he is still half-admiring of \u0022Clinton\u0027s bullshit, his grasp of the issues and the way he could work a room.\u0022) Basically, McCain will never forgive Bush for the South Carolina primary, when a flyer circulated characterizing McCain\u0027s adopted Bangladeshi daughter as the love child of an illicit tryst with a black woman. Nor will he speak to that moment except to note \u0022I was angry in South Carolina.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe tries not to be bitter about the election and says, \u0022I think about the crowds; I think about the great things. That\u0027s the best way to look back, or I\u0027d be a bitter old man. What an honor for a guy who stood fifth from the bottom of his class at Annapolis.\u0022 And then he carefully and politically adds, \u0022The agenda I\u0027m pursuing has nothing to do with presidential ambitions.\u0022\u000A\u000ALately, he\u0027s made an almost aerobic ercise of fobbing off answers to questions about these ambitions. Will he run as an Independent, like his hero T. R. did in 1912?\u000A\u000A\u0022Well,\u0022 he tosses back, \u0022Theodore Roosevelt felt that he was robbed at the Republican Convention, and there is ample evidence that he was. My circumstances are very different from that. I think it would be hard to envision a scenario where I would run at all. But, well, you know, you have to look at things as they come.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOne day last Summer, a letter came to McCain\u0027s Senate office from one Willie Ravenel. It contained photographs of the letter writer\u0027s father: one of him as an American soldier in Patton\u0027s Third Army in Germany in \u002744, the other of him coaching junior-varsity football years later. McCain stares at the photographs, tells his staff to get them framed, takes them over to the wall behind his desk, and says, there, put them up there.\u000A\u000ARecently, McCain had given a tribute to the letter writer\u0027s father, William B. Ravenel, who was McCain\u0027s English teacher at Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. Ravenel had won a Silver Star with Patton and before that had been a football hero. He turned the young McCain on to Shakespeare, the short stories of Somerset Maugham, a whole universe of things. He became, like Zapata, T. R. and Ted Williams, an ideal, and more important, he was the man the teenage McCain turned to for advice.\u000A\u000AWhen McCain was in prison, Ravenel was the person he thought of, the odd image that helped keep him going. \u0022I knew,\u0022 he explains, \u0022he could understand why I was successful and why I failed.\u0022 When he got out and came home after half a decade of isolation and little or no news, Ravenel was the guy he wanted to see. McCain wanted to explain what happened to him, and by that he meant his signing of a confession as a war criminal, an act that McCain persists in seeing as his failure, a betrayal of honor. But unbeknownst to McCain, Ravenel had died two years before McCain\u0027s release.\u000A\u000AAnd that\u0027s what it comes down to. Not the white-hot ambition or the pratfalls of his career. It always comes back to the navy, to stoic military values, to being worthy of ideals drummed into him by his father, the academy and the corps. What he thinks of George W. Bush becomes a detail. What his schemes are for obtaining higher office become typical.\u000A\u000AHe nearly stutters when he considers his fitness for the presidency: \u0022I\u0027m convinced in some areas I have enough expertise to know what is good for the country. When you go flying with a guy and a surface-to-air missile blows him away, you get a sense of the transient nature of life. I always believed in a cause greater than oneself.\u0022 At times he can sound as if he regards the last election as a practice run. \u0022I think a lot of the fundamentals were there, but I view the 2000 campaign as a learning experience. I had to learn about the issues.\u0022 He shields himself with the assessment that \u0022I don\u0027t want to run for president again, and I don\u0027t envision a scenario where I would.\u0022 And then he is parsing the grisly details of money and says, \u0022Anyone who runs for the presidency has to get the financial support of some part of Silicon Valley.\u0022 (He explains that he has 130,000 golden names on a computer file of donors to his 2000 run and that he can start up this money mill in an instant.)\u000A\u000AHis talk of not envisioning a scenario is a kind of polite bunk. There was no realistic scenario when he ran against George W. Bush\u0027s $70 million war chest. (\u0022The town-hall meetings changed me,\u0022 he says. He\u0027d never followed patients\u0027-rights issues. \u0022Then a woman stood up who\u0027d had a hysterectomy and suddenly people in the room were crying.\u0022) There was no realistic scenario when he bailed out over Hanoi. (\u0022It was a wonderful time,\u0022 he says of his naval flying. \u0022Things were simple in the Cold War.\u0022) There was no realistic scenario when he was roped to Charlie Keating and the savings-and-loan debacle. His core personality is that of a fighter pilot, alone in a plane making his own odds. He offers teasingly, \u0022I\u0027ve found if you do the right thing, then the rest of it takes care of itself.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe asks himself, \u0022Can I move reform, or am I a spent bullet?\u0022\u000A\u000ABut the question is really an answer, since McCain is incapable of ever seeing himself as spent. He wasn\u0027t trained that way.\u000A\u000AAnd then he is back twirling his pen, restless in his office, anxious to get his new photographs framed and hung on the wall to watch over him. He says he\u0027ll see how his party does in the midterm elections. He says he\u0027s had a good life, maybe he\u0027ll decide to go back to Arizona and relax.\u000A\u000ABut he can\u0027t sit still. Ever.\u000A\u000ACharles Bowden is a GQ writer at large. He doesn\u0027t drink white wine.",

Apart from the fine wooden lecterns, the Senate chamber is drab&#x2014;dull lighting, light paint. The walls are studded with busts of forgotten men, the first twenty vice presidents of the United States. Today, Senator John McCain has come over from his office to once again make a pitch for an amendment no one seems to want.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.2">He waits for his turn to speak, pacing. The dark gray suit frames a blue shirt with the requisite television-red tie. The skin is pale beyond what the word <em>white</em> can convey, save for the red slashes on the left side of his face, one before the jaw, one behind the ear, where surgeons have gouged out yet more melanoma. He wears sunblock for even a brief press conference outside. The morning has been a pile of newspapers, a series of one-minute meetings with staff, a bacon-and-lettuce sandwich wolfed down with a cup of coffee and then the fast walk with staff trailing, a descent in the private Senate elevator, a short ride on the Senate subway, up another elevator and down the ornate hallways, all the while talking with staff and tossing out quips. And then at 1 P.M., into the tomb of the Senate itself, the still air, the lack of sunlight, the funereal calm of an old clubhouse.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.3">More than a dozen senators are on the floor, talking about corporate responsibility. The cloakroom just off the chamber is stuffed with more of this bizarre and tiny tribe. The various senators idly visit with one another, chatting amiably. But no one sidles up to McCain. Not even his so-called friends: Six years ago, McCain chaired the presidential run of Phil Gramm of Texas. Today Gramm patently ignores him.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.5">None of McCain&#x2019;s colleagues want what he has to offer today, a motion that forces corporations to count stock options against revenue. Since 1994, when Congress approved the practice of keeping these ecutive perks off the books, it has become a form of corporate pillage, with the costs hidden from investors. But McCain finds no support for his measure from fellow Republicans or from many of the Democrats he is whispered to be courting. (In fact, Democratic leader Tom Daschle reportedly quashed an earlier version of the amendment after getting a phone call from venture capitalist John Doerr, a man who has given the Democrats $619,000 since 1999.)</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.6">So as the other senators harangue about corporate responsibility, about how an independent watchdog entity will fix this and fix that, how it&#x2019;s high time to deal with security fraud, McCain eagerly awaits his turn. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat with whom he is cosponsoring the amendment, lends McCain a tiny slice of his time.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.7">McCain has only enough time to say &quot;The fix is in,&quot; meaning he knows his colleagues will bow to corporate pressure and ignore his amendment.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.8">His brief moment over, he paces some more, hoping for another shot at speaking. But he doesn&#x2019;t get his chance. In a matter of hours, the corporate-responsibility bill will pass unanimously, without the McCain-Levin amendment, the senators wrapping themselves in a fig leaf of decency and boldly proclaiming that the new law will end the taint of scandals.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.9">And as John McCain continues to pace in the Senate chamber, his real position&#x2014;what you could call his crucial marginality&#x2014;is starkly apparent. He is, of course, the man who ignited a bizarre outpouring of support from Democrats and Independents and people who had never bothered to vote before the presidential primaries in 2000. He is the man the successful political insurgents in Bolivia and Colombia and Sri Lanka all claim they based their campaigns on. Now Slovakian reformers are begging him to come to shore up their support. <em>Saturday Night Live</em> asked him to host the show in the fall. He is the great pale hope of voters normally locked in to party politics or dismayed by any politics. He is all these things. And he is a 66-year-old veteran who cannot seem to get even an idle conversation from his colleagues.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.a">After an hour and a half of pacing, he abandons the floor without getting more than his short sentence in and without a single senator voluntarily speaking to him.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.b">It is as if he had never been there at all.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.d">John McCain admits that he is resented. He knows he is unloved by &quot;all the right wing.&quot; He knows that many of his colleagues in the Senate harbor grievances against him. After all, he&#x2019;s been stalling key federal appointments in committee so he can get the right staff placed on the commission to administer McCain-Feingold, the campaign-finance-reform bill he coauthored.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.e">&quot;I worked for seven years to get campaign-finance reform,&quot; he snaps, &quot;and then to see it shredded.&quot; He admits that in order to get what he wants, he has bruised more than a few people.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.f">But when I ask him later about his isolation on the Senate floor, he denies it, says, sure, he and the other senators have differences but he has many friends in the chamber. His staff echoes the chant. And maybe their denials are correct. It is not whether John McCain is ostracized. It is that in the end, no matter how sociable he acts, no matter how many weekends he spends with fellow senators, no matter how many jokes he cracks, he is alone. He was trained to be that way. He is a naval officer in the camouflage of a politician.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.g">&quot;I think,&quot; he allows in that accentless voice produced by the endless moving of his father&#x2019;s military career, &quot;there is a resentment about my blocking the nominations and things like that. I&#x2019;m sure there is animosity. Some blame my presidential run for Bush&#x2019;s problems in the campaign. I don&#x2019;t have a hell of a lot to say to those guys. I&#x2019;m not a backslapper.&quot; And then he trails off into that country everyone wonders about, his ambition: &quot;The reason for public service is to do public good. What&#x2019;s the most powerful place to do it?&quot; And there is no doubt he does not mean the Senate.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.h">Some things must never be forgotten about John McCain, even if he has forgotten them at moments in his life. He is always a naval officer, and because of that fact he is always in thrall to his sense of honor, and this sense of honor seems to always suggest that the rest of us are somehow lacking. This is true even when McCain himself does not act in the most honorable way. For example, he has wobbled on the corporate-responsibility front. Eight years ago, when Congress endorsed not counting stock options, nine senators voted against it; he wasn&#x2019;t one of them. McCain explains that back in 1994, he wasn&#x2019;t even aware of what he was voting for. But before you have a chance to say this is a feeble explanation, he is quick to add that his ignorance is &quot;no excuse.&quot; And it&#x2019;s this sort of frankness&#x2014;which isn&#x2019;t really much when you stop and think of it, his simple use of words like &quot;no excuse&quot;&#x2014;that gives him his power. They are small words that carry some admission of personal responsibility, so rare in American politics. With them, John McCain has been able to build a candor offensive.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.i"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.j">He walks fast, and now the heels of his black loafers click as he moves down the hallway of the Russell Senate Office Building. Staff trail him like cruisers in the wake of a battleship. &quot;Keep moving if you want to love life, and keep your troubles well behind you,&quot; he writes in his new book, <em>Worth the Fighting For.</em> On this day in July, he&#x2019;s headed to a hearing of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, where the red meat on the menu is Army Secretary Thomas E. White, formerly of Enron. Before the hearing, McCain says, &quot;I have no sympathy, but I&#x2019;m not going to be part of a public flogging.&quot; White, a bristling former brigadier general, reads an opening statement in which he denies any wrongdoing while earning millions at Enron in various electricity plays. &quot;I carried out my responsibilities in an entirely ethical manner,&quot; he says, &quot;just as I did over the twenty-eight years that I served my country in the army.&quot; Democratic senator Max Cleland, a triple-amputee Vietnam vet from Georgia, notes firmly that during his service in the army, the officers ate after the men, whereas at Enron the ecutives always ate first, and heavily.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.k">On the other side of the panel, McCain sits, ill at ease; he is always a failure at sitting still, and now his pale skin somehow seems to become dark, his jowly face hardens, and he asks how the general could possibly read a statement about his tenure at Enron that mentions no concern for the workers who lost their jobs and every cent of their pension funds.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.l">White sputters out, almost in surprise at such a question, that of course he is &quot;appalled and outraged&quot; by the apparent financial fraud that took place during his time at Enron and that he regrets what happened to the people who worked there.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.m">With that the senator rises and leaves the hearing. In the hallway, he mutters something to me about White&#x2019;s &quot;arrogance.&quot; His brisk departure is not a major political event; it is a small moment, soon to be entombed in the printed record of a Senate committee. But it contains everything that seems to baffle other politicians about John McCain. And everything that is bedrock and crystal clear to him. And this bedrock is not liberal and it is not conservative. It is absolute, primitive, unthought, unquestioned and relentless. It is about instinct and about principles drummed into the head during boyhood, and it is what often makes him a lonely and compelling man.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.n"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.o">As McCain strides the corridor to yet another Senate hearing, I throw questions at him.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.p">&quot;Senator,&quot; I ask, &quot;a one-word description of your politics: liberal, moderate, conservative or communist?&quot; He starts to speak, then pauses, then fires up again, then pauses, then says, &quot;T. R.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.q">He adds: &quot;Teddy Roosevelt Republican.&quot; Then another pause and &quot;But I&#x2019;m really still a conservative.&quot; One more pause and &quot;Make that a Teddy Roosevelt Republican.&quot; McCain has two levels of talk: a boilerplate of sentences for issues, and this other discourse of sentence fragments for things he is responding to in the moment. Then he vanishes into a committee hearing, where he decries &quot;special interests&quot; and &quot;big-money lobbyists, some of them in this room.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.r">He is striding from his car to his office.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.s">&quot;Senator,&quot; I ask, &quot;how can these liberal pundits be floating the idea of you running as a Democrat when you have a conservative record?&quot; At first he looks a bit irked at the notion, pauses, cocks his head and seems to become a freeze-frame. Then he agrees, explains why his record will never add up to a Democrat: &quot;I&#x2019;m pro-life, pro&#x2014;missile defense, pro&#x2014;privatizing Social Security, pro&#x2014;school vouchers and an unqualified supporter of free trade.&quot; And he is a stone-cold soldier in the War on Drugs: &quot;To legalize hard drugs would be a mistake,&quot; he intones. And then he adds that dollop of candor that always seems to pop out of his senatorial mouth by noting that when his doctors gave him painkillers for surgery, it was &quot;the most euphoric feeling I&#x2019;ve ever had in my life.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.t">Of course, for John McCain life is not about euphoria; it is not even in the end about rights. It is about personal responsibility. He tells me he dislikes being called a maverick because &quot;the appellation means someone who is wild.&quot; But he lives on political energy that seems untrustworthy to his own party&#x2014;his campaign-finance-reform legislation was viewed by Republicans as lethal to their major asset, the checkbook.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.u">I ask him if he worries about being seen as a party traitor, and he answers crisply: &quot;I already am.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.v"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.w">The voice is soft, almost shipping the words out in a warm fuzz. The hazel eyes are alert, pilot&#x2019;s eyes, and the smiles come easily, as if life were one long smoker in an officers&#x2019; club. McCain has that ease with being male, the calm been-there-done-that manner. The body movements are somewhat jerky now, the arms held out as if somehow pinned away from the torso, the shoulders stiff and not relad&#x2014;all this baggage from a bad parachute landing followed by beatings and torture in the Hanoi Hilton when he was a prisoner for five and a half years during the Vietnam War. He can&#x2019;t lift his arms very high, can&#x2019;t comb his hair or brush lint off his shoulders.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.x">He is being updated by his staff on various bills as he sits in a tilted chair, coat off, pen twirling in one hand: how cable companies will be affected by broadband changes (&quot;I don&#x2019;t care; they are all liars&quot;); should commercial-airline pilots have guns in the cockpit; what about this new fire-safe-cigarette bill? When they get to the generic-drug bill, he snorts, almost as a recreation, that the pharmaceutical corporations are &quot;greedy bastards.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.y">Then it is out to his car&#x2014;he drives himself, of course; fighter pilots always take the wheel&#x2014;and off to a radio station to tape his half of his regular point/counterpoint face-off with Ted Kennedy. &quot;The good news is that it is on hundreds of stations,&quot; he explains. &quot;The bad news is they seem to broadcast it around five in the morning.&quot; (He also parachutes regularly into the Don Imus show, because &quot;when I&#x2019;m going against the grain, it is useful.&quot;) McCain stumbles through the script with brief bouts of dry mouth and coughing and then hits some standard safe riffs: Ted Williams is an American hero, the Pledge of Allegiance should retain the phrase <em>under God</em> (&quot;Give me a break,&quot; he protests), Amtrak is pork barrel, and as for capital punishment, well, some people deserve to die. He rips through these routine partisan shots while framed by the glass window of the sound booth and a bumper sticker on the wall that says invest in america / buy a congressman. As he leaves the station, he thanks each employee individually.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.z">McCain can sound all the right notes, but he doesn&#x2019;t always follow them. A few days earlier, he gave an address denouncing &quot;crony capitalism,&quot; &quot;sweetheart loans,&quot; &quot;reckless greed&quot; and &quot;lobbyists crawling all over Capitol Hill&quot; and called for sacking the Bush-appointed head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Harvey Pitt.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.10">This after he took $31,000 from the busted Global Crossing, the highest in the Senate between 1997 and 2001; $23,900 from on-the-skids WorldCom, third highest in the Senate; $23,250 from the extinct Arthur Andersen, fabled chef of Enron&#x2019;s cooked books; and $9,500 from Enron itself. The <em>National Review</em> looked at these numbers and called him a hypocrite.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.11">I bring up one of his been-there-done-that moments from the past, his involvement with Charles Keating, the poster boy of the 1980s savings-and-loan scandal, a financial hole that cost more than the Vietnam War. McCain received $112,000 in contributions from Keating and his associates, vacationed with him on his island in the Bahamas, flew around on his corporate jet and, along with four other senators, confronted federal regulators trying to shut down Keating&#x2019;s operation. I once coauthored a book on Keating, and so I am a veritable warehouse of niggling details on the case. When the dust settled from the scandal, McCain got off with a slap on the wrist from the Senate Ethics Committee.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.12">So, I ask, what came over you to get involved with a highflier like Charlie Keating, a classic wheeler-dealer who had already been flogged once by the SEC?</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.13">He stumbles about how Keating was an early supporter, a leading business figure in his home state, but then drops this effort. As he remembers those days and speaks of the damage the scandal did to him and his career, the straight-talk express hits.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.14">&quot;I saw everything I stood for and aspired to,&quot; he says quietly, the voice even softer than usual, &quot;disappearing before my eyes. Certain standards that were expected of me by my father and grandfather. My father kept my grandfather alive for me; he revered him. I&#x2019;d betrayed the public trust. I had performed in a manner that created the impression of improper behavior. It is one thing to think you&#x2019;ve been unjustly prosecuted; it is another thing to think you really shouldn&#x2019;t have done what you did.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.15">When McCain is cornered, his candor is a weapon of last resort, something lobbed out from the foxhole. The weapon is his press offensive. He is the senator who will tell it to reporters straight, warts and all. Deploying just the right measure of candor, he bombards the press with direct answers and by this act cows them.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.16">Especially on Keating. In 1991 I watched him testify at the Los Angeles criminal trial while Charlie Keating glowered at him from the defense table. McCain never made eye contact with his old vacation host at Cat Cay. And he walked woodenly through a crowd of oldsters, ruined by their purchases of Keating&#x2019;s junk bonds, who lurked outside the courtroom like a demented Greek chorus. I was underwhelmed.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.17">I&#x2019;ve just read the galleys of McCain&#x2019;s new book, in which he states that he last saw Keating in the spring of 1987. When I mention that this 1991 event is missing from the new book, McCain is stunned and quickly makes a note to have it corrected. When I say, &quot;Did you block out the memory? I was there, and you were very uncomfortable,&quot; he sputters and then allows that, yes, it was not a good day for him. And now, my God, I actually believe him. I believe him, even though he wrote that he &quot;never laid eyes&quot; on Keating after March 24, 1987. When McCain ran for president in 2000, I&#x2019;d scan the press and think he was being handled with kid gloves by a bunch of reporters starstruck by his horrific war experience. I kept looking for some real examinations of his involvement with Keating, of his legendary temper explosions, of his war with the Arizona press when they accurately reported his wife&#x2019;s addiction to pills and the fact she&#x2019;d been boosting them from children&#x2019;s clinics she sponsored. And now it was all happening to me.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.18"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.19">He acted out a lot as a kid, holding his breath until he passed out, forcing his parents to consult doctors about his behavior. He was a navy brat and an erratic student. He knew he was going to be a military man, and he resented that his future was written before he was born.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1a">Today, the son of an admiral and grandson of another admiral runs an operation that is a civil version of <em>Romper Room.</em> A suite of nine McCain offices line the hallway of the Russell Building, and none of the interior doors linking them ever seem to be closed. McCain hunkers in a nice chamber (marble fireplace, autographed Ted Williams baseball on the mantel, Barry Goldwater photographs of Native Americans on the wall and, for that matter, Goldwater&#x2019;s old desk) with staff flying in and out, many calling him John, as if he were the hotel concierge.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1b">A young girl, Jordan Weaver, ambles in with her dad, John Weaver, part of McCain&#x2019;s brain trust for the 2000 presidential campaign. (Last spring Weaver switched parties, moving to the Democrats&#x2014;out of disgust, he tells me, a complete &quot;disillusionment with the Republican Party being tied to the corporate elite.&quot; He says, &quot;McCain is optimistic he can move the party to the center,&quot; but he himself lost the faith.) Weaver&#x2019;s girl is clutching a stuffed cow decked out in cowboy boots and a dress and soon has the senator in a deep discussion on how to get the stink off her skunk-plagued pet dog (the conservative remedy is offered&#x2014;tomato juice). It goes like that in his office, a kind of salon, periodically punctuated by phone calls with his wife: &quot;&#x2019;Ow are ya?&quot; he always begins.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1c">I ask him about Mo. The late Morris Udall was a liberal Democratic Arizona congressman who made his reputation on the passage of major environmental bills, an antic 1976 run for the presidency and his self-deprecating wit. When John McCain first came to the House, in 1982, as a newly minted conservative Republican, Udall took him under his wing, despite their different party loyalties. Later, when Udall was confined to a Washington hospital, slowly wasting away from Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, McCain would stop by to brief him on what was going on in Congress. As the years went by, Udall could not speak or signal any understanding of what was said to him. Still, McCain kept coming and giving his reports on politics, gossip and life on the Hill. When Udall&#x2019;s biographers approached McCain about the matter, he would not even talk to them, as if they were seeking to trespass on some private part of himself.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1d">I ask why.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1e">He stammers that Udall was a friend. I point out that Mo Udall had lots of friends who did not come by to speak to essentially a living mummy.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1f">And then McCain&#x2019;s soft voice tightens as he explains, &quot;Because I loved him; I loved him. I say that unreservedly.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1g">He pauses, then asks, &quot;Wouldn&#x2019;t you want to go see someone you loved?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1h">And I think, yes, but I also think that John McCain was the one man on the Hill who knew in his bones what it felt like to be a prisoner.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1i">And then a magazine photographer pops in and McCain is back to his <em>Romper Room</em> mode, joking and posing by his mantel with a bust of Theodore Roosevelt.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1j">McCain often tries to shelter himself by keeping things light. As a POW, he taught a world-history class to what he jokes was &quot;truly a captive audience.&quot; When he finished, his fellow POWs asked him to repeat the class. So he did, fighting boredom by rewriting history. When he got to the eighteenth-century struggle for power in North America, the French and Indian War, he suddenly had the French army attacking Delhi in India. One prisoner in the audience complained that this was clearly impossible.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1k">McCain responded, &quot;Fuck you; you teach it,&quot; and sat down.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1l"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1m">McCain is reported to have gotten over his famous tendency for temper tantrums. Former Arizona attorney general Grant Woods has tales of McCain&#x2019;s fits. An old mayor of Phoenix, Paul Johnson, has similar stories. The current Republican governor of Arizona, Jane Hull, was so angered by McCain&#x2019;s yelling at her over the phone that she endorsed George Bush in the 2000 primary. For years McCain has been chased by stories of his sharp tongue and explosive temper. During the fight to confirm his friend John Tower as secretary of defense in the first Bush administration, McCain called a senatorial opponent of the nomination &quot;a lying, backstabbing coward&quot; with his face an inch from the other senator&#x2019;s. He celebrated another colleague as &quot;a goddamn liar.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1n">Now he says he&#x2019;s learned to curb his anger for a simple reason: &quot;In my earliest years, I was given to outbursts of temper&#x2014;not so much with people as with the failure of Congress. I realized it was harmful to have this reputation. And deserve it. But I&#x2019;ve learned to control it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1o">It&#x2019;s not hard to understand why he might have mended his ways: McCain is the product of a culture of incessant review and criticism, the officer corps, where a constant winnowing goes on to derail most careers before they reach the real levers of power.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1p">Many people have pointed to the importance of McCain&#x2019;s years of prison and torture, but it is almost a false trail. McCain was shaped before it.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1q">&quot;I was trained to endure it,&quot; he explains. &quot;It was part of the profession. One of the things [being a POW] did for me was that before I was sent to prison, there was always the question of am I being treated this way because I am the admiral&#x2019;s son? Prison removed that cloud. I could achieve my independence.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1r">When he got back, on crutches, hair now gray, he went into physical therapy to regain his flight status (he barely qualified) and pulled strings to get a command. He was successful at his new posting. But he realized he was physically marginal and that he could never achieve what his father and grandfather had achieved in the navy. So he left. He considered running for Congress from Florida. And then he met and married his second wife, a Phoenix beer heiress, Cindy Hensley, with a fortune of about $30 million, and set his sights on a new launching pad for his ambition&#x2014;Arizona, a state he knew essentially nothing about. Some critics labeled him a carpetbagger; he destroyed them by idly noting that the longest he&#x2019;d ever lived in any one place had been the five and a half years in Hanoi. He had never voted in his life, and registered as a Republican in part because he liked the party&#x2019;s support of the Cold War. His military record and new family connections easily put him in the House (&quot;a low-visibility job,&quot; he notes), and then in 1986, when a slot opened up, he moved just as easily to the Senate. For most of the &#x2019;80s, he was a predictable Reagan Republican, until the Keating scandal sent him reeling.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1s">With Keating he feared he might lose his seat. But he also feared he had lost his honor, a concept that he insists is not an abstraction in his mind. In the 2000 South Carolina primary, McCain waffled over the issue of the Confederate flag flying over the statehouse, a powder-keg subject. At first he criticized the flag as &quot;a symbol of racism and slavery,&quot; then flip-flopped for political reasons, calling it a &quot;symbol of heritage.&quot; He now describes his waffling as &quot;not honorable behavior.&quot; And he explains the dishonor to me this way: &quot;I was lying.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1t">Talking with McCain is to be peppered with constant examples of incidents when, he says, he was wrong about this or that or chose expedience and betrayed himself. It can be explained away as a ploy. And it is disarming. I have to slap myself and think: <em>This self-flagellation is an easy out.</em> But at the end of the day, I wind up believing him&#x2014;in part because he did time in Hanoi, because he did succumb to the easy money of Charlie Keating, because he lied. He has stumbled, failed himself, been beaten and tortured and found out who he is. Most people don&#x2019;t ever find out who they are. Or want to. But once you know who and what you are, the truth comes more easily to your lips, because the good opinion that matters to you is not that of others, but of yourself.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1u"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1v">His politics aren&#x2019;t all the maverick recklessness they are credited with being. Most of the time, he is extremely predictable. He wants a big-stick military. He thinks in general the Homeland Security Department proposed by the president is a good idea. He thinks we must topple Saddam Hussein, either through crafty moves or by military force.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1w">&quot;The cost [of a war with Iraq] will not be nearly as much as predicted by some,&quot; he says. &quot;Just as I predicted the first gulf war would have a minimum of casualties, so would this one. Who is going to fight with Saddam Hussein? The Iraqi people believe he is on his way out. The surrounding Arab states would be overjoyed by his departure. What they really fear is that we will go in, then leave and Hussein will still be in power.&quot; McCain says he&#x2019;ll back Bush on this one. &quot;Since the president asked for congressional approval, there&#x2019;s got to be some.&quot; He sees a threat and believes it must be articulated. &quot;I think there are changed circumstances with the reality and range of the weapons of mass destruction. But you have to be careful and make the case that the threat is imminent.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1x">He sits in his office, coat off, chair tilted back, feet up on his coffee table, giving out answers to the world&#x2019;s problems quickly and confidently. He thinks we can finish nation building in Afghanistan in five years. He wants the U.S. to promote democracy in Saudi Arabia.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1y">He fidgets as he tosses out almost tape-recorded replies. In his new book, he allots a chapter to each of his personal heroes, and some sound safe and predictable. There is Teddy Roosevelt. Ted Williams. The late Senator Henry &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, a Democrat with a fulsome love for the military. Billy Mitchell, the military man who fought for air power. It almost sounds like a pantheon put together by a campaign strategist.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.1z">And then suddenly there is a section on Emiliano Zapata, the great peasant leader of the Mexican revolution, and, my God, McCain is remembering the first time he saw Marlon Brando in <em>Viva Zapata!</em> (1952) and how he has watched the film countless times since then. &quot;I usually watch it every six months or so,&quot; he tells me. He likes Zapata, he says, because the guy stuck to his principles. And he&#x2019;s not faking it: He knows John Steinbeck worked like a dog writing the script; he repeats lines from the movie verbatim. And when I touch on the historiography of Zapata, boom, he has an aide come over and write down the titles from the Library of Congress, and a week later when we talk on the phone, he fields my political questions like shuttlecocks in badminton and then wants to &quot;digress,&quot; as he puts it, and is off into the Zapata reading list I gave him, and his questions are not based on Cliffs Notes.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.20">Or he is a boy and idly pulls a book from the shelf in his father&#x2019;s library, <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls,</em> Hemingway&#x2019;s novel of the Spanish Civil War. He devours it and fantasizes about being the hero, Robert Jordan, an American fighting the Fascists who gets the girl but dies defending the Republic. And McCain makes it clear that what burned into his mind was being the hero, the man of ideals who stood for something and fought for it. Later I run his list of heroes by a woman I&#x2019;m talking with and she says, &quot;That&#x2019;s a boy&#x2019;s list of heroes.&quot; And, of course, she is right. John McCain is a boy, but then, so am I.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.21">But what intrigues me are the two scenes in the Zapata movie that McCain has all but memorized. In the beginning of the film, the dictator of Mexico is hearing out some peasants when one of them, Zapata, speaks up. The dictator turns to his aide and says write down that man&#x2019;s name&#x2014;meaning, have him killed. Later in the movie, Zapata (and this has no basis in history) has taken the dictator&#x2019;s power and is hearing out a delegation of peasants. One speaks up, and Zapata turns to an aide and says write down that man&#x2019;s name. Betrayal, betrayal of a revolution, betrayal of ideals and, for McCain, betrayal of self. After this moment, Zapata comes to his senses, grabs his rifle and sides with the peasants.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.22">McCain is constantly asked about his plans and his loyalty to George W. Bush. Of the president, he will say only that their relations are &quot;cordial, but I cannot say we are friends.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.23">Of course, he is steadily running a political agenda counter to the administration&#x2019;s, as he denounces corporate pillage, supports prescription-drug benefits, demands patients&#x2019; rights and so forth. But he is a naval officer and will never show disrespect for his commander in chief. Just as he criticized Clinton and voted for his impeachment but refrained from the mad-dog attacks that characterized many in his party. (He tells me he is still half-admiring of &quot;Clinton&#x2019;s bullshit, his grasp of the issues and the way he could work a room.&quot;) Basically, McCain will never forgive Bush for the South Carolina primary, when a flyer circulated characterizing McCain&#x2019;s adopted Bangladeshi daughter as the love child of an illicit tryst with a black woman. Nor will he speak to that moment except to note &quot;I was angry in South Carolina.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.24">He tries not to be bitter about the election and says, &quot;I think about the crowds; I think about the great things. That&#x2019;s the best way to look back, or I&#x2019;d be a bitter old man. What an honor for a guy who stood fifth from the bottom of his class at Annapolis.&quot; And then he carefully and politically adds, &quot;The agenda I&#x2019;m pursuing has nothing to do with presidential ambitions.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.25">Lately, he&#x2019;s made an almost aerobic ercise of fobbing off answers to questions about these ambitions. Will he run as an Independent, like his hero T. R. did in 1912?</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.26">&quot;Well,&quot; he tosses back, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt felt that he was robbed at the Republican Convention, and there is ample evidence that he was. My circumstances are very different from that. I think it would be hard to envision a scenario where I would run at all. But, well, you know, you have to look at things as they come.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.27"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.28">One day last Summer, a letter came to McCain&#x2019;s Senate office from one Willie Ravenel. It contained photographs of the letter writer&#x2019;s father: one of him as an American soldier in Patton&#x2019;s Third Army in Germany in &#x2019;44, the other of him coaching junior-varsity football years later. McCain stares at the photographs, tells his staff to get them framed, takes them over to the wall behind his desk, and says, there, put them up there.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.29">Recently, McCain had given a tribute to the letter writer&#x2019;s father, William B. Ravenel, who was McCain&#x2019;s English teacher at Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. Ravenel had won a Silver Star with Patton and before that had been a football hero. He turned the young McCain on to Shakespeare, the short stories of Somerset Maugham, a whole universe of things. He became, like Zapata, T. R. and Ted Williams, an ideal, and more important, he was the man the teenage McCain turned to for advice.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.2a">When McCain was in prison, Ravenel was the person he thought of, the odd image that helped keep him going. &quot;I knew,&quot; he explains, &quot;he could understand why I was successful and why I failed.&quot; When he got out and came home after half a decade of isolation and little or no news, Ravenel was the guy he wanted to see. McCain wanted to explain what happened to him, and by that he meant his signing of a confession as a war criminal, an act that McCain persists in seeing as his failure, a betrayal of honor. But unbeknownst to McCain, Ravenel had died two years before McCain&#x2019;s release.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.2b">And that&#x2019;s what it comes down to. Not the white-hot ambition or the pratfalls of his career. It always comes back to the navy, to stoic military values, to being worthy of ideals drummed into him by his father, the academy and the corps. What he thinks of George W. Bush becomes a detail. What his schemes are for obtaining higher office become typical.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.2c">He nearly stutters when he considers his fitness for the presidency: &quot;I&#x2019;m convinced in some areas I have enough expertise to know what is good for the country. When you go flying with a guy and a surface-to-air missile blows him away, you get a sense of the transient nature of life. I always believed in a cause greater than oneself.&quot; At times he can sound as if he regards the last election as a practice run. &quot;I think a lot of the fundamentals were there, but I view the 2000 campaign as a learning experience. I had to learn about the issues.&quot; He shields himself with the assessment that &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to run for president again, and I don&#x2019;t envision a scenario where I would.&quot; And then he is parsing the grisly details of money and says, &quot;Anyone who runs for the presidency has to get the financial support of some part of Silicon Valley.&quot; (He explains that he has 130,000 golden names on a computer file of donors to his 2000 run and that he can start up this money mill in an instant.)</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.2d">His talk of not envisioning a scenario is a kind of polite bunk. There was no realistic scenario when he ran against George W. Bush&#x2019;s $70 million war chest. (&quot;The town-hall meetings changed me,&quot; he says. He&#x2019;d never followed patients&#x2019;-rights issues. &quot;Then a woman stood up who&#x2019;d had a hysterectomy and suddenly people in the room were crying.&quot;) There was no realistic scenario when he bailed out over Hanoi. (&quot;It was a wonderful time,&quot; he says of his naval flying. &quot;Things were simple in the Cold War.&quot;) There was no realistic scenario when he was roped to Charlie Keating and the savings-and-loan debacle. His core personality is that of a fighter pilot, alone in a plane making his own odds. He offers teasingly, &quot;I&#x2019;ve found if you do the right thing, then the rest of it takes care of itself.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.2e">He asks himself, &quot;Can I move reform, or am I a spent bullet?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.2f">But the question is really an answer, since McCain is incapable of ever seeing himself as spent. He wasn&#x2019;t trained that way.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.2g">And then he is back twirling his pen, restless in his office, anxious to get his new photographs framed and hung on the wall to watch over him. He says he&#x2019;ll see how his party does in the midterm elections. He says he&#x2019;s had a good life, maybe he&#x2019;ll decide to go back to Arizona and relax.</p><p data-reactid=".v58hcq42kg.1.1.0.0.4.2h">But he can&#x2019;t sit still.
