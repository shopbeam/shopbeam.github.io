  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAubrey Plaza is on her best behavior, or trying to be. \u0022If I wasn\u0027t shooting tomorrow, I\u0027d drink a lot,\u0022 she says, less than five minutes into our interview. \u0022I\u0027d burn it to the ground.\u0022 Eventually, though, the night will turn weird. Aubrey Plaza is really good at being weird.\u000A\u000ABut we\u0027re getting ahead of ourselves. It is a warm evening in early June, in an off-season ski-resort town in upstate New York, where Plaza is filming a movie. \u0022It\u0027s real bumblefucky up here!\u0022 she texted me, and the one-stoplight street is empty when I arrive. Then I see her bombing down a hill on a mountain bike.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s clear upon meeting Plaza that she is not the sarcastic, disaffected April Ludgate from Parks and Recreation, or the sarcastic, disaffected romantic interest in Funny People, or the sarcastic, disaffected hanger-on in Scott Pilgrim vs. __the World, or the sarcastic, disaffected lead from the cute indie Safety Not Guaranteed. She laughs, occasionally. She\u0027s more casually pretty than she\u0027s ever allowed to look on-screen. She does not cower into her hoodie and blink slowly at every stupid thing that\u0027s said to her. Even when I ask about her dream role.\u000A\u000A\u0022I want to be Catwoman,\u0022 she says, over dinner at the only restaurant open on a Monday night. She lets the edge of her lip lift just the smallest amount, a hint of a smile. \u0022I want my shot at Catwoman, and I want it soon.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn the meantime, she\u0027s starring in The To Do List, in which she finally plays a character who doesn\u0027t totally hate everything: Brandy, a valedictorian who spent all of high school focused solely on boning up for college and now decides to spend the summer boning up on her boning. It\u0027s the kind of funny, raunchy coming-of-age comedy that will be seared into the minds of the teenagers who see it—American Pie or Superbad for kids born during the Clinton administration. The movie is set just after Clinton was elected, which brings Plaza to her favorite sex act among the many on display: \u0022I liked angrily masturbating. I say my own name, which you kind of think could be hot in a way, but it doesn\u0027t come off that way. I\u0027m like, \u0027C\u0027mon, Brandy. You got this, Brandy.\u0027 But I have two hands up my vagina and I\u0027m just staring, and I\u0027m wearing a Hillary Clinton T-shirt.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat scene aside (we assume) Plaza\u0027s portrayal of a Type-A student is a sort of homecoming role for her. \u0022I was president of every club that I could be president of,\u0022 she says. \u0022Class president. Student council president, which is the ultimate.\u0022 She played volleyball and softball; she still plays softball. But so far, the idea that Aubrey Plaza = April Ludgate has been hard to kick.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m generally really interested in things and people,\u0022 she says. \u0022And I like things and people. I think literally April says that she doesn\u0027t like things or people.\u0022\u000A\u000AI point out that \u0022liking things and people\u0022 is maybe the most noncommittal way to like anything.\u000A\u000A \u0022You\u0027re right,\u0022 she says. Her eyes flare. She does this when excited by the possibility of a witty exchange—flares her eyes the way some people flare their nostrils. She says \u0022Yes, that\u0027s right,\u0022 instinctively, constantly, a quirk of her improv training in the Upright Citizens Brigade; she has a shoot-first-ask-later approach to comedy, and conversation, and life in general, which is why she keeps walking into trouble.\u000A\u000AYes, about that. Plaza has managed to torpedo nearly every public appearance she\u0027s made within recent memory. On The Ellen DeGeneres Show, she came on stage doing such a strange, nearly invisible dance move—it seemed that she was rowing a tiny boat—that the host welcomed her with a reprimand: \u0022That was such lack of commitment to dancing, if that\u0027s what that was.\u0022 On a morning news program, she wore fake teeth onto the set for no reason. Most famously, she walked onstage this spring while Will Ferrell was accepting an MTV Movie Award and attempted to take the statue out of his hands. It didn\u0027t work. Then she sat down. It only seemed to reinforce the misconception that she is as awkward as any of her characters.\u000A\u000A\u0022I guess I think it\u0027s better to go out there and do something interesting than to just do what everybody expects,\u0022 she says now. \u0022And that\u0027s the kind of thing that gets picked up.\u0022\u000A\u000ADessert menus arrive, and despite a dairy allergy and a propensity for sugar highs, she orders something called a chocolate-mousse bombe. Pretty soon, she worries that she\u0027s begun to spiral into that magnificently awkward place. (\u0022Oh God, everything I said was wrong\u0022). She kind of is. (\u0022It exploded all over my insides,\u0022 she says when the waitress collects what\u0027s left of the mousse bombe. \u0022If I die I\u0027ll just sue you guys.\u0022)\u000A\u000AMy phone rings. \u0022Who\u0027s that, your wife?\u0022 she asks. I tell her it\u0027s my girlfriend.\u000A\u000A\u0022Tell her you\u0027re staying here for the night,\u0022 she says, \u0022because a murderer kidnapped you.\u0022 Her eyes flare. \u0022What if you find out I\u0027m not shooting a movie here? I\u0027m going to follow you on my bike and kill you.\u0022\u000A\u000AOutside, it\u0027s getting dark, and cold, and I offer to give her a lift back to her rented house. Together, we manage to shove Plaza\u0027s also-rented mountain bike into the trunk of my car. She suggests that perhaps she did not show up on a bike, wearing a helmet and a hoodie. \u0022Aubrey Plaza arrived in a stretch limousine and a Zac Posen, um, shift dress,\u0022 she says. \u0022And an effortless... um....\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022She looked like she was born to wear high heels?\u0022 I suggest.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yes,\u0022 she says. \u0022That\u0027s right.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen we arrive at her place, she invites me in to show me the knife that she\u0027d kill me with. It\u0027s sitting on the built-in bookshelf next to her bed. \u0022This is it,\u0022 she says. \u0022I practice picking it up quickly.\u0022 She perches on the bed and picks it up, twice, quickly.\u000A\u000AIt is not clear if she is fucking with me. But this is exactly the point. Aubrey Plaza isn\u0027t awkward, not really: She\u0027s operating on a subtle frequency between sincerity and artifice, between humoring an interviewer and trolling him, between pretending not to try and committing completely. Will Ferrell should have handed her that damn statue, and who knows what would have happened next.\u000A\u000ASo this is what a night with her is like: She makes the most of every opening. The next day I listen to my recording of our dinner. I start to skip a part where I walked away from the table. But then...\u000A\u000A\u0022Vagina,\u0022 she says into the voice recorder. \u0022Penis. Balls.\u0022 She starts laughing to herself. \u0022Old person\u0027s penis. With a top hat on it. And a mustache. On the beach.\u0022\u000A\u000A Silence.\u000A\u000A \u0022Penis, vagina, penis, vagina, penis, vagina. Penis penis. Aaaand penis.\u0022",

Aubrey Plaza is really good at being weird.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.2">But we&#x2019;re getting ahead of ourselves. It is a warm evening in early June, in an off-season ski-resort town in upstate New York, where Plaza is filming a movie. &quot;It&#x2019;s real bumblefucky up here!&quot; she texted me, and the one-stoplight street is empty when I arrive. Then I see her bombing down a hill on a mountain bike.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.3">It&#x2019;s clear upon meeting Plaza that she is not the sarcastic, disaffected April Ludgate from <em>Parks and Recreation,</em> or the sarcastic, disaffected romantic interest in <em>Funny People,</em> or the sarcastic, disaffected hanger-on in <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. __the World,</em> or the sarcastic, disaffected lead from the cute indie <em>Safety Not Guaranteed.</em> She laughs, occasionally. She&#x2019;s more casually pretty than she&#x2019;s ever allowed to look on-screen. She does not cower into her hoodie and blink slowly at every stupid thing that&#x2019;s said to her. Even when I ask about her dream role.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.5">&quot;I want to be Catwoman,&quot; she says, over dinner at the only restaurant open on a Monday night. She lets the edge of her lip lift just the smallest amount, a hint of a smile. &quot;I want my shot at Catwoman, and I want it soon.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.6">In the meantime, she&#x2019;s starring in <em>The To Do List,</em> in which she finally plays a character who doesn&#x2019;t totally hate everything: Brandy, a valedictorian who spent all of high school focused solely on boning up for college and now decides to spend the summer boning up on her boning. It&#x2019;s the kind of funny, raunchy coming-of-age comedy that will be seared into the minds of the teenagers who see it&#x2014;<em>American Pie </em>or <em>Superbad</em> for kids born during the Clinton administration. The movie is set just after Clinton was elected, which brings Plaza to her favorite sex act among the many on display: &quot;I liked angrily masturbating. I say my own name, which you kind of think could be hot in a way, but it doesn&#x2019;t come off that way. I&#x2019;m like, &#x2019;C&#x2019;mon, Brandy. You got this, Brandy.&#x2019; But I have two hands up my vagina and I&#x2019;m just staring, and I&#x2019;m wearing a Hillary Clinton T-shirt.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.7">That scene aside (we assume) Plaza&#x2019;s portrayal of a Type-A student is a sort of homecoming role for her. &quot;I was president of every club that I could be president of,&quot; she says. &quot;Class president. Student council president, which is the ultimate.&quot; She played volleyball and softball; she <em>still</em> plays softball. But so far, the idea that Aubrey Plaza = April Ludgate has been hard to kick.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.8">&quot;I&#x2019;m generally really interested in things and people,&quot; she says. &quot;And I like things and people. I think literally April says that she doesn&#x2019;t like things or people.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.9">I point out that &quot;liking things and people&quot; is maybe the most noncommittal way to like anything.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.a"> &quot;You&#x2019;re right,&quot; she says. Her eyes flare. She does this when excited by the possibility of a witty exchange&#x2014;flares her eyes the way some people flare their nostrils. She says &quot;Yes, that&#x2019;s right,&quot; instinctively, constantly, a quirk of her improv training in the Upright Citizens Brigade; she has a shoot-first-ask-later approach to comedy, and conversation, and life in general, which is why she keeps walking into trouble.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.b">Yes, about that. Plaza has managed to torpedo nearly every public appearance she&#x2019;s made within recent memory. On <em>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</em>, she came on stage doing such a strange, nearly invisible dance move&#x2014;it seemed that she was rowing a tiny boat&#x2014;that the host welcomed her with a reprimand: &quot;That was such lack of commitment to dancing, if that&#x2019;s what that was.&quot; On a morning news program, she wore fake teeth onto the set for no reason. Most famously, she walked onstage this spring while Will Ferrell was accepting an MTV Movie Award and attempted to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDjFPLA3EZQ">take the statue out of his hands</a>. It didn&#x2019;t work. Then she sat down. It only seemed to reinforce the misconception that she is as awkward as any of her characters.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.c">&quot;I guess I think it&#x2019;s better to go out there and do something interesting than to just do what everybody expects,&quot; she says now. &quot;And that&#x2019;s the kind of thing that gets picked up.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.d">Dessert menus arrive, and despite a dairy allergy and a propensity for sugar highs, she orders something called a chocolate-mousse bombe. Pretty soon, she worries that she&#x2019;s begun to spiral into that magnificently awkward place. (&quot;Oh God, everything I said was wrong&quot;). She kind of is. (&quot;It exploded all over my insides,&quot; she says when the waitress collects what&#x2019;s left of the mousse bombe. &quot;If I die I&#x2019;ll just sue you guys.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.e">My phone rings. &quot;Who&#x2019;s that, your wife?&quot; she asks. I tell her it&#x2019;s my girlfriend.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.f">&quot;Tell her you&#x2019;re staying here for the night,&quot; she says, &quot;because a murderer kidnapped you.&quot; Her eyes flare. &quot;What if you find out I&#x2019;m not shooting a movie here? I&#x2019;m going to follow you on my bike and kill you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.g">Outside, it&#x2019;s getting dark, and cold, and I offer to give her a lift back to her rented house. Together, we manage to shove Plaza&#x2019;s also-rented mountain bike into the trunk of my car. She suggests that perhaps she did not show up on a bike, wearing a helmet and a hoodie. &quot;Aubrey Plaza arrived in a stretch limousine and a Zac Posen, um, shift dress,&quot; she says. &quot;And an effortless... um....&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.h">&quot;She looked like she was born to wear high heels?&quot; I suggest.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;Yes,&quot; she says. &quot;That&#x2019;s right.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.j">When we arrive at her place, she invites me in to show me the knife that she&#x2019;d kill me with. It&#x2019;s sitting on the built-in bookshelf next to her bed. &quot;This is it,&quot; she says. &quot;I practice picking it up quickly.&quot; She perches on the bed and picks it up, twice, quickly.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.k">It is not clear if she is fucking with me. But this is exactly the point. Aubrey Plaza isn&#x2019;t awkward, not really: She&#x2019;s operating on a subtle frequency between sincerity and artifice, between humoring an interviewer and trolling him, between pretending not to try and committing completely. Will Ferrell should have handed her that damn statue, and who knows what would have happened next.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.l">So this is what a night with her is like: She makes the most of every opening. The next day I listen to my recording of our dinner. I start to skip a part where I walked away from the table. But then...</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.m">&quot;Vagina,&quot; she says into the voice recorder. &quot;Penis. Balls.&quot; She starts laughing to herself. &quot;Old person&#x2019;s penis. With a top hat on it. And a mustache. On the beach.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.n"> Silence.</p><p data-reactid=".xnrbpdwtts.1.1.0.0.4.o"> &quot;Penis, vagina, penis, vagina, penis, vagina. Penis penis.
