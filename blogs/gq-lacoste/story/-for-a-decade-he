  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFor a decade, he was known throughout the league as the crafty, brainy, pesky glue guy who teammates loved and opponents despised. But Shane Battier didn\u0027t win an NBA title--had never even reached the Finals--until this month, when his Miami Heat knocked off the upstart Oklahoma City Thunder in five games. On the eve of the NBA Draft, GQ spoke with Battier about Draft Night fashion, his unforgettable meeting with Red Foo from LMFAO, and Duke\u0027s not-so-hot reputation outside of Durham, North Carolina. Oh, and that LeBron guy, too.\u000A\u000A My friends and I were debating this over the weekend and, as someone who\u0027s charitable foundation is called the Battier Take Charge Foundation, you seem like the right guy to settle it: Is it ever acceptable to take a charge in a pickup basketball game?\u000A\u000A [laughs] It\u0027s only acceptable to take a charge in pickup when it\u0027s Game Point. When winning and staying on the court is at stake, I think anything goes. Taking a charge is absolutely acceptable.\u000A\u000A Oh, c\u0027mon! If anything, it\u0027s just the opposite--every point but Game Point is acceptable.\u000A\u000A If you feel that way, you don\u0027t know anything about winning. When it\u0027s winning time, it\u0027s anything goes. Anything.\u000A\u000AThe 2012 NBA Draft is Thursday night. The fashion\u0027s going to be noteworthy, it always is. Where\u0027d you buy your suit for Draft Night 2001? \u000A\u000A I had a local tailor from Birmingham, Michigan design and make me my Draft Night suit. It was a very conservative look. Very beige. This was back in 2001, and for whatever reason, khaki was really in at the time. I still have it in my closet and it actually still fits. But it was a four-button, long, beige suit. You can\u0027t wear that in public anymore.\u000A\u000A Michael Lewis went into great detail about the way you approach covering Kobe Bryant back in a New York Times Magazine piece in 2009. Who\u0027s the most difficult player in the NBA to D up one-on-one now?\u000A\u000A Kevin Durant. He doesn\u0027t have any weaknesses and he can get his shot off pretty much whenever and wherever he wants to. And there\u0027s not much you can do about it, really. All the top guys get my full attention. My job is to know them better than they know themselves. That involves a lot of math, a lot of numbers, and a lot of figures. I study the efficiencies. Does he like going to his left? Does he prefer going to his right? What\u0027s his best shot? Is his best shot going to the rim with his right hand? Is his worst shot a jump hook over his left shoulder? My job is to know the best-case and worst-case scenarios--in order--for each of those top guys.\u000A\u000A Do you track all that in some special, big notebook or is it all just in your head?\u000A\u000A Over the years, I\u0027ve built up pretty large files on all of the top players. I take copious notes and figure out what works and what doesn\u0027t on each guy. I\u0027ve got notes and data on all of them.\u000A\u000A There were some great shots of you at Club LIV the other night, celebrating with your teammates and the dudes from LMFAO. What\u0027s a conversation like between Shane Battier and that Red Foo guy?\u000A\u000A I actually ran into him and we spoke for a while. [Laughs] I told him I respected his work and wished him best of luck with everything. He reciprocated those comments to me. He makes some music for the younger crowd. I\u0027m too old to be jumping around to those songs, but I did know who they were. I even knew his name. Red Foo. I get points for that, I think.\u000A\u000AChristian Laettner got one in 2006 before he retired and Danny Ferry got one in 2003, but for whatever reason, Duke guys haven\u0027t won that many NBA championships. What\u0027s it feel like to be one of the few to accomplish that feat?\u000A\u000A Well, it feels pretty good. Grant Hill\u0027s been my hero since I was in grade school. So, anything that I can do or achieve that Grant Hill never did--that...well, that makes my life.\u000A\u000A About 24 hours after you guys won the NBA championship, there were Steve Nash and Ray Allen to the Heat rumors online. Have you ever played with either of those two guys?\u000A\u000A You know, I\u0027ve never played with either one of those guys. Our front office will have to make several decisions on the roster this off-season. I assume there will be no shortage of players who\u0027ll want to join us and come to Miami and have a chance to win an NBA Championship next season.\u000A\u000A There\u0027s been a lot of conversation about the 1992 Dream Team this month. There\u0027s the NBA TV documentary, the oral history in this July\u0027s GQ, and there\u0027s a book coming out next month. You were on the 2006 World Championship Team that finished in third place in Japan. What went wrong there?\u000A\u000A Nothing went wrong there. I\u0027d make the argument that our losing in 2006 set the stage for the gold medal in Beijing in 2008. After winning the championship with the Heat, I realized that you have to go through some dark times, some adversity, and some fire before becoming a champion. In \u002706, we hadn\u0027t been through those fires yet. We hadn\u0027t been tested. We were so young. Although we only won the bronze that year, it created the urgency and the desire for USA Basketball to come out on top in 2008. Third place in 2006 was essential for first place in 2008. If you look at it that way, nothing went wrong at all. Those guys needed that experience in Japan to do what they did in Beijing.\u000A\u000A In 2010, GQ named Duke the second douchiest college in all of America. What\u0027s your stance on all the Duke hate out there?\u000A\u000A Usually, the individuals who say that are the ones who got wait listed or rejected. [laughs] There\u0027s a great misperception about Duke. People who go there are just normal people who want to do big things in life. If that makes us douchey, I guess that makes us douchey. Oh well. But people assume it\u0027s a bunch of nerds walking around with stacks and stacks of books. Duke\u0027s not just academia and basketball, though. I had a tremendous time in college and most Duke students do.\u000A\u000A Do you have a good LeBron story that maybe shows us a side we wouldn\u0027t expect?\u000A\u000A LeBron\u0027s really just a normal guy. He busts on me a lot for being older than the other guys. He\u0027ll make fun of my wardrobe and the way I talk. He calls me \u0022Shane Obama\u0022. He\u0027s a great teammate, though. What makes him so interesting is that he\u0027s really just a big kid. He just so happens to also be the best basketball player in the planet.\u000A\u000A You signed a three-year deal with Miami last off-season. Did even a small part of you consider making a joke about taking your talents down to South Beach?\u000A\u000A Nah. That would have been clich&amp;#xC3;&amp;#xA9;. I pride myself on not being a clich&amp;#xC3;&amp;#xA9;. If I would have done that--I mean, really? It\u0027s all been done. It all was said. Trust me. By now, I think that\u0027s a bit played out.",

known throughout the league as the crafty, brainy, pesky glue guy who teammates loved and opponents despised. But Shane Battier didn&#x2019;t win an NBA title--had never even reached the Finals--until this month, when his Miami Heat knocked off the upstart Oklahoma City Thunder in five games. On the eve of the NBA Draft, GQ spoke with Battier about Draft Night fashion, his unforgettable meeting with Red Foo from LMFAO, and Duke&#x2019;s not-so-hot reputation outside of Durham, North Carolina. Oh, and that LeBron guy, too.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.2"> <strong>My friends and I were debating this over the weekend and, as someone who&#x2019;s charitable foundation is called the <a href="http://takechargefoundation.com/">Battier Take Charge Foundation</a>, you seem like the right guy to settle it: Is it ever acceptable to take a charge in a pickup basketball game?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.3"> [laughs] It&#x2019;s only acceptable to take a charge in pickup when it&#x2019;s Game Point. When winning and staying on the court is at stake, I think anything goes. Taking a charge is absolutely acceptable.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>Oh, c&#x2019;mon! If anything, it&#x2019;s just the opposite--every point <em>but</em> Game Point is acceptable.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.6"> If you feel that way, you don&#x2019;t know anything about winning. When it&#x2019;s winning time, it&#x2019;s anything goes. Anything.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>The 2012 NBA Draft is Thursday night. The fashion&#x2019;s going to be noteworthy, it always is. Where&#x2019;d you buy your suit for Draft Night 2001? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.8"> I had a local tailor from Birmingham, Michigan design and make me my Draft Night suit. It was a very conservative look. Very beige. This was back in 2001, and for whatever reason, khaki was really in at the time. I still have it in my closet and it actually still fits. But it was a four-button, long, beige suit. You can&#x2019;t wear that in public anymore.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.9"> <strong>Michael Lewis went into great detail about the way you approach covering Kobe Bryant back in a New York Times Magazine piece in 2009. Who&#x2019;s the most difficult player in the NBA to D up one-on-one now?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.a"> Kevin Durant. He doesn&#x2019;t have any weaknesses and he can get his shot off pretty much whenever and wherever he wants to. And there&#x2019;s not much you can do about it, really. All the top guys get my full attention. My job is to know them better than they know themselves. That involves a lot of math, a lot of numbers, and a lot of figures. I study the efficiencies. Does he like going to his left? Does he prefer going to his right? What&#x2019;s his best shot? Is his best shot going to the rim with his right hand? Is his worst shot a jump hook over his left shoulder? My job is to know the best-case and worst-case scenarios--in order--for each of those top guys.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.b"> <strong>Do you track all that in some special, big notebook or is it all just in your head?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Over the years, I&#x2019;ve built up pretty large files on all of the top players. I take copious notes and figure out what works and what doesn&#x2019;t on each guy. I&#x2019;ve got notes and data on all of them.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.d"> <strong>There were some great shots of you at Club LIV the other night, celebrating with your teammates and the dudes from LMFAO. What&#x2019;s a conversation like between Shane Battier and that Red Foo guy?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.e"> I actually ran into him and we spoke for a while. <em>[Laughs]</em> I told him I respected his work and wished him best of luck with everything. He reciprocated those comments to me. He makes some music for the younger crowd. I&#x2019;m too old to be jumping around to those songs, but I did know who they were. I even knew his name. Red Foo. I get points for that, I think.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Christian Laettner got one in 2006 before he retired and Danny Ferry got one in 2003, but for whatever reason, Duke guys haven&#x2019;t won that many NBA championships. What&#x2019;s it feel like to be one of the few to accomplish that feat?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.g"> Well, it feels pretty good. Grant Hill&#x2019;s been my hero since I was in grade school. So, anything that I can do or achieve that Grant Hill never did--that...well, that makes my life.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.h"> <strong>About 24 hours after you guys won the NBA championship, there were Steve Nash and Ray Allen to the Heat rumors online. Have you ever played with either of those two guys?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.i"> You know, I&#x2019;ve never played with either one of those guys. Our front office will have to make several decisions on the roster this off-season. I assume there will be no shortage of players who&#x2019;ll want to join us and come to Miami and have a chance to win an NBA Championship next season.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.j"> <strong>There&#x2019;s been a lot of conversation about the 1992 Dream Team this month. There&#x2019;s the NBA TV documentary, <a href="../sports/profiles/201207/dream-team-20th-anniversary-1992-olympics-usa-basketball">the oral history in this July&#x2019;s GQ</a>, and there&#x2019;s a book coming out next month. You were on the 2006 World Championship Team that finished in third place in Japan. What went wrong there?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.k"> Nothing went wrong there. I&#x2019;d make the argument that our losing in 2006 set the stage for the gold medal in Beijing in 2008. After winning the championship with the Heat, I realized that you have to go through some dark times, some adversity, and some fire before becoming a champion. In &#x2019;06, we hadn&#x2019;t been through those fires yet. We hadn&#x2019;t been tested. We were so young. Although we only won the bronze that year, it created the urgency and the desire for USA Basketball to come out on top in 2008. Third place in 2006 was essential for first place in 2008. If you look at it that way, nothing went wrong at all. Those guys needed that experience in Japan to do what they did in Beijing.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.l"> <strong>In 2010, GQ named Duke <a href="../sports/profiles/201207/dream-team-20th-anniversary-1992-olympics-usa-basketball">the second douchiest college in all of America</a>. What&#x2019;s your stance on all the Duke hate out there?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.m"> Usually, the individuals who say that are the ones who got wait listed or rejected. <em>[laughs] </em>There&#x2019;s a great misperception about Duke. People who go there are just normal people who want to do big things in life. If that makes us douchey, I guess that makes us douchey. Oh well. But people assume it&#x2019;s a bunch of nerds walking around with stacks and stacks of books. Duke&#x2019;s not just academia and basketball, though. I had a tremendous time in college and most Duke students do.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.n"> <strong>Do you have a good LeBron story that maybe shows us a side we wouldn&#x2019;t expect?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.o"> LeBron&#x2019;s really just a normal guy. He busts on me a lot for being older than the other guys. He&#x2019;ll make fun of my wardrobe and the way I talk. He calls me &quot;Shane Obama&quot;. He&#x2019;s a great teammate, though. What makes him so interesting is that he&#x2019;s really just a big kid. He just so happens to also be the best basketball player in the planet.</p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.p"> <strong>You signed a three-year deal with Miami last off-season. Did even a small part of you consider making a joke about taking your talents down to South Beach?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.4.q"> Nah. That would have been clich&amp;#xC3;&amp;#xA9;. I pride myself on not being a clich&amp;#xC3;&amp;#xA9;. If I would have done that--I mean, really? It&#x2019;s all been done. It all was said. Trust me. By now, I think that&#x2019;s a bit played out.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".8x12fygc8w.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
