  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A This year\u0027s breakout television star is a 65-year-old retired Army veteran with an addiction to unsweetened iced tea and a total disdain for shaving. Silas Merritt Robertson, better know as Uncle Si, is a member of the Robertson family from \u0022Duck Dynasty,\u0022 a bayou-based reality show breaking broadcasting records. The season premiere two weeks ago drew 11.8 million viewers, which made it the most-watched non-fiction telecast in cable history, and a monster hit by any measure. (By comparison, critical darling \u0022Breaking Bad\u0022\u0027s season premiere drew 5.9 million viewers.)\u000A\u000A The Robertsons own the Nielsens as well as the New York Times bestseller list. As of Sunday, family patriarch Phil Robertson\u0027s autobiography \u0022Happy, Happy, Happy\u0022 was number 4, and it\u0027s been on the list for 16 weeks. \u0022Duck Commanders,\u0022 by Phil\u0027s son Willie and his wife, Korie, was at number 11, and has spent 21 weeks on the charts.\u000A\u000A The newest entry in the family publishing juggernaut arrives this week from Uncle Si: \u0022Si-cology 1\u0022 a memoir mid with yarns of varying degrees of veracity, and peppered with Si\u0027s signature tics, aphorisms and malaprops. It ain\u0027t Updike, but it is damn entertaining.Late last week we caught up with Uncle Si, while he was hanging with his nephew Alan Robertson, the newest (and lone clean-shaven) cast member on \u0022Duck Dynasty.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Alan: Incidentally, when I think GQ magazine, I think of Si Robertson.\u000A\u000A Si: Yeah, that suits me to a T, I think!\u000A\u000A GQ: Reading the book and learning about all the different things you\u0027ve done in your life, did you ever think you\u0027d be an author, as well?\u000A\u000A Si: No (laughs). Look, I tried to talk them out of this. They just wouldn\u0027t stop. They wouldn\u0027t leave me alone. They said, \u0022Look, you\u0027ve got to write a book.\u0022 So they finally drove me into it.\u000A\u000A GQ: \u0022Hey!\u0022 has become a catchphrase now. Where did that come from?\u000A\u000A Si: Look, we\u0027ve asked that question, because I asked, \u0022Hey, when did it ever start? When did I start it?\u0022 And nobody knows the answer to it, OK? But I know one thing: Everybody\u0027s saying it. I\u0027ve even got Phil saying it every once in a while. He keeps doing it, and when we tell him, he says, \u0022Naw, I didn\u0027t say it.\u0022 It slips out, OK, because everybody\u0027s saying it. You do it unconsciously.\u000A\u000A GQ: You were in the army for about 25 years and have worked at Duck Commander for over a decade. So I\u0027m guessing you\u0027ve spent most of your life wearing camouflage.\u000A\u000A Si: That is true. In the military it was camouflage for the desert or the winter. And now it\u0027s the duck hunting colors—I think it\u0027s \u0022real tree.\u0022 It\u0027s comfortable. It\u0027s stuff that\u0027s made out of comfortable material, OK, and I\u0027m comfortable in it. They\u0027ve asked me, \u0022Hey, is that all you ever wear?\u0022 When I go out or to an event, I\u0027ll wear blue jeans and a shirt. And sometimes when I go to an event I\u0027ll wear camouflage. It depends what kind of mood I\u0027m in.\u000A\u000A GQ: Do you wear it to church?\u000A\u000A Si: Yeah, I\u0027ve worn it to church before. Camouflage and the other clothes.\u000A\u000A Alan: Si has sort of an Australian-style hat that he likes to wear, and he wears that out a lot to the events that he does. And he had one that Willie signed, so he had to get rid of that because Willie signed it.\u000A\u000A Si: Hey, look, everybody when they saw it, they said, \u0022Did Willie Nelson sign your hat?\u0022 I\u0027d say, \u0022No, that\u0027d be Willie Knucklehead—Robertson, OK?\u0022 We were at an event for the fans and I took my hat off and set it down on the couch, and he signed it. I said, \u0022What are you doing, idiot?\u0022 He said, \u0022Look, I was in the zone, and you just happened to put your hat in my zone.\u0022\u000A\u000A Alan: Now we\u0027re getting ready to sell it on eBay to raise money for charity, so we\u0027re hoping to make a lot of money with Si\u0027s hat signed by Willie.\u000A\u000A Si: Yeah, it\u0027s probably worth more money now.\u000A\u000A GQ: Any beard tips for GQ readers?\u000A\u000A Si: Look, hey, everybody thinks I\u0027m the weirdo in the family. Hey, we just got the weirdo in the family coming on the show this season, OK? The clean-shaven one, OK? He\u0027s the one with all the problems. (Si laughs) \u000A\u000A Alan: It\u0027s terrible when people think you\u0027re weird because of the people you run around with. You know that Si\u0027s beard has two lengths. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve noticed that from the show. His right side is not as long as his left side.\u000A\u000A Si: Hey, my wife asked me about that: \u0022What happened to your beard?\u0022 I said, \u0022What are you talking about?\u0022 She said, \u0022Hey, the right side is shorter than the left.\u0022 I said, \u0022You gotta be kidding me.\u0022 So I went in there and looked, and I combed it out and I said, \u0022I don\u0027t know, that\u0027s just the way it grows.\u0022\u000A\u000A GQ: And it\u0027s not all one color, is it? It\u0027s almost camouflage.\u000A\u000A Si: (laughs) No, it\u0027s multi-colors. That has to do with age.\u000A\u000A GQ: In the book is you say your stories are 95-percent truthful. In one of them you talk about how you would sleepwalk when you were in high school a, and one night your sister and her date came home and opened the door, and you sprinted out in your sleep and got a mile down the street before they could catch you.\u000A\u000A Si: Look here, he was a football player, OK? Look, they\u0027re telling me about this the next day, OK? He caught me about a mile past my cousin\u0027s house. He said, \u0022Good grief!\u0022 He said, \u0022Hey, you can\u0027t be doing that, because look, we had hard practices, but after chasing you down last night, I ain\u0027t never had a practice that hard.\u0022 I was in my tighty-whities and I never woke up, and I ran over a mile.\u000A\u000A GQ: So you were asleep on the way home, too?\u000A\u000A Si: Hey, look, they told me all this happened! And I said, \u0022Get out of here! (laughs) Y\u0027all are making this up.\u0022 Because like I said, my cousin\u0027s house was a mile down the road. And the guy said, \u0022Hey, I ain\u0027t making this up. I\u0027m still sore. My muscles are cramping up right now from it.\u0022\u000A\u000A Alan: My aunt—Si\u0027s sister—told me the same story, so he has been confirmed on that one. That one must be 98-percent true.\u000A\u000A Si: That\u0027s the thing. People say, \u0022Look, your book is about tall tales.\u0022 And I said, \u0022No, you don\u0027t understand, OK? The book is tall tales, OK, by me. But look, those tall tales are my life, OK? And look, I added some spices in there. That\u0027s the five percent. You know the one about the wolves chasing me?\u000A\u000A GQ: Right, when you were lost in the woods in Louisiana and a pack of wolves came after you?\u000A\u000A Si: The only thing about that—they wasn\u0027t wolves, they was coyotes.\u000A\u000A GQ: So the part is true about how you ran from the wolves so fast that your shoes burst into flames?\u000A\u000A Si: (laughs) That\u0027s another part that the fans will have to decide for themselves, OK, because I\u0027m not going to give that away.\u000A\u000A GQ: Another story I thought was funny was about the pigeon you had as a kid.\u000A\u000A Si: Oh, Eagle!\u000A\u000A GQ: Yes, the pigeon named Eagle.\u000A\u000A Si: Hey, look, that was a good pigeon, OK? But look, that was true. I knocked him off the top of a cotton gin with a sailer rock—what we called a sailer rock, it\u0027s flat. And when it hit him, it turned his head 180 degrees, and did not kill him. I don\u0027t know if it broke his neck or not, but it did not kill him. His chest would be looking at you, and his head was looking the opposite direction.\u000A\u000A GQ: How long did he live like that?\u000A\u000A Si: Hey, look, I guess he died of old age, because I remember having him. You would throw him up in the air and he would fly down into the ground. Because he was looking up. But it\u0027s true. That is true.\u000A\u000A GQ: That\u0027s amazing. And then your neighbor\u0027s cats attacked your pigeons?\u000A\u000A Si: Hey, look here, twenty-five pigeons in that pigeon coop, and look, they killed twenty-four of them. I guess they were scared to mess with Eagle because he was kind of weird. But he was the only one who survived that massacre.\u000A\u000A GQ: it seemed like you and brothers and sisters had a lot of adventures as kids, and you really lived off the land.\u000A\u000A Si: We were actually in the 1950s, OK, but it was like we was living back in the 1850s. We lived in log cabin. Daddy had a farm—cows, pigs, OK, a big garden, OK? We did live off the land, and then we would supplement all that with whatever we could kill or catch. Whether we\u0027d kill squirrels, deer, duck, or caught catfish or brim, that was what went on the table. We killed our own hogs, we killed our own beef, we raised our own vegetables, which Mama canned. We did live off the land.\u000A\u000A GQ: I know today there are people who are against hunting, but you see on the show and in the book, there\u0027s an element of sport, but with you guys there\u0027s also nothing that goes to waste.\u000A\u000A Si: Look, my father, OK, when we first got old enough to hunt, this was his rule: If you shoot it, you come home and eat it. Otherwise you do not shoot it, OK? You don\u0027t just kill something for the sake of killing it, OK? If you kill it, you gotta grill it, so to speak.\u000A\u000A GQ: In the book was you say you think taking naps should be the national pastime. Now that you\u0027re famous, maybe you can lobby Congress or the President about that?\u000A\u000A Si: Look here, they got some people that are saying, hey, elect me as president. Hey, Washington couldn\u0027t handle Si Robertson. Trust me.\u000A\u000A GQ: What would be the first thing you\u0027d change?\u000A\u000A Si: Hey, the first thing I\u0027d do is de-regulate about 90-percent of the things that they\u0027ve got regulation on, OK, including duck hunting. We\u0027re way over-regulated on everything.\u000A\u000A GQ: And then napping would be in there too?\u000A\u000A Si: Yep. Hey, look, nap time would become a national pastime. A man needs his beauty rest!\u000A\u000A GQ: I have to ask, what\u0027s your recipe for iced tea?\u000A\u000A Si: Look here: You get three family packs of tea, OK, your choice. You put it in about a quart of water, OK, and put it in a microwave for six minutes. Then you let it sit for like twenty minutes, OK, to steep. And then put it in a gallon of water. Hey, then, you carry it everywhere you go, OK? I\u0027m like a fine-tuned race car. You\u0027ve got to make frequent pit stops when you drink as much tea as I do.\u000A\u000A GQ: So you don\u0027t drink sweet tea?\u000A\u000A Si: No, unsweet. People don\u0027t realize where unsweet tea came from. During the war they had to ration sugar, so then everybody just had to drink bitter tea, or unsweet.\u000A\u000A GQ: We see you carrying around your big jug of tea on TV. You don\u0027t have any ice in there?\u000A\u000A Si: Nope. No, ice will ruin the tea. Waters it down. You can always get ice, or carry your ice in an ice container. You don\u0027t want to put it in your tea, it\u0027ll water it down.\u000A\u000A GQ: I\u0027m going to use to use this recipe. I think it sounds better than your Vietnam Special that you cooked for all the guys in the RV and ruined their stomachs.\u000A\u000A Si: Hey, look, I messed up on the Vietnam Special, because I gave it to civilians, OK? Only military men can handle that.\u000A\u000A GQ: Yeah, I saw on the show.\u000A\u000A Si: (laughs) A lot of dietary gastro-ology.",

breakout television star is a 65-year-old retired Army veteran with an addiction to unsweetened iced tea and a total disdain for shaving. Silas Merritt Robertson, better know as Uncle Si, is a member of the Robertson family from &quot;Duck Dynasty,&quot; a bayou-based reality show breaking broadcasting records. The season premiere two weeks ago drew 11.8 million viewers, which made it the most-watched non-fiction telecast in cable history, and a monster hit by any measure. (By comparison, critical darling &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;&apos;s season premiere drew 5.9 million viewers.)</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.2"> The Robertsons own the Nielsens as well as the New York Times bestseller list. As of Sunday, family patriarch Phil Robertson&apos;s autobiography &quot;Happy, Happy, Happy&quot; was number 4, and it&apos;s been on the list for 16 weeks. &quot;Duck Commanders,&quot; by Phil&apos;s son Willie and his wife, Korie, was at number 11, and has spent 21 weeks on the charts.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.3"> The newest entry in the family publishing juggernaut arrives this week from Uncle Si: &quot;Si-cology 1&quot; a memoir mid with yarns of varying degrees of veracity, and peppered with Si&apos;s signature tics, aphorisms and malaprops. It ain&apos;t Updike, but it is damn entertaining.Late last week we caught up with Uncle Si, while he was hanging with his nephew Alan Robertson, the newest (and lone clean-shaven) cast member on &quot;Duck Dynasty.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.5">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.6"> <strong>Alan:</strong> Incidentally, when I think <em>GQ</em> magazine, I think of Si Robertson.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>Si:</strong> Yeah, that suits me to a T, I think!</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.8"> <strong>GQ: Reading the book and learning about all the different things you&apos;ve done in your life, did you ever think you&apos;d be an author, as well?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.9"> <strong>Si:</strong> No (laughs). Look, I tried to talk them out of this. They just wouldn&apos;t stop. They wouldn&apos;t leave me alone. They said, &quot;Look, you&apos;ve got to write a book.&quot; So they finally drove me into it.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.a"> <strong>GQ: &quot;Hey!&quot; has become a catchphrase now. Where did that come from?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.b"> <strong>Si:</strong> Look, we&apos;ve asked that question, because I asked, &quot;Hey, when did it ever start? When did I start it?&quot; And nobody knows the answer to it, OK? But I know one thing: Everybody&apos;s saying it. I&apos;ve even got Phil saying it every once in a while. He keeps doing it, and when we tell him, he says, &quot;Naw, I didn&apos;t say it.&quot; It slips out, OK, because everybody&apos;s saying it. You do it unconsciously.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.c"> <strong>GQ: You were in the army for about 25 years and have worked at Duck Commander for over a decade. So I&apos;m guessing you&apos;ve spent most of your life wearing camouflage.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.d"> <strong>Si:</strong> That is true. In the military it was camouflage for the desert or the winter. And now it&apos;s the duck hunting colors&#x2014;I think it&apos;s &quot;real tree.&quot; It&apos;s comfortable. It&apos;s stuff that&apos;s made out of comfortable material, OK, and I&apos;m comfortable in it. They&apos;ve asked me, &quot;Hey, is that all you ever wear?&quot; When I go out or to an event, I&apos;ll wear blue jeans and a shirt. And sometimes when I go to an event I&apos;ll wear camouflage. It depends what kind of mood I&apos;m in.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.e"> <strong>GQ: Do you wear it to church?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.f"> <strong>Si:</strong> Yeah, I&apos;ve worn it to church before. Camouflage and the other clothes.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.g"> <strong>Alan:</strong> Si has sort of an Australian-style hat that he likes to wear, and he wears that out a lot to the events that he does. And he had one that Willie signed, so he had to get rid of that because Willie signed it.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.h"> <strong>Si:</strong> Hey, look, everybody when they saw it, they said, &quot;Did Willie Nelson sign your hat?&quot; I&apos;d say, &quot;No, that&apos;d be Willie Knucklehead&#x2014;Robertson, OK?&quot; We were at an event for the fans and I took my hat off and set it down on the couch, and he signed it. I said, &quot;What are you doing, idiot?&quot; He said, &quot;Look, I was in the zone, and you just happened to put your hat in my zone.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.i"> <strong>Alan:</strong> Now we&apos;re getting ready to sell it on eBay to raise money for charity, so we&apos;re hoping to make a lot of money with Si&apos;s hat signed by Willie.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.j"> <strong>Si:</strong> Yeah, it&apos;s probably worth more money now.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.k"> <strong>GQ: Any beard tips for GQ readers?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.l"> <strong>Si:</strong> Look, hey, everybody thinks I&apos;m the weirdo in the family. Hey, we just got the weirdo in the family coming on the show this season, OK? The clean-shaven one, OK? He&apos;s the one with all the problems. <em>(Si laughs) </em></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.m"> <strong>Alan:</strong> It&apos;s terrible when people think you&apos;re weird because of the people you run around with. You know that Si&apos;s beard has two lengths. I don&apos;t know if you&apos;ve noticed that from the show. His right side is not as long as his left side.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.n"> <strong>Si:</strong> Hey, my wife asked me about that: &quot;What happened to your beard?&quot; I said, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; She said, &quot;Hey, the right side is shorter than the left.&quot; I said, &quot;You gotta be kidding me.&quot; So I went in there and looked, and I combed it out and I said, &quot;I don&apos;t know, that&apos;s just the way it grows.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.o"> <strong>GQ: And it&apos;s not all one color, is it? It&apos;s almost camouflage.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.p"> <strong>Si:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em> No, it&apos;s multi-colors. That has to do with age.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.q"> <strong>GQ:</strong> In the book is you say your stories are 95-percent truthful. In one of them you talk about how you would sleepwalk when you were in high school a, and one night your sister and her date came home and opened the door, and you sprinted out in your sleep and got a mile down the street before they could catch you.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.r"> <strong>Si:</strong> Look here, he was a football player, OK? Look, they&apos;re telling me about this the next day, OK? He caught me about a mile past my cousin&apos;s house. He said, &quot;Good grief!&quot; He said, &quot;Hey, you can&apos;t be doing that, because look, we had hard practices, but after chasing you down last night, I ain&apos;t never had a practice that hard.&quot; I was in my tighty-whities and I never woke up, and I ran over a mile.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.s"> <strong>GQ: So you were asleep on the way home, too?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.t"> <strong>Si:</strong> Hey, look, they told me all this happened! And I said, &quot;Get out of here! <em>(laughs)</em> Y&apos;all are making this up.&quot; Because like I said, my cousin&apos;s house was a mile down the road. And the guy said, &quot;Hey, I ain&apos;t making this up. I&apos;m still sore. My muscles are cramping up right now from it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.u"> <strong>Alan:</strong> My aunt&#x2014;Si&apos;s sister&#x2014;told me the same story, so he has been confirmed on that one. That one must be 98-percent true.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.v"> <strong>Si:</strong> That&apos;s the thing. People say, &quot;Look, your book is about tall tales.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, you don&apos;t understand, OK? The book is tall tales, OK, by me. But look, those tall tales are my life, OK? And look, I added some spices in there. That&apos;s the five percent. You know the one about the wolves chasing me?</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.w"> <strong>GQ: Right, when you were lost in the woods in Louisiana and a pack of wolves came after you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.x"> <strong>Si:</strong> The only thing about that&#x2014;they wasn&apos;t wolves, they was coyotes.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.y"> <strong>GQ: So the part is true about how you ran from the wolves so fast that your shoes burst into flames?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.z"> <strong>Si:</strong> <em>(laughs)</em> That&apos;s another part that the fans will have to decide for themselves, OK, because I&apos;m not going to give that away.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.10"> <strong>GQ: Another story I thought was funny was about the pigeon you had as a kid.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.11"> <strong>Si:</strong> Oh, Eagle!</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.12"> <strong>GQ: Yes, the pigeon named Eagle.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.13"> <strong>Si:</strong> Hey, look, that was a good pigeon, OK? But look, that was true. I knocked him off the top of a cotton gin with a sailer rock&#x2014;what we called a sailer rock, it&apos;s flat. And when it hit him, it turned his head 180 degrees, and did not kill him. I don&apos;t know if it broke his neck or not, but it did not kill him. His chest would be looking at you, and his head was looking the opposite direction.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.14"> <strong>GQ: How long did he live like that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.15"> <strong>Si:</strong> Hey, look, I guess he died of old age, because I remember having him. You would throw him up in the air and he would fly down into the ground. Because he was looking up. But it&apos;s true. That is true.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.16"> <strong>GQ: That&apos;s amazing. And then your neighbor&apos;s cats attacked your pigeons?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.17"> <strong>Si:</strong> Hey, look here, twenty-five pigeons in that pigeon coop, and look, they killed twenty-four of them. I guess they were scared to mess with Eagle because he was kind of weird. But he was the only one who survived that massacre.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.18"> <strong>GQ: it seemed like you and brothers and sisters had a lot of adventures as kids, and you really lived off the land.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.19"> <strong>Si:</strong> We were actually in the 1950s, OK, but it was like we was living back in the 1850s. We lived in log cabin. Daddy had a farm&#x2014;cows, pigs, OK, a big garden, OK? We did live off the land, and then we would supplement all that with whatever we could kill or catch. Whether we&apos;d kill squirrels, deer, duck, or caught catfish or brim, that was what went on the table. We killed our own hogs, we killed our own beef, we raised our own vegetables, which Mama canned. We did live off the land.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> <strong>GQ: I know today there are people who are against hunting, but you see on the show and in the book, there&apos;s an element of sport, but with you guys there&apos;s also nothing that goes to waste.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> <strong>Si:</strong> Look, my father, OK, when we first got old enough to hunt, this was his rule: If you shoot it, you come home and eat it. Otherwise you do not shoot it, OK? You don&apos;t just kill something for the sake of killing it, OK? If you kill it, you gotta grill it, so to speak.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> <strong>GQ: In the book was you say you think taking naps should be the national pastime. Now that you&apos;re famous, maybe you can lobby Congress or the President about that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> <strong>Si:</strong> Look here, they got some people that are saying, hey, elect me as president. Hey, Washington couldn&apos;t handle Si Robertson. Trust me.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> <strong>GQ: What would be the first thing you&apos;d change?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> <strong>Si:</strong> Hey, the first thing I&apos;d do is de-regulate about 90-percent of the things that they&apos;ve got regulation on, OK, including duck hunting. We&apos;re way over-regulated on everything.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> <strong>GQ: And then napping would be in there too?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1h"> <strong>Si:</strong> Yep. Hey, look, nap time would become a national pastime. A man needs his beauty rest!</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1i"> <strong>GQ: I have to ask, what&apos;s your recipe for iced tea?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1j"> <strong>Si:</strong> Look here: You get three family packs of tea, OK, your choice. You put it in about a quart of water, OK, and put it in a microwave for six minutes. Then you let it sit for like twenty minutes, OK, to steep. And then put it in a gallon of water. Hey, then, you carry it everywhere you go, OK? I&apos;m like a fine-tuned race car. You&apos;ve got to make frequent pit stops when you drink as much tea as I do.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1k"> <strong>GQ: So you don&apos;t drink sweet tea?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1l"> <strong>Si:</strong> No, unsweet. People don&apos;t realize where unsweet tea came from. During the war they had to ration sugar, so then everybody just had to drink bitter tea, or unsweet.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1m"> <strong>GQ: We see you carrying around your big jug of tea on TV. You don&apos;t have any ice in there?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1n"> <strong>Si:</strong> Nope. No, ice will ruin the tea. Waters it down. You can always get ice, or carry your ice in an ice container. You don&apos;t want to put it in your tea, it&apos;ll water it down.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1o"> <strong>GQ: I&apos;m going to use to use this recipe. I think it sounds better than your Vietnam Special that you cooked for all the guys in the RV and ruined their stomachs.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1p"> <strong>Si:</strong> Hey, look, I messed up on the Vietnam Special, because I gave it to civilians, OK? Only military men can handle that.</p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1q"> <strong>GQ: Yeah, I saw on the show.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".pktmxl8gsg.1.1.0.0.4.1r"> <strong>Si:
