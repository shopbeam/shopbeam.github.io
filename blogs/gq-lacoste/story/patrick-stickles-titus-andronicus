  	    "articleBody": "The common narrative about Titus Andronicus, the one that lead singer and sole songwriter Patrick Stickles can\u0027t stand, is as follows: his bedroom-project punk-rock band rolled out of northern New Jersey in 2008 with their sometimes-sloppy, never-less-than-grandiose debut The Airing of Grievances, followed by Civil-War-as-extended-metaphor-for-Stickles\u0027-life The Monitor in 2010. They were anointed the torchbearers of a certain kind of emotionally honest and raw rock n\u0027 roll, at the core of a fertile Brooklyn-based DIY punk scene; and Stickles was viewed as a megalomaniacal tyrant who couldn\u0027t keep together a steady lineup for more than a year. If you saw a live show, there\u0027d always be some rocking going on, but on stage would be Stickles and whichever four other likeminded but wasted losers he could pull together for a tour (or for that particular concert). Overburdened with the crown he\u0027d been given, Stickles scaled back on2012\u0027s Local Business, assembling a collection of simpler and more straightforward songs, and in doing so lost his way. Now, with the release of the twenty-nine song The Most Lamentable Tragedy, a rock opera told in five parts and centered on his struggles with manic-depression, Stickles has made a triumphant return to the kind of ambition that drew such a fervent fan base from day one.\u000A\u000AThe thing about that narrative? It\u0027s bullshit. And Stickles is here to tell you why.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: Where are you right now?Patrick Stickles: Not to lay the ground for any kind of extended metaphor, but I happen to be walking down a street that bisects Brooklyn and Queens. I live in Ridgewood, Queens. Brooklyn represented a past, a time in my life that I cling to, maybe a little more than is healthy or good for me as a person or an artist. \u0027Cause whatever happened in the Brooklyn DIY scene back in the late aughts might as well be a hundred years ago. Meanwhile, Queens is the most diverse municipality in the entire world, a place for everybody no matter what your past is, where you\u0027re coming from. A quieter, simpler life, a life that\u0027s more about hard work and real values. Taking care of the people you love and trying to just be a good person, not the best in the world, but just as decent as you can be. So as I walk this street, I can\u0027t help but think about how I\u0027m forced to walk this line in my life, being near 30 years old now. Literally and figuratively, I\u0027m walking the line between Queens and Brooklyn.\u000A\u000AWhat do you still cling to about that DIY scene?It was an inviting, inclusive, immersive clubhouse that had all these different dispersed rooms across the city. In my mind\u0027s eye, I can almost see the New York scene back then, when Death By Audio and the Silent Barn and Monster Island the dozens of other venues—you can almost imagine them as like individual rooms in a great mansion. People were doing their work without unnecessary interference from the system.\u000A\u000AWhat do you mean by \u0022unnecessary interference\u0022?There wasn\u0027t a minor league mentality that you find amongst young bands now, who are just waiting to get the call and to be curated into relevancy. That\u0027s nothing against young people, that\u0027s just how the system works now. My band takes what strength we have and use it to not pull ourselves up some imaginary ladder to some fucking imaginary heaven where it\u0027s it 1998 again and you can still sell a million CDs. If you\u0027re a rock and roll band, like you\u0027re fucking Everclear, who I love very much, what the hell is the point? They used their strength to get up that imaginary ladder. We want to give our strength back to the people that make up the community that nurtured us, and that\u0027s still sort of alive. There\u0027s too many fucking jokers and too many people taking the artist\u0027s life as a fucking game to be played and won, rather than the fucking blessing it is.\u000A\u000AWho\u0027s now occupying New York\u0027s metaphorical mansion?A lot of good-hearted people that probably really love music, and love the feeling of seeing it performed live, and I shouldn\u0027t condescend to young people. This is what old people always say, right? \u0022The kids are stupid and me and my friends were smart. There were a thousand good bands back then and there\u0027s none now.\u0022 Everybody that said that when I was the young guy was a moron. So maybe I\u0027m a fucking moron, but it seems to me like everything else in society, it\u0027s just becoming more and more homogenized, more and more of a fucking advertisement. And in New York City, you can\u0027t even step onto the subway without walking into a fucking commercial. I moved to New York City cause I wanted to live amongst the dense clamor of sights and sounds. I wanted to live among the fucking din and clutter that makes a space for every fucking human on the planet. No matter how fucking crazy they are. And that\u0027s going away, and it\u0027s turning into a fucking bank.\u000A\u000AWhy do you stay here?I stay in New York cause I want to prove to everybody that I\u0027m the best in the world. And I want to wear the crown that sat on the head of the Notorious B.I.G. I\u0027m living here cause I\u0027m one of the best lyricists in this town. I want to be number one in that game. Because I\u0027m still in the jungle, I\u0027m still an animal in my head. We all are. So I have that drive. It seems to me that\u0027s the purpose of my life. I could get a cheaper life in Philadelphia, but being the best lyricist in Philadelphia is something different. I grew up in the shadow of the colossus. So if I make it here, I\u0027m the real deal. That\u0027s the game that I play with myself. But it got me this far.\u000A\u000AEach of your albums has raised your band\u0027s profile. Where do you think this one will take you?Let\u0027s say, god forbid, that everybody loves it, and it brought us up to the level of, I don\u0027t know, let\u0027s just say The War on Drugs, alright? Since they won last year: the contemporary contest for rock and roll supremacy not dominated by, like, Three Doors Down or whoever\u0027s still kicking. Let\u0027s say if this record were to take us to where The War on Drugs found themselves at the end of last year. You\u0027d think, Well, you did it. Your problems are over, right? You\u0027d think that I would be satisfied, but no. Then I would say the kind of shit that all these people\u0027s managers are telling them now, you know, which is that now you can be fucking Bruce Springsteen. Now you can be the fucking Black Keys. I\u0027m sure there are people out there pontificating and imagining if The War on Drugs could take the leap to the logical next level and be I don\u0027t know, Phoenix or something. Whoever it is—The Strokes. Whoever can still fill the Garden.\u000A\u000AIs that the kind of success you want? Do you think it\u0027s even possible for a band like yours?Even The War on Drugs, they\u0027re never gonna sell out the fucking Garden. Everybody that would ever like The War on Drugs has got the CD. But that\u0027s why it was a success. And this is the one great thing that the Internet has done for the artist: there are so few barriers now between the artist and the potential audience. Like I said before, these communities of likeminded people have always been dispersed amongst the provinces and had no connectivity. When I came and found the people in the New York DIY scene, our shared history was through MTV and the pages of Spin magazine, and Green Day and Weezer and Wu Tang Clan. Obviously, those kinds of tent-pole artists are likely never gonna exist anymore. Like, even Arcade Fire can barely fucking go platinum. It\u0027s tough. But the Internet has made it such that whatever your specific tastes are, chances are it\u0027s not that hard for you to connect with many thousands of people who have exceedingly similar taste. They\u0027re able to forge communities around artists like The War on Drugs or even Titus Andronicus, that are never gonna have number one hits, that\u0027ll never build a consensus \u0027cause they\u0027re too weird. But there\u0027re so many people in the world, and so many of \u0027em can use the Internet and have fucking ears and headphones – if you\u0027re doing something real and you\u0027re doing something that\u0027s as original as rock and roll can get and you know how to use the fucking Internet, then there\u0027s not real reason why, with time, you can\u0027t create a community that\u0027s gonna support you.\u000A\u000AHow did you take the reaction to Local Business ?Someone in your position says, their third album didn\u0027t do so good, he\u0027s probably been starving, and to a certain extent that\u0027s true, but to a greater and more important extent, it\u0027s not, because if our days as a buzz band are gone with the New York DIY scene of that time, what\u0027s not gone are the people with whom we made a genuine connection. And these past three years while everybody else was laughing at us, these people were supporting us. Maybe it didn\u0027t make headlines, but our music has been reaching people this whole time, and if we\u0027ve gotten less popular in a lot of people\u0027s eyes, it sure is weird that our concerts only got better and better attended. This is the two oh one five, and I know how to use the fucking internet and I got something to say.\u000A\u000ASounds like you have a chip on your shoulder.I have a chip on my shoulder about critics, yes, but I know in my heart of hearts that Local Business was every single bit as ambitious as the previous one. I wanted to make a proper fucking Neil Young, Rolling Stones, real deal rock album. And maybe we stumbled a little bit in doing that, but we were trying something different and we were trying to do something a lot fucking harder than making an elaborate fantasia to dazzle the fucking listener with how clever we are, like we did on our first two records, no offense to us. People think that that record is fucking lazy compared to The Monitor, and they\u0027ve obviously never spent any time with it in any kind of substantive way beyond asking, How does this fit into my narrative about how they\u0027ve changed and now they suck? You know, they\u0027ve never fucking sat down with the fucking words. They\u0027ve never investigated any of the fucking stuff behind the songs. They\u0027ve never looked for the fucking themes that tie it together. Sorry they don\u0027t smack you in the fucking face! You know, but they\u0027re there. Basically, I\u0027m done getting pushed around by the fucking media. And I\u0027m not gonna let the media put up a wall between me and the people who I wanna have a fucking impact on. People that I want to help. I\u0027m trying to reach out to people about shit that\u0027s fucking hard for me, because music and art show me that if something\u0027s hard for you, there\u0027s somebody else in the world that it\u0027s hard for just like that. And plenty of fucking musician angels came out of the expansive, endless sky that is rock history to remind me of that. That\u0027s the mission that I\u0027m on, and we never stopped doing it, we never fucking faltered in that, I can promise you. I definitely didn\u0027t sit around saying, What if fucking Pitchfork doesn\u0027t like this one, too? I\u0027ve sat around thinking, You know, maybe I\u0027ll move to the fucking desert. Maybe I\u0027ll become a truck driver. I\u0027ve thought about those things, those fucking realities of life in this fucked up game. But I don\u0027t sit down with a guitar and say, Let\u0027s please the people that spend their life tapping away on the Internet. No offense. I think about what\u0027s really going on with me, what\u0027s the scariest thing for me to say. Let me say it so that somebody else can fucking hear it and know that they\u0027re not completely alone in the universe and the world\u0027s biggest freak, like I thought I was for the first fucking 30 to 40 to fucking 90% of my life.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re a good talker.Oh, well, thank you very much, but the sad fucking sick fact about it is that I\u0027m only really like this three, maybe four months out of the year. Pretty soon I\u0027m gonna be deadhead again. It\u0027s cyclical, because I\u0027m a manic-depressive and that\u0027s the nature of our species.\u000A\u000ASo what is this album all about?My art is my way of talking to myself and trying to fucking grow up. With this rock opera, I was trying to say to myself something that I\u0027ve been terrified to say for a long fucking time. Which is that I\u0027m a manic-depressive and there\u0027s no fucking escape. It\u0027s not something that\u0027s gonna get wiped off, it\u0027s that fucking essential part of myself. My brain is manic-depressive and that\u0027s the way it is, same fucking way the sky is blue. And that is fucking fine, you know what I mean? Because there\u0027s just a lot of critters in the forest. I\u0027m scared and confused and lost as the next fucking person. The other moral of the rock opera is: your bullshit is your bullshit. Keep it your bullshit. When you start to make it somebody else\u0027s problem and you use it as an excuse to hurt people, you know, because poor you, you\u0027ve had such a hard life. Well, fuck you. And you deserve to fucking lose everything. That\u0027s not the same as not asking for help. But don\u0027t be a fucking baby and make 100,000 self-destructive choices that turn you into an asshole because you don\u0027t want to talk about one thing in your life that scares you. And so that\u0027s why I wrote the fucking rock opera is to tell myself that. This record\u0027s about validating myself and saying that my nature is my nature, but that\u0027s not anybody else\u0027s problem. In the rock opera, the main character basically tries to make it the other person\u0027s problem. Take my burden. You know what I\u0027m saying? Let me show you my fatal flaw, like it\u0027s fucking a good idea. Ultimately the moral of the story is your nature can be your nature and maybe you can work it out. But if you use it as a fucking excuse to hurt people, you\u0027re always gonna fucking be alone.\u000A\u000ANow that the album is written and recorded and out there in the world, how do you feel?I just want to be a decent guy. Even though I said all this stuff about wanting to be the greatest in the world, I\u0027d be happy to just be the lyricist in Queens. Everything I have is good enough. Like, the truth is that I\u0027ve got everything I ever wanted. I\u0027m a really lucky, blessed guy. And all the fucking anxiety I have, you know, all the suffering I do, just like Buddha warned, comes from attachment and the selfish desire to make all of it last forever. And if I didn\u0027t spend so much of my life saying, Oh, but what if it all went away tomorrow? What if the Internet changes its mind? What if I hit the wall and have a major depressive episode? You know? What if I blow my whole life up \u0027cause I\u0027m crazy? All these woes and these worries, you can\u0027t just totally push them into the shadows of the closet. You have to validate them, but I\u0027ve spent so much of my life wallowing in them until they were a reality. Wallowing in them until I was drowning in them. Why keep doing it? I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m trying to stop and I keep writing records to teach myself how to do it. I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not that fucking simple. You have to actually talk about this shit with the people you love. Sorry that it\u0027s scarier than yelling into a fucking microphone over a band that\u0027s pushing 120 decibels.",

data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.3"></h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.0">The common narrative about Titus Andronicus, the one that lead singer and sole songwriter Patrick Stickles can&apos;t stand, is as follows: his bedroom-project punk-rock band rolled out of northern New Jersey in 2008 with their sometimes-sloppy, never-less-than-grandiose debut <em>The Airing of Grievances</em>, followed by Civil-War-as-extended-metaphor-for-Stickles&apos;-life <em>The Monitor </em>in 2010. They were anointed the torchbearers of a certain kind of emotionally honest and raw rock n&apos; roll, at the core of a fertile Brooklyn-based DIY punk scene; and Stickles was viewed as a megalomaniacal tyrant who couldn&apos;t keep together a steady lineup for more than a year. If you saw a live show, there&apos;d always be some rocking going on, but on stage would be Stickles and whichever four other likeminded but wasted losers he could pull together for a tour (or for that particular concert). Overburdened with the crown he&apos;d been given, Stickles scaled back on2012&apos;s<em> Local Business</em>, assembling a collection of simpler and more straightforward songs, and in doing so lost his way. Now, with the release of the twenty-nine song <em>The Most Lamentable Tragedy</em>, a rock opera told in five parts and centered on his struggles with manic-depression, Stickles has made a triumphant return to the kind of ambition that drew such a fervent fan base from day one.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.1">The thing about that narrative? It&apos;s bullshit. And Stickles is here to tell you why.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.2"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>GQ: Where are you right now?</strong><br>Patrick Stickles: Not to lay the ground for any kind of extended metaphor, but I happen to be walking down a street that bisects Brooklyn and Queens. I live in Ridgewood, Queens. Brooklyn represented a past, a time in my life that I cling to, maybe a little more than is healthy or good for me as a person or an artist. &apos;Cause whatever happened in the Brooklyn DIY scene back in the late aughts might as well be a hundred years ago. Meanwhile, Queens is the most diverse municipality in the entire world, a place for everybody no matter what your past is, where you&apos;re coming from. A quieter, simpler life, a life that&apos;s more about hard work and real values. Taking care of the people you love and trying to just be a good person, not the best in the world, but just as decent as you can be. So as I walk this street, I can&apos;t help but think about how I&apos;m forced to walk this line in my life, being near 30 years old now. Literally and figuratively, I&apos;m walking the line between Queens and Brooklyn.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>What do you still cling to about that DIY scene?</strong><br>It was an inviting, inclusive, immersive clubhouse that had all these different dispersed rooms across the city. In my mind&apos;s eye, I can almost see the New York scene back then, when Death By Audio and the Silent Barn and Monster Island the dozens of other venues&#x2014;you can almost imagine them as like individual rooms in a great mansion. People were doing their work without unnecessary interference from the system.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>What do you mean by &quot;unnecessary interference&quot;?</strong><br>There wasn&apos;t a minor league mentality that you find amongst young bands now, who are just waiting to get the call and to be curated into relevancy. That&apos;s nothing against young people, that&apos;s just how the system works now. My band takes what strength we have and use it to not pull ourselves up some imaginary ladder to some fucking imaginary heaven where it&apos;s it 1998 again and you can still sell a million CDs. If you&apos;re a rock and roll band, like you&apos;re fucking Everclear, who I love very much, what the hell is the point? They used their strength to get up that imaginary ladder. We want to give our strength back to the people that make up the community that nurtured us, and that&apos;s still sort of alive. There&apos;s too many fucking jokers and too many people taking the artist&apos;s life as a fucking game to be played and won, rather than the fucking blessing it is.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Who&apos;s now occupying New York&apos;s metaphorical mansion?</strong><br>A lot of good-hearted people that probably really love music, and love the feeling of seeing it performed live, and I shouldn&apos;t condescend to young people. This is what old people always say, right? &quot;The kids are stupid and me and my friends were smart. There were a thousand good bands back then and there&apos;s none now.&quot; Everybody that said that when I was the young guy was a moron. So maybe I&apos;m a fucking moron, but it seems to me like everything else in society, it&apos;s just becoming more and more homogenized, more and more of a fucking advertisement. And in New York City, you can&apos;t even step onto the subway without walking into a fucking commercial. I moved to New York City cause I wanted to live amongst the dense clamor of sights and sounds. I wanted to live among the fucking din and clutter that makes a space for every fucking human on the planet. No matter how fucking crazy they are. And that&apos;s going away, and it&apos;s turning into a fucking bank.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Why do you stay here?</strong><br>I stay in New York cause I want to prove to everybody that I&apos;m the best in the world. And I want to wear the crown that sat on the head of the Notorious B.I.G. I&apos;m living here cause I&apos;m one of the best lyricists in this town. I want to be number one in that game. Because I&apos;m still in the jungle, I&apos;m still an animal in my head. We all are. So I have that drive. It seems to me that&apos;s the purpose of my life. I could get a cheaper life in Philadelphia, but being the best lyricist in Philadelphia is something different. I grew up in the shadow of the colossus. So if I make it here, I&apos;m the real deal. That&apos;s the game that I play with myself. But it got me this far.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>Each of your albums has raised your band&apos;s profile. Where do you think this one will take you?</strong><br>Let&apos;s say, god forbid, that everybody loves it, and it brought us up to the level of, I don&apos;t know, let&apos;s just say The War on Drugs, alright? Since they won last year: the contemporary contest for rock and roll supremacy not dominated by, like, Three Doors Down or whoever&apos;s still kicking. Let&apos;s say if this record were to take us to where The War on Drugs found themselves at the end of last year. You&apos;d think, <em>Well, you did it. Your problems are over, right?</em> You&apos;d think that I would be satisfied, but no. Then I would say the kind of shit that all these people&apos;s managers are telling them now, you know, which is that now you can be fucking Bruce Springsteen. Now you can be the fucking Black Keys. I&apos;m sure there are people out there pontificating and imagining if The War on Drugs could take the leap to the logical next level and be I don&apos;t know, Phoenix or something. Whoever it is&#x2014;The Strokes. Whoever can still fill the Garden.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Is that the kind of success you want? Do you think it&apos;s even possible for a band like yours?</strong><br>Even The War on Drugs, they&apos;re never gonna sell out the fucking Garden. Everybody that would ever like The War on Drugs has got the CD. But that&apos;s why it was a success. And this is the one great thing that the Internet has done for the artist: there are so few barriers now between the artist and the potential audience. Like I said before, these communities of likeminded people have always been dispersed amongst the provinces and had no connectivity. When I came and found the people in the New York DIY scene, our shared history was through MTV and the pages of Spin magazine, and Green Day and Weezer and Wu Tang Clan. Obviously, those kinds of tent-pole artists are likely never gonna exist anymore. Like, even Arcade Fire can barely fucking go platinum. It&apos;s tough. But the Internet has made it such that whatever your specific tastes are, chances are it&apos;s not that hard for you to connect with many thousands of people who have exceedingly similar taste. They&apos;re able to forge communities around artists like The War on Drugs or even Titus Andronicus, that are never gonna have number one hits, that&apos;ll never build a consensus &apos;cause they&apos;re too weird. But there&apos;re so many people in the world, and so many of &apos;em can use the Internet and have fucking ears and headphones &#x2013; if you&apos;re doing something real and you&apos;re doing something that&apos;s as original as rock and roll can get and you know how to use the fucking Internet, then there&apos;s not real reason why, with time, you can&apos;t create a community that&apos;s gonna support you.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>How did you take the reaction to</strong><strong> Local Business </strong><strong>?</strong><br>Someone in your position says, <em>their third album didn&apos;t do so good, he&apos;s probably been starving, </em>and to a certain extent that&apos;s true, but to a greater and more important extent, it&apos;s not, because if our days as a buzz band are gone with the New York DIY scene of that time, what&apos;s not gone are the people with whom we made a genuine connection. And these past three years while everybody else was laughing at us, these people were supporting us. Maybe it didn&apos;t make headlines, but our music has been reaching people this whole time, and if we&apos;ve gotten less popular in a lot of people&apos;s eyes, it sure is weird that our concerts only got better and better attended. This is the two oh one five, and I know how to use the fucking internet and I got something to say.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Sounds like you have a chip on your shoulder.</strong><br>I have a chip on my shoulder about critics, yes, but I know in my heart of hearts that <em>Local Business</em> was every single bit as ambitious as the previous one. I wanted to make a proper fucking Neil Young, Rolling Stones, real deal rock album. And maybe we stumbled a little bit in doing that, but we were trying something different and we were trying to do something a lot fucking harder than making an elaborate fantasia to dazzle the fucking listener with how clever we are, like we did on our first two records, no offense to us. People think that that record is fucking lazy compared to <em>The Monitor</em>, and they&apos;ve obviously never spent any time with it in any kind of substantive way beyond asking, <em>How does this fit into my narrative about how they&apos;ve changed and now they suck? </em>You know, they&apos;ve never fucking sat down with the fucking words. They&apos;ve never investigated any of the fucking stuff behind the songs. They&apos;ve never looked for the fucking themes that tie it together. Sorry they don&apos;t smack you in the fucking face! You know, but they&apos;re <em>there</em>. Basically, I&apos;m done getting pushed around by the fucking media. And I&apos;m not gonna let the media put up a wall between me and the people who I wanna have a fucking impact on. People that I want to help. I&apos;m trying to reach out to people about shit that&apos;s fucking hard for me, because music and art show me that if something&apos;s hard for you, there&apos;s somebody else in the world that it&apos;s hard for just like that. And plenty of fucking musician angels came out of the expansive, endless sky that is rock history to remind me of that. That&apos;s the mission that I&apos;m on, and we never stopped doing it, we never fucking faltered in that, I can promise you. I definitely didn&apos;t sit around saying, <em>What if fucking Pitchfork doesn&apos;t like this one, too?</em> I&apos;ve sat around thinking, <em>You know, maybe I&apos;ll move to the fucking desert</em>. <em>Maybe I&apos;ll become a truck driver.</em> I&apos;ve thought about those things, those fucking realities of life in this fucked up game. But I don&apos;t sit down with a guitar and say, <em>Let&apos;s please the people that spend their life tapping away on the Internet. </em>No offense. I think about what&apos;s really going on with me, what&apos;s the scariest thing for me to say. Let me say it so that somebody else can fucking hear it and know that they&apos;re not completely alone in the universe and the world&apos;s biggest freak, like I thought I was for the first fucking 30 to 40 to fucking 90% of my life.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>You&apos;re a good talker.</strong><br>Oh, well, thank you very much, but the sad fucking sick fact about it is that I&apos;m only really like this three, maybe four months out of the year. Pretty soon I&apos;m gonna be deadhead again. It&apos;s cyclical, because I&apos;m a manic-depressive and that&apos;s the nature of our species.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>So what is this album all about?</strong><br>My art is my way of talking to myself and trying to fucking grow up. With this rock opera, I was trying to say to myself something that I&apos;ve been terrified to say for a long fucking time. Which is that I&apos;m a manic-depressive and there&apos;s no fucking escape. It&apos;s not something that&apos;s gonna get wiped off, it&apos;s that fucking essential part of myself. My brain is manic-depressive and that&apos;s the way it is, same fucking way the sky is blue. And that is fucking fine, you know what I mean? Because there&apos;s just a lot of critters in the forest. I&apos;m scared and confused and lost as the next fucking person. The other moral of the rock opera is: your bullshit is your bullshit. Keep it your bullshit. When you start to make it somebody else&apos;s problem and you use it as an excuse to hurt people, you know, because poor you, you&apos;ve had such a hard life. Well, fuck you. And you deserve to fucking lose everything. That&apos;s not the same as not asking for help. But don&apos;t be a fucking baby and make 100,000 self-destructive choices that turn you into an asshole because you don&apos;t want to talk about one thing in your life that scares you. And so that&apos;s why I wrote the fucking rock opera is to tell myself that. This record&apos;s about validating myself and saying that my nature is my nature, but that&apos;s not anybody else&apos;s problem. In the rock opera, the main character basically tries to make it the other person&apos;s problem. <em>Take my burden. </em>You know what I&apos;m saying? <em>Let me show you my fatal flaw, </em>like it&apos;s fucking a good idea. Ultimately the moral of the story is your nature can be your nature and maybe you can work it out. But if you use it as a fucking excuse to hurt people, you&apos;re always gonna fucking be alone.</p><p data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Now that the album is written and recorded and out there in the world, how do you feel?</strong><br>I just want to be a decent guy. Even though I said all this stuff about wanting to be the greatest in the world, I&apos;d be happy to just be the lyricist in Queens. Everything I have is good enough. Like, the truth is that I&apos;ve got everything I ever wanted. I&apos;m a really lucky, blessed guy. And all the fucking anxiety I have, you know, all the suffering I do, just like Buddha warned, comes from attachment and the selfish desire to make all of it last forever. And if I didn&apos;t spend so much of my life saying, <em>Oh, but what if it all went away tomorrow? What if the Internet changes its mind? What if I hit the wall and have a major depressive episode? </em>You know? <em>What if I blow my whole life up &apos;cause I&apos;m crazy? </em>All these woes and these worries, you can&apos;t just totally push them into the shadows of the closet. You have to validate them, but I&apos;ve spent so much of my life wallowing in them until they were a reality. Wallowing in them until I was drowning in them. Why keep doing it? I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m trying to stop and I keep writing records to teach myself how to do it. I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s not that fucking simple. You have to actually talk about this shit with the people you love. Sorry that it&apos;s scarier than yelling into a fucking microphone over a band that&apos;s pushing 120 decibels.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".20isrwgdp1c.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
