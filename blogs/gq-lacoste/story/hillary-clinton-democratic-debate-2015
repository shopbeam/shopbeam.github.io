  	    "articleBody": "Let\u0027s face it. Unless Joe Biden made a surprise appearance by parachuting onto the Strip, Honeymoon in Vegas–style, with the Utah chapter of the \u0022Flying Elvises,\u0022, there was no way the first Democratic debate was going to come close to the Trump-fueled spectacle of the previous two Republican ones. And yet, what it lacked in rhetorical fireworks the Democratic debate more than made up for in clarity. After seven horrendous months of declining poll numbers and growing questions about her political talents, on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, Hillary Clinton demonstrated that, barring a major unforeseen development, she\u0027ll be her party\u0027s nominee—in large part because, whatever her weaknesses, she\u0027s still pretty strong, and her four Democratic opponents at the moment are all pretty weak themselves. \u000A\u000AFrom the moment Clinton walked out on the stage, shaking hands with but refusing to even look at Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u0027Malley, it was clear she was just a cut above the rest of the Democratic field in smoothness and in stature. She deftly handled Anderson Cooper\u0027s first question about her many flip-flops—on everything from gay marriage to the Trans-Pacific Partnership—by explaining that she \u0022absorb[s] new information\u0022 and adjusts accordingly. Was she a progressive or a moderate? Cooper pressed, since she\u0027s claimed to be both. In a bit of triangulation her husband would appreciate, she replied that she was \u0022a progressive, but a progressive who likes to get things done.\u0022 No doubt aware of her own vulnerabilities, she managed to get to Sanders\u0027s left on gun control, hitting him for his Senate vote to give gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits, and she even pretended to be to his left on financial reform. And she actually leaned into the inevitable questions about her e-mail, making full use of Kevin McCarthy\u0027s brain-dead admission that the Benghazi Committee was a GOP mission to attack her candidacy. Her declaration that \u0022I\u0027m still standing\u0022 was like a flashback to the late \u002790s, when she and Bill ran circles around their Republican tormentors.\u000A\u000AOf course, it helped that Clinton\u0027s most serious Democratic opponent came to her aid on that particular issue, which, just a few weeks ago, seemed to pose the most serious threat to her candidacy. \u0022The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails,\u0022 Sanders said, in what was undoubtedly the line of the night—but a line that will benefit her more than it will him. Indeed, that line and the debate as a whole showed why—despite his huge crowds and strange but undeniable charisma—Sanders won\u0027t beat Clinton. It\u0027s not just because Americans aren\u0027t ready to elect a socialist as president, as Cooper bluntly informed Sanders in his first question to the Vermont Senator; it\u0027s because Sanders is more interested in focusing on issues and critiquing the media\u0027s lack of focus on those issues than actually defeating the front-runner. \u000A\u000AMartin O\u0027Malley desperately wants to beat Clinton and Sanders, and after making an issue over the dearth of Democratic debates, he seized the moment, enjoying his finest two hours of the campaign to date. After Clinton seemed to put him in his place by reminding him that he\u0027d endorsed her in 2008, he turned the issue around on her by noting that the financial collapse had occurred in the intervening seven years and her refusal to get tougher on big banks and support the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall was reason enough for him to run against her in 2016. It was a strong, competent, by-the-numbers debate performance for O\u0027Malley. But it actually might work against him in the sense that it makes him seem like even more of a standard-issue pol, which, of course, is the worst thing you can be in the current political environment. \u000A\u000AThere\u0027s nothing standard-issue about Lincoln Chafee or Jim Webb; unfortunately for them, the debate revealed that they\u0027re just too weird to be taken seriously. Webb was probably the most interesting guy on the stage. A military hero, acclaimed novelist, and heterodox Democrat who ran for the Senate to protest the Iraq War, his differences with Hillary on foreign policy are as stark and as substantive as Sanders\u0027s are with the front-runner on domestic policy. It would have been nice if he\u0027d spent some time expanding on them. Instead, he mostly grumbled to Cooper about how little speaking time he was getting—so much so that at one point Cooper admonished him that he was wasting time with his complaints. And then there was Chafee, who supplanted James \u0022Who Am I? Why Am I Here?\u0022 Stockdale at the top of the list for most loopy debate performance of the modern era. Whether he was describing himself as \u0022granite\u0022 or admitting that he had no idea what he was voting on when he first arrived in the Senate, Chafee unwittingly made a strong case that, for the second debate, the Democrats should steal a page from the GOP and have a \u0022kids\u0027 table\u0022 debate, so that Chafee can sit there by himself.\u000A\u000AOf course, by the time that second Democratic debate rolls around one month from now in Iowa, we should know if there\u0027ll be another person on that stage. If Biden does ultimately decide to run, he\u0027ll have to get into the race by November in order to make various filing deadlines. But it\u0027s hard to see him jumping in after tonight. The first Democratic debate served as a useful and necessary reality check. For all of Hillary Clinton\u0027s problems, the race for the Democratic nomination still looks very much like it did back when she was riding high: It remains hers to lose; on Tuesday night she gave every indication that she won\u0027t.\u000A\u000AJason Zengerle is GQ\u0027s Political Correspondent",

Too focused on issues to screw around with trying to win</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".15vy131mbcw.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".15vy131mbcw.1.1.0.0.4.0">Let&#x2019;s face it. Unless Joe Biden made a surprise appearance by parachuting onto the Strip, <em>Honeymoon in Vegas</em>&#x2013;style, with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JbBVKQDTWQ">Utah chapter of the &#x201C;Flying Elvises,&#x201D;</a>, there was no way the first Democratic debate was going to come close to the Trump-fueled spectacle of the previous two Republican ones. And yet, what it lacked in rhetorical fireworks the Democratic debate more than made up for in clarity. After <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/10/hillary-clinton-2016-emails-213241">seven horrendous months</a> of declining poll numbers and growing questions about her political talents, on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, Hillary Clinton demonstrated that, barring a major unforeseen development, she&#x2019;ll be her party&#x2019;s nominee&#x2014;in large part because, whatever her weaknesses, she&#x2019;s still pretty strong, and her four Democratic opponents at the moment are all pretty weak themselves. </p><p data-reactid=".15vy131mbcw.1.1.0.0.4.1">From the moment Clinton walked out on the stage, shaking hands with but refusing to even look at Bernie Sanders and Martin O&#x2019;Malley, it was clear she was just a cut above the rest of the Democratic field in smoothness and in stature. She deftly handled Anderson Cooper&#x2019;s first question about her many flip-flops&#x2014;on everything from gay marriage to the Trans-Pacific Partnership&#x2014;by explaining that she &#x201C;absorb[s] new information&#x201D; and adjusts accordingly. Was she a progressive or a moderate? Cooper pressed, since she&#x2019;s claimed to be both. In a bit of triangulation her husband would appreciate, she replied that she was &#x201C;a progressive, but a progressive who likes to get things done.&#x201D; No doubt aware of her own vulnerabilities, she managed to get to Sanders&#x2019;s left on gun control, hitting him for his Senate vote to give gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits, and she even pretended to be to his left on financial reform. And she actually leaned into the inevitable questions about her e-mail, making full use of Kevin McCarthy&#x2019;s brain-dead admission that the Benghazi Committee was a GOP mission to attack her candidacy. Her declaration that &#x201C;I&#x2019;m still standing&#x201D; was like a flashback to the late &#x2019;90s, when she and Bill ran circles around their Republican tormentors.</p><p data-reactid=".15vy131mbcw.1.1.0.0.4.2">Of course, it helped that Clinton&#x2019;s most serious Democratic opponent came to her aid on that particular issue, which, just a few weeks ago, seemed to pose the most serious threat to her candidacy. &#x201C;The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails,&#x201D; Sanders said, in what was undoubtedly the line of the night&#x2014;but a line that will benefit her more than it will him. Indeed, that line and the debate as a whole showed why&#x2014;despite his huge crowds and strange but undeniable charisma&#x2014;Sanders won&#x2019;t beat Clinton. It&#x2019;s not just because Americans aren&#x2019;t ready to elect a socialist as president, as Cooper bluntly informed Sanders in his first question to the Vermont Senator; it&#x2019;s because Sanders is more interested in focusing on issues and critiquing the media&#x2019;s lack of focus on those issues than actually defeating the front-runner. </p><p data-reactid=".15vy131mbcw.1.1.0.0.4.3">Martin O&#x2019;Malley desperately wants to beat Clinton and Sanders, and after making an issue over the dearth of Democratic debates, he seized the moment, enjoying his finest two hours of the campaign to date. After Clinton seemed to put him in his place by reminding him that he&#x2019;d endorsed her in 2008, he turned the issue around on her by noting that the financial collapse had occurred in the intervening seven years and her refusal to get tougher on big banks and support the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall was reason enough for him to run against her in 2016. It was a strong, competent, by-the-numbers debate performance for O&#x2019;Malley. But it actually might work against him in the sense that it makes him seem like even more of a standard-issue pol, which, of course, is the worst thing you can be in the current political environment. </p><p data-reactid=".15vy131mbcw.1.1.0.0.4.5">There&#x2019;s nothing standard-issue about Lincoln Chafee or Jim Webb; unfortunately for them, the debate revealed that they&#x2019;re just too weird to be taken seriously. Webb was probably the most interesting guy on the stage. A military hero, acclaimed novelist, and heterodox Democrat who ran for the Senate to protest the Iraq War, his differences with Hillary on foreign policy are as stark and as substantive as Sanders&#x2019;s are with the front-runner on domestic policy. It would have been nice if he&#x2019;d spent some time expanding on them. Instead, he mostly grumbled to Cooper about how little speaking time he was getting&#x2014;so much so that at one point Cooper admonished him that he was wasting time with his complaints. And then there was Chafee, who supplanted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1w3FgB0Ohc">James &#x201C;Who Am I? Why Am I Here?&#x201D; Stockdale</a> at the top of the list for most loopy debate performance of the modern era. Whether he was describing himself as &#x201C;granite&#x201D; or admitting that he had no idea what he was voting on when he first arrived in the Senate, Chafee unwittingly made a strong case that, for the second debate, the Democrats should steal a page from the GOP and have a &#x201C;kids&#x2019; table&#x201D; debate, so that Chafee can sit there by himself.</p><p data-reactid=".15vy131mbcw.1.1.0.0.4.6">Of course, by the time that second Democratic debate rolls around one month from now in Iowa, we should know if there&#x2019;ll be another person on that stage. If Biden does ultimately decide to run, he&#x2019;ll have to get into the race by November in order to make various filing deadlines. But it&#x2019;s hard to see him jumping in after tonight. The first Democratic debate served as a useful and necessary reality check. For all of Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s problems, the race for the Democratic nomination still looks very much like it did back when she was riding high: It remains hers to lose; on Tuesday night she gave every indication that she won&#x2019;t.</p><p data-reactid=".15vy131mbcw.1.1.0.0.4.7"><em><strong><a href="../contributor/jason-zengerle">Jason Zengerle</a></strong> is </em>GQ<em>&#x2019;s Political
