  	    "articleBody": "\u000A\u000AEssential to becoming a man, or a woman, is that by definition, you are also no longer a child. And part of skating into that weird abstract awareness where you know you\u0027re not a child anymore is that you feel the hooks of once-favorite things falling out, even if, in finally feeling this, you also kind of get that the hooks had fallen out a while ago. That you\u0027d been off the line for ages.\u000A\u000A For the generation weaned on Harry Potter, it\u0027s time to talk about this out in the open. We\u0027ve never been given the chance, with the constant, deliberate assault of books and movies, to figure it out for ourselves. But it\u0027s the truth. I don\u0027t give a damn about Harry Potter anymore.\u000A\u000A By brilliantly pacing the releases so that it feels like there never isn\u0027t a new Harry Potter story to consume, author J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros. ensured that guys who signed up at the beginning, while still boys, have never been allowed to grow out of the franchise. Now, 13 years after the U.S. publication of the first book—we\u0027re 14 total books and movies into the cycle—we, the Harry Potter generation, have become men. We\u0027ve grown enough to realize that the appeal for our younger selves means nothing. The film version of the second half of the seventh book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, hits theaters July 15, because—in an ostentatious and sort of obnoxious decision—the first half of the seventh book had its own film.\u000A\u000A See, here\u0027s the tricky thing. We\u0027ve been shackled with a feeling of obligation, like we owe something to the creators because they know that we grew up with Harry. Not in the way that I grew up with the New York Jets, or Philip Roth novels, or Spoon albums; things that have left indelible marks on who I am.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s more literal: I actually grew up with Harry Potter; guys from my generation were the same age as him, keeping pace from year to year, book to book. I might as well have been imprisoned at the same isolationist British boarding school, for all I could do to escape. Don\u0027t get me wrong; as the books came out, I lapped them up. We all did.\u000A\u000A But since the books themselves were exhausted in July 2007—four years ago!—there have been inane films that incurred a kind of Stockholm syndrome, leaving us unable to sense the manipulation. We\u0027d become men who attended either by the perceived notion of choice or at the imperative of girls who, hilariously, seem to get more and more excited for each edition.\u000A\u000A (If you\u0027ve never seen the phenomenon of college girls staring down a Harry Potter release date, just take my word for it. They make soccer hooligans look ambivalent.)\u000A\u000A For a while, this was all right, because the books for young kids and teenagers did something unbelievable. The urge to \u0022escape\u0022 dominates the discussion of fantasy lit, but most Harry Potter readers had no interest in other fantasy, an often ridiculous, self-serious genre where the main reason to create a world is so it can lay in wait, quivering for some hero to save it. What enthralled a huge swath of American kids weren\u0027t just the fantasy aspects: the sensationalism, the magic, the Cinderella story, the stupid names of every single character (Severus, Albus, Mundungus, all better fit for Roman eunuchs).\u000A\u000A Instead, the books ruled because they were so believably mundane. If you\u0027ve ever read a Harry Potter book, you know that, up until the seventh, most of the activity from page to page was just the characters going to class, or playing intramural sports, or being socially awkward. Reading them, I didn\u0027t feel like I wanted to be Harry; I didn\u0027t see Harry as some put-upon avatar of my own childhood struggles, or a manifestation of the suppressed power that I\u0027d always thought I had, or a realization of my dreams to one day ascend to some upper caste. I just felt like I knew the guy.\u000A\u000A Rowling writes funny, and she does a fantastic job using the sheer ordinariness of the action to make the unreality more appealing. Following Harry through school, it was like, why the hell not: for all us Americans know, this could be exactly what British boarding school is like. And there has always been a clear villain. The Harry Potter books are so morally reductionist they make the Catholic Church look conflicted.\u000A\u000A But obviously, the movies couldn\u0027t go on for 800 pages in a never-ending imitation of the average school year. They had to function as highlight reels; like watching a clip from SportsCenter, they gave some vague idea of what made the franchise so compelling for a kid in school, but the struggle and significance of the narrative disappeared. Other than the third film, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban—when what must have been extraordinarily confused studio ecutives handed the reins to the auteur Alfonso Cuarón, and he drew the shades down on the central Potter idea of having a gift and being hunted for it, and made a really good film—the movies have all been middling melodramas at best, marred by overacting and poor direction, not worth watching more than once, even on a plane.\u000A\u000A Even bad, though, these movies served a purpose. But now there will be pressure to see it just because it\u0027s the last one, to wrap things up nicely; you figure, you\u0027ve done 14 whatevers already, you might as well get it over with. But don\u0027t. Make a stand. Take back your agency, your right to decide the movies you overpay for.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s no betrayal. Don\u0027t worry: The Warner Bros. box office won\u0027t miss you. Deathly Hallows will make oil money no matter what. And maybe you even want to see it. Don\u0027t give in. If we can\u0027t ward off nostalgia, control our urge to watch three kids wander around some English forest for three hours while their hormones yell at each other, then maybe we\u0027ve already lost. In which case: I hear there\u0027s a new Winnie the Pooh flick coming tomorrow. You probably remember that from your childhood, too.",

We&apos;ve been shackled with a feeling of <em>obligation</em>, like we owe something to the creators because they know that we grew up with Harry. Not in the way that I grew up with the New York Jets, or Philip Roth novels, or Spoon albums; things that have left indelible marks on who I am.</p><p data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.4.6"> It&apos;s more literal: I <em>actually</em> grew up with Harry Potter; guys from my generation were the same age as him, keeping pace from year to year, book to book. I might as well have been imprisoned at the same isolationist British boarding school, for all I could do to escape. Don&apos;t get me wrong; as the books came out, I lapped them up. We all did.</p><p data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.4.7"> But since the books themselves were exhausted in July 2007&#x2014;four years ago!&#x2014;there have been inane films that incurred a kind of Stockholm syndrome, leaving us unable to sense the manipulation. We&apos;d become men who attended either by the perceived notion of choice or at the imperative of girls who, hilariously, seem to get more and more excited for each edition.</p><p data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.4.8"> (If you&apos;ve never seen the phenomenon of college girls staring down a <em>Harry Potter</em> release date, just take my word for it. They make soccer hooligans look ambivalent.)</p><p data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.4.9"> For a while, this was all right, because the books for young kids and teenagers did something unbelievable. The urge to &quot;escape&quot; dominates the discussion of fantasy lit, but most <em>Harry Potter</em> readers had no interest in other fantasy, an often ridiculous, self-serious genre where the main reason to create a world is so it can lay in wait, quivering for some hero to save it. What enthralled a huge swath of American kids weren&apos;t just the fantasy aspects: the sensationalism, the magic, the Cinderella story, the stupid names of every single character (Severus, Albus, Mundungus, all better fit for Roman eunuchs).</p><p data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.4.a"> Instead, the books ruled because they were so believably <em>mundane</em>. If you&apos;ve ever read a <em>Harry Potter</em> book, you know that, up until the seventh, most of the activity from page to page was just the characters going to class, or playing intramural sports, or being socially awkward. Reading them, I didn&apos;t feel like I wanted to be Harry; I didn&apos;t see Harry as some put-upon avatar of my own childhood struggles, or a manifestation of the suppressed power that I&apos;d always thought I had, or a realization of my dreams to one day ascend to some upper caste. I just felt like I knew the guy.</p><p data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.4.b"> Rowling writes funny, and she does a fantastic job using the sheer ordinariness of the action to make the unreality more appealing. Following Harry through school, it was like, why the hell not: for all us Americans know, this could be exactly what British boarding school is like. And there has always been a clear villain. The <em>Harry Potter</em> books are so morally reductionist they make the Catholic Church look conflicted.</p><p data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.4.c"> But obviously, the movies couldn&apos;t go on for 800 pages in a never-ending imitation of the average school year. They had to function as highlight reels; like watching a clip from <em>SportsCenter</em>, they gave some vague idea of what made the franchise so compelling for a kid in school, but the struggle and significance of the narrative disappeared. Other than the third film, <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em>&#x2014;when what must have been extraordinarily confused studio ecutives handed the reins to the auteur Alfonso Cuar&#xF3;n, and he drew the shades down on the central <em>Potter</em> idea of having a gift and being hunted for it, and made a really good film&#x2014;the movies have all been middling melodramas at best, marred by overacting and poor direction, not worth watching more than once, even on a plane.</p><p data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Even bad, though, these movies served a purpose. But now there will be pressure to see it just <em>because</em> it&apos;s the last one, to wrap things up nicely; you figure, you&apos;ve done 14 whatevers already, you might as well get it over with. But don&apos;t. Make a stand. Take back your agency, your right to decide the movies you overpay for.</p><p data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.4.e"> It&apos;s no betrayal. Don&apos;t worry: The Warner Bros. box office won&apos;t miss you. <em>Deathly Hallows</em> will make oil money no matter what. And maybe you even want to see it. Don&apos;t give in. If we can&apos;t ward off nostalgia, control our urge to watch three kids wander around some English forest for three hours while their hormones yell at each other, then maybe we&apos;ve already lost. In which case: I hear there&apos;s a new <em>Winnie the Pooh</em> flick coming tomorrow. You probably remember that from your childhood, too.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15" data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0"><div class="component-topics" data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0"><ul data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0"><li data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-0"><a href="../search?tags=Entertainment" data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-0.0">Entertainment</a></li><li data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-1"><a href="../search?tags=Movies%2520+%2520TV" data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-1.0">Movies + TV</a></li><li data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-2"><a href="../search?tags=Harry%2520Potter" data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-2.0">Harry Potter</a></li><li data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-3"><a href="../search?tags=Daniel%2520Radcliffe" data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-3.0">Daniel Radcliffe</a></li><li data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-4"><a href="../search?tags=Harry%2520Potter%2520and%2520the%2520Deathly%2520Hallows:%2520Part%2520II" data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-4.0">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II</a></li><li data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-5"><a href="../search?tags=J.K.%2520Rowling" data-reactid=".28h8ypwkp34.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-5.0">J.K.
