  	    "articleBody": "Rob Garcia, the L.A.-based designer behind the monochromatic, vaguely goth-y luxury brand En Noir, has a lot of tattoos. Like, a lot.  In fact, the dude is almost out of valuable surface area, and is considering drastic means to create some fresh room for new inkage. \u0022I was thinking of possibly going through the process of lasering my right sleeve off and having it redone,\u0022 Garcia says, \u0022to make sure the whole collection I have on my body is consistent and cohesive.\u0022 For GQ Ink Week we spoke with Garcia about his tattoo collection, his favorite artists, and how it all ties back to his Los Angeles streetwear roots.\u000A\u000A\u0022Coming from Southern California and streetwear, it\u0027s a very DIY kind of mentality. We want to do something, but we don\u0027t have the resources or a model to follow. That\u0027s what streetwear\u0027s about.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000AYou got your start in streetwear [Ed note: Garcia used to design for Black Scale], so I guess my first question is what came first for you: tattoos or fashion?Tattoos were definitely before fashion. That was during my time when I was playing college football [in San Diego], and had no idea of the opportunity of me even doing fashion.\u000A\u000AYour tattoos have some really dope religious iconography. Can you talk a little bit about them? Was the black and white thing something you had in mind since the beginning?For me growing up, tattoos were what I saw around me. I\u0027m Mexican and Native American, and my cousins and uncles all had all-black and grey tattoo work that originated in the California prison system. That\u0027s kind of what I saw and gravitated toward. I\u0027ve always been into Renaissance baroque era art, and with my Christian background, it just really made sense for me to gravitate toward that kind of art. So that\u0027s what I started with.\u000A\u000AMost of the word tattoos I have are pretty much 99% Latin. I really like the language—it\u0027s the origin of so many other languages. It\u0027s cool. It\u0027s something that people usually can\u0027t read, and it\u0027s something that you can\u0027t really explain to them. \u000A\u000AI saw lately that you\u0027ve been getting work done by Dr. Woo. How many pieces do you have from him?I have pretty much all my fingers done—seven out of 10 fingers are done by him. I have like five on my neck. One on my left ribs. Two more on my throat, one on my chest. I have quite my collection. [laughs] I\u0027ve been going to him for quite a while. \u000A\u000AI heard the fingers are the most painful place to get tattooed. Is that a fair assessment, especially with Woo\u0027s really fine single-needle stuff?100% the most painful. The single needle feels like someone slicing you open. I had the right side of my head done, places that people think would be waaay more painful. But the hands and the fingers hurt the most.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADoes Woo do your bigger pieces too?For my bigger pieces, my sleeve, my back, my head, I go to Jun Cha—he\u0027s unbelievable. He focuses on bigger pieces and it\u0027s a different process. [With Dr. Woo] it\u0027s like amazing little detailed ones that he knocks out 20 to 30 minutes, maybe an hour. With Jun Cha it\u0027s a process. He wants like at least half of your arm, or a sleeve, or a back piece. He takes one appointment a day. \u000A\u000AWith him it\u0027s like building a canvas of art layer by layer, and he doesn\u0027t finish one tattoo in one sitting. It\u0027s like a layering of layers to create depth. It\u0027s cool to have the balance of both their processes. It\u0027s the best of both worlds; they\u0027re the two best tattoo artists in the world in my opinion. Both of them have that fine art background, and both are at the forefront of really transcending beyond tattoos.\u000A\u000AIf you had to pick two or three, which pieces would you say are your favorites?My favorite tattoos are always the latest. The last one was a Caravaggio by Cha—St. Matthew on the side of my head. I knew I wanted it, but it\u0027s just a big step. I have everything done, but the head is a big commitment. We\u0027re also working on my back—I have a little of shading. That\u0027s my masterpiece, the front door of the Duomo Cathedral.\u000A\u000AMy favorite Woo piece... I\u0027ll say it\u0027s my left ring finger done with dead roses dripping blood. The next one by Woo, I\u0027ll have him do the left side of my head. I like the balance between Jun Cha\u0027s bigger depth and Woo\u0027s white, fine line smaller stuff.\u000A\u000AAre there any tattoos your regret? Or work that you maybe wish you\u0027d thought harder about?My right sleeve is actually what I got done when I was younger in college. It was always good work, but nowhere near the work Woo and Jun Cha are doing. I do have one over my right shoulder and my right side that I got when I was younger that I\u0027m gonna have to laser off so Jun Cha can do my back piece. \u000A\u000ALoadingView on Instagram\u000A\u000ACan you talk a little bit how tattoos have influenced your connection to fashion?With my path to fashion being so different, coming from Southern California, we don\u0027t really have the resources and outlets that New York has—creativity and art schools and maybe just people into those things. Coming from Southern California and streetwear, it\u0027s a very DIY kind of mentality. We want to do something but we don\u0027t have the resources or a model to follow. That\u0027s what streetwear\u0027s about. \u000A\u000AIs that DIY approach at odds with how high fashion operates?That is where it starts, and it ends up making its way to the high-end houses. For them, they\u0027re not really engaged down there. Sometimes they need consultants or focus groups to tell them what\u0027s going on. I always wanted to stay connected, and stay authentic. It\u0027s been good. I think it\u0027s necessary to have that path, to have that other dog who shows you that there\u0027s another way. \u000A\u000AWhen I was coming up, I don\u0027t think there really was, per se, another way. Rick Owens was the one I looked to for similarities, in terms of being from Los Angeles county—he studied at L.A. Trade-Tech and Parsons. And his mom is Mexican too. The authenticity of me coming from streetwear and having that DIY approach has really helped me a lot. That\u0027s a mentality I always wanna keep. Streetwear comes from the ground level, the ground floor. At the end of the day, that\u0027s where everything comes from. I don\u0027t want to lose contact with that. That\u0027s where the youth is, where the ideas come from. That\u0027s one of the strengths I wanna embrace with my brand. I wanna stay connected to that ground level of where things are bubbling.",

Like, <em>a lot</em>.  In fact, the dude is almost out of valuable surface area, and is considering drastic means to create some fresh room for new inkage. &#x201C;I was thinking of possibly going through the process of lasering my right sleeve off and having it redone,&#x201D; Garcia says, &#x201C;to make sure the whole collection I have on my body is consistent and cohesive.&#x201D; For <em>GQ</em> Ink Week we spoke with Garcia about his tattoo collection, his favorite artists, and how it all ties back to his Los Angeles streetwear roots.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.1"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&quot;Coming from Southern California and streetwear, it&#x2019;s a very DIY kind of mentality.

That was during my time when I was playing college football [in San Diego], and had no idea of the opportunity of me even doing fashion.</p><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>Your tattoos have some really dope religious iconography. Can you talk a little bit about them? Was the black and white thing something you had in mind since the beginning?</strong><br>For me growing up, tattoos were what I saw around me. I&#x2019;m Mexican and Native American, and my cousins and uncles all had all-black and grey tattoo work that originated in the California prison system. That&#x2019;s kind of what I saw and gravitated toward. I&#x2019;ve always been into Renaissance baroque era art, and with my Christian background, it just really made sense for me to gravitate toward that kind of art. So that&apos;s what I started with.</p><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.5">Most of the word tattoos I have are pretty much 99% Latin. I really like the language&#x2014;it&apos;s the origin of so many other languages. It&#x2019;s cool. It&#x2019;s something that people usually can&#x2019;t read, and it&#x2019;s something that you can&#x2019;t really explain to them. </p><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>I saw lately that you&#x2019;ve been getting work done by <a href="../gallery/10-tattoo-artists-you-should-be-following-on-instagram">Dr. Woo</a>. How many pieces do you have from him?</strong><br>I have pretty much all my fingers done&#x2014;seven out of 10 fingers are done by him. I have like five on my neck. One on my left ribs. Two more on my throat, one on my chest. I have quite my collection. [<em>laughs</em>] I&#x2019;ve been going to him for quite a while. </p><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>I heard the fingers are the most painful place to get tattooed. Is that a fair assessment, especially with Woo&apos;s really fine single-needle stuff?</strong><br>100% the most painful. The single needle feels like someone slicing you open. I had the right side of my head done, places that people think would be <em>waaay</em> more painful. But the hands and the fingers hurt the most.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.8"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55d34550fb580c9d76560867/master/w_600/garcia3.jpg" alt="garcia3.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frob-garcia-en-noir-tattoo-interview&amp;t=garcia3.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frob-garcia-en-noir-tattoo-interview&amp;t=garcia3.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frob-garcia-en-noir-tattoo-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55d34550fb580c9d76560867%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fgarcia3.jpg&amp;description=garcia3.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frob-garcia-en-noir-tattoo-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55d34550fb580c9d76560867%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fgarcia3.jpg&amp;description=garcia3.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>Does Woo do your bigger pieces too?</strong><br>For my bigger pieces, my sleeve, my back, my head, I go to <a href="https://instagram.com/juncha/?hl=en">Jun Cha</a>&#x2014;he&#x2019;s unbelievable. He focuses on bigger pieces and it&#x2019;s a different process. [With Dr. Woo] it&#x2019;s like amazing little detailed ones that he knocks out 20 to 30 minutes, maybe an hour. With Jun Cha it&#x2019;s a <em>process</em>. He wants like at least half of your arm, or a sleeve, or a back piece. He takes one appointment a day. </p><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.a">With him it&apos;s like building a canvas of art layer by layer, and he doesn&#x2019;t finish one tattoo in one sitting. It&#x2019;s like a layering of layers to create depth. It&#x2019;s cool to have the balance of both their processes. It&#x2019;s the best of both worlds; they&apos;re the two best tattoo artists in the world in my opinion. Both of them have that fine art background, and both are at the forefront of really transcending beyond tattoos.</p><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>If you had to pick two or three, which pieces would you say are your favorites?</strong><br>My favorite tattoos are always the latest. The last one was a Caravaggio by Cha&#x2014;St. Matthew on the side of my head. I knew I wanted it, but it&#x2019;s just a big step. I have <em>everything</em> done, but the head is a big commitment. We&#x2019;re also working on my back&#x2014;I have a little of shading. That&#x2019;s my masterpiece, the front door of the <a href="http://www.visitflorence.com/florence-churches/duomo.html">Duomo Cathedral</a>.</p><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.c">My favorite Woo piece... I&apos;ll say it&apos;s my left ring finger done with dead roses dripping blood. The next one by Woo, I&#x2019;ll have him do the left side of my head. I like the balance between Jun Cha&#x2019;s bigger depth and Woo&#x2019;s white, fine line smaller stuff.</p><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Are there any tattoos your regret? Or work that you maybe wish you&apos;d thought harder about?</strong><br>My right sleeve is actually what I got done when I was younger in college. It was always good work, but nowhere near the work Woo and Jun Cha are doing. I do have one over my right shoulder and my right side that I got when I was younger that I&#x2019;m gonna have to laser off so Jun Cha can do my back piece. </p><div class="embed instagram" data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.e"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="true" data-instgrm-version="2" data-type="instagram"><div class="instagram-media-container"><div class="instagram-media-wrapper"><div class="instagram-media-inner"><div class="instagram-media-view"></div><span class="instagram-media-loading">Loading</span></div></div><p class="instagram-media-more"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/14XOCgPchJ/?taken-by=noirrob" target="blank">View on Instagram</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Can you talk a little bit how tattoos have influenced your connection to fashion?</strong><br>With my path to fashion being so different, coming from Southern California, we don&#x2019;t really have the resources and outlets that New York has&#x2014;creativity and art schools and maybe just people <em>into</em> those things. Coming from Southern California and streetwear, it&#x2019;s a very DIY kind of mentality. We want to do something but we don&#x2019;t have the resources or a model to follow. That&#x2019;s what streetwear&#x2019;s about. </p><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Is that DIY approach at odds with how high fashion operates?</strong><br>That is where it starts, and it ends up making its way to the high-end houses. For them, they&#x2019;re not really engaged down there. Sometimes they need consultants or focus groups to tell them what&#x2019;s going on. I always wanted to stay connected, and stay authentic. It&#x2019;s been good. I think it&#x2019;s necessary to have that path, to have that other dog who shows you that there&#x2019;s another way. </p><p data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.4.h">When I was coming up, I don&#x2019;t think there really was, per se, another way. Rick Owens was the one I looked to for similarities, in terms of being from Los Angeles county&#x2014;he studied at L.A. Trade-Tech and Parsons. And his mom is Mexican too. The authenticity of me coming from streetwear and having that DIY approach has really helped me a lot. That&#x2019;s a mentality I always wanna keep. Streetwear comes from the ground level, the ground floor. At the end of the day, that&#x2019;s where everything comes from. I don&#x2019;t want to lose contact with that. That&#x2019;s where the youth is, where the ideas come from. That&#x2019;s one of the strengths I wanna embrace with my brand. I wanna stay connected to that ground level of where things are bubbling.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".11frafggsg0.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div
