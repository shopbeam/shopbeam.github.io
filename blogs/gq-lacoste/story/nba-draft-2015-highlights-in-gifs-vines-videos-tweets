  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFor basketball nerds, the NBA Draft is pure hoops porn: analysis, film, highlights, rumors. But sports porn is still porn. It\u0027s empty, superficial and substance-less. The only real moments are those fifteen to twenty seconds when the young, tall, athletic guy gets his name called by an older, awkward-looking guy in glasses, smiles, sometimes cries, puts on a hat whose color scheme clashes with his suit and walks to the stage to have his photo taken with his new boss. It\u0027s those moments, when a dream becomes a realized dream, that the players will remember forever. And it\u0027s those moments, the hugs with smiley mommas, the over-the-top handshakes, and the wet kisses with girlfriends, that we, the viewers, will remember forever...because they\u0027re on the Internet. Here are the best GIFs, Vines, and Tweets from Round One of the 2015 NBA Draft (because, honestly, who watched Round Two?).\u000A\u000AThe night started off with a slick, professionally made photograph of the 2015 Class (see above). But, since some of these dudes weren\u0027t born until 1996NINETEEN-NINETY-SIX!! Even Simba was born in 1994they weren\u0027t happy with the photo being made in the \u0022old style,\u0022 and took the matter into their hands, and into their selfie stick.\u000A\u000A Relive the 2015 #NBADraft with @NBAcom\u0027s Live Blog (via @langwhitaker): http://t.co/lZAtHMxy2k pic.twitter.com/m1EdqudDxj\u000A\u000A NBA (@NBA) June 26, 2015\u000A\u000AKarl Anthony Towns was taken by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the number one overall pick.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADid you catch that? Big KAT, as some are now calling him, dapped up his dad, and then went in for the man hug, before thinking, \u0022You know what, if I don\u0027t hug mom first, she\u0027s probably gonna whoop my ass.\u0022 Young fellas, this is the type of decision-making GMs look for in the guys they are trusting to become the savior of their franchise.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestKAT-DAD.gif\u000A\u000AIt didn\u0027t take long for his teammates to get behind him. Ricky Rubio waited all of six second before letting the hazing begin.\u000A\u000A Hello @KarlTowns !! You ready to pick up my dry cleaning tomorrow ?? #WelcomeRook\u000A\u000A Ricky Rubio (@rickyrubio9) June 25, 2015\u000A\u000AThe Lakers shocked some folks in taking guard D\u0027Angelo Russell second, and thus left the 76ers no choice but to take Jhalil Okafor, big man from Duke. Joel Embiid, big man from Kansas who they drafted last year, was super fired up about his new practice buddy!\u000A\u000A OK........... Lol\u000A\u000A Joel Embiid (@JoelEmbiid) June 25, 2015\u000A\u000AThen it was the Knicks turn to do the two things the Knicks do best: extinguish the flame of hope from the soul of New Yorkers, and make kids cry. They didn\u0027t disappoint. They were rumored to be taking Kristaps Porzingis. Who is Kristaps Porzingis, you ask?\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s a 19-year-old, 7\u00271\u0022 mostly unproven Latvian who can shoot, and who\u0027s packed with potential, but not much experience. Some are saying he could be a superstar, and some are saying he could not be a superstar, which is a pretty broad spectrum. His interests are:\u000A\u000ARihanna...\u000A\u000A Actual exchange today:Me: \u0022If you could go to dinner with any 3 people...?\u0022Porzingis: \u0022Rihanna, Beyonce and Jay-Z--like a double date.\u0022\u000A\u000A Abe Schwadron (@abe_squad) June 24, 2015\u000A\u000A...WorldStar HipHop...\u000A\u000A \u0022He has a great sense of American culture,\u0022 a Kristaps Porzingis teammate told me. \u0022He goes on WorldStarHipHop every day.\u0022\u000A\u000A Ben Cohen (@bzcohen) June 26, 2015\u000A\u000A...but not every day...\u000A\u000A I told Kristaps Porzingis this week that I heard he went on WorldStar every day. Zinger\u0027s response: \u0022Not every day.\u0022\u000A\u000A Ben Cohen (@bzcohen) June 26, 2015\u000A\u000AAnd the movie Friday.\u000A\u000A So: Who is Kristaps Porzingis? Watch the tape, check the stats, and know that his favorite movie ever is \u0022Friday.\u0022 http://t.co/kvyCflrvHV\u000A\u000A SportsGrid (@SportsGrid) June 26, 2015\u000A\u000AKnicks were not particularly thrilled about the idea of getting Kristaps. Similarly, Knicks fans were not particularly thrilled when the Knicks actually drafted Kristaps.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThat small fan\u0027s singular reaction was the city\u0027s collective reaction. It\u0027s also ironic he was recording himself crying (fake crying?), presumably worried his reaction might not be captured, and now he\u0027s going to live on the Internet forever. Welcome to 2015, kid, where virality finds you and Knicks fans live in a bleak, sunless void of despair.\u000A\u000AThe big question remaining was: Where would JC Penney-sponsored Frank Kaminsky and GQ-approved Justise Winslow end up? Earlier in the year, in an ESPN profile by Pablo Torre, Kaminsky had made these remarks about why he chose to stay at Wisconsin:\u000A\u000A\u0022I am at the pinnacle of my basketball career, at least in my eyes,\u0022 he wrote. \u0022I know the NBA has their crazy fans and all, but ... there are games when teams like the Bobcats get hardly any fans, and it looks flat-out boring.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhich prompted his buddy to say:\u000A\u000AAs forward Duje Dukan, Kaminsky\u0027s road roommate, told him, \u0022Well, now you\u0027re not going to get drafted by the Bobcats.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe got drafted by the Bobcats. But he took it all in stride, looking fly in his Frank the Tank lined suit.\u000A\u000A Frank the 2 Tanks. pic.twitter.com/C13SRX7pXh\u000A\u000A Cork Gaines (@CorkGaines) June 26, 2015\u000A\u000AJustise Winslow, who many picked to go in the Top 5, fell to the Miami Heat at 10. We think, and hope, he has a long and productive NBA career, but we know his suit game will be on point.\u000A\u000A   @IAmJustise Winslow heating things up at the #NBADraft. The @miamiheat pick was styled by GQ\u0027s very own @jimmooregq in a @suitsupply suit. (Photo by @dylancoulter) @nba\u000A\u000A A photo posted by GQ (@gq) on Jun 25, 2015 at 7:50pm PDT\u000A\u000ACameron Payne is going to play with Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant in Oklahoma City. Great basketball player, but lousy Millennial. He had to ask his mom for help operating his selfie stick.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHe also referred to himself in the third person. Who needs other people when you can take pictures of yourself, and also talk about yourself? This kid is his own universe!\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHere are Kelly Oubre\u0027s shoes presented without comment.\u000A\u000A Wiz draft pick K. Oubre: \u0022I\u0027m ready to win a championship. And whatever team gets me, we\u0027re winning a championship.\u0022 http://t.co/yqmpdZEP3I\u000A\u000A Dan Steinberg (@dcsportsbog) June 26, 2015\u000A\u000ATerry Rozier was drafted by the Celtics, and then jumped into the pool in his draft suit. GQ is very happy for Terry but we kindly ask that he treat his suits with a little more consideration.\u000A\u000A Terry Rozier Jumped into a Pool in His Suit to Celebrate Getting Picked by Celtics: Video of [@TRozzay3](https://twitter.com/TRozzay3) heari... http://t.co/BMoaW6rpTu\u000A\u000A Cameron West (@Sports42Fanatic) June 26, 2015\u000A\u000AWe imagine he went home, dried off, and then made his favorite sandwich, which consists of bread, spaghetti, ranch, and sugar.\u000A\u000A Celtics draft pick Terry Rozier explains his love of spaghetti ranch sugar sandwiches (http://t.co/VZVj2LxA5z) pic.twitter.com/8XPlaC9DHT\u000A\u000A Chris Forsberg (@ESPNForsberg) June 26, 2015\u000A\u000AAnd, finally, RJ Hunter was drafted by the Boston Celtics with the 28th pick, which means that wherever his dadand college coachRon was, he was probably doing this.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ACongrats to all the proud mamas and papas, and, most of all, to the players themselves. We wish you all the best going forward, and want to remind you that ever if your careers don\u0027t pan out on the court, as long as you look good off of it, we won\u0027t hate. Unless you jump in the damn pool with your suit.",

nerds, the NBA Draft is pure hoops porn: analysis, film, highlights, rumors. But sports porn is still porn. It&#x2019;s empty, superficial and substance-less. The only real moments are those fifteen to twenty seconds when the young, tall, athletic guy gets his name called by an older, awkward-looking guy in glasses, smiles, sometimes cries, puts on a hat whose color scheme clashes with his suit and walks to the stage to have his photo taken with his new boss. It&#x2019;s those moments, when a dream becomes a realized dream, that the players will remember forever. And it&#x2019;s those moments, the hugs with smiley mommas, the over-the-top handshakes, and the wet kisses with girlfriends, that we, the viewers, will remember forever...because they&#x2019;re on the Internet. Here are the best GIFs, Vines, and Tweets from Round One of the 2015 NBA Draft (because, honestly, who watched Round Two?).</p><p data-reactid=".obg7o76pz4.1.1.0.0.4.2">The night started off with a slick, professionally made photograph of the 2015 Class (see above).
