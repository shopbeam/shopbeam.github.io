  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADavid Cross is asking his wife what his best physical attribute is. Amber Tamblyn, nineteen years younger and an actress, responds: his legs. \u0022I do a lot of walking,\u0022 he explains. \u0022A lot of biking. I\u0027m very active in the leg department.\u0022 Most comedians would have thrown a joke in there somewhere. In person, forty-nine-year-old David Cross is short, bald and pale—like he is on TV and the stage—but not terribly funny. He doesn\u0027t try to be. Mitch Hurwitz, the creator of Arrested Development, which Fox cancelled in 2006 and Netflix brought back on May 26th starring Cross as \u0022never-nude\u0022 Tobias Fnke, doesn\u0027t get it either.\u000A\u000A\u0022When the camera goes on,\u0022 says Hurwitz, \u0022there\u0027s nobody funnier on the show. It\u0027s like watching Clark Kent turn into Superman. I remember him slipping on Lucille\u0027s spilled vodka in a scene. It was one of the most unheralded pratfalls in the history of cinema: I don\u0027t think Buster Keaton could have done it better.\u0022\u000A\u000ACross peers out the window of his large, twelfth floor apartment in Brooklyn. \u0022I don\u0027t understand metaphor,\u0022 he\u0027s saying now, \u0022which makes it hard to grasp my wife\u0027s poetry. But I try.\u0022 He\u0027s wearing a dad-like pair of New Balance shoes, and slacks, earnestly talking about poetry. I notice something on the floor, in a corner, called The Marriage Blanket. Eager to change the subject, I ask what it is. \u0022It prevents farting,\u0022 Cross says, finally joking. I think.\u000A\u000AOn trying to fit in at a suburban Atlanta middle school: It was awful, and I hated it. I felt so out of place, and weird, and I didn\u0027t have many friends. It was very white, Baptist, suburban—just a world I wasn\u0027t comfortable in. Though I did try. I actually chewed tobacco for a year—Skoal and Copenhagen—and ran around in a sleeveless puffy vest. But the high school where I transferred was a school of the arts, so I didn\u0027t have to do P.E. and run around a gym while people made fun of my legs. I got to spend that time with a great acting teacher who I really credit a lot with steering me in a good direction. Away from puffy vests and Skoal.\u000A\u000AOn what he did as a teenager in Atlanta: We had four drinking spots, all outside. The best was a billboard downtown by the Days Inn that we used to climb. We\u0027d also go to the top of the Biltmore and drink beer up there, and the top of the Hyatt Regency, both of which were really easy, back in those days, to get into. And then there were midnight movies at Perimeter Mall. I had a fake I.D., so I\u0027d go to a couple bars on Spring Street. And then, sometimes, comedy clubs: I started doing stand-up shortly before my 18th birthday. I got into the whole crazy, artsy, New Wave \u0022fag\u0022 scene. I hung out with RuPaul and some of those guys. And then, you know, about three in the morning we\u0027d go to the Waffle House.\u000A\u000AOn the first time he performed on stage: I killed. I mean crushed it. It was insane, like a bad movie. And then, the next thirty-seven times I ate it. Which I should have. I was a kid with weird, esoteric material overly influenced by Andy Kaufman and Steven Wright. I looked like a kid and a bit of a freak: I had kind of a Jewfro and I wore an army jacket with shit written in sharpie and a bunch of punk band buttons on it and my hat. So I didn\u0027t look accessible. I worked for Domino\u0027s and Pizza Hut and saved up some money and went to Boston to go to college but dropped out immediately and got on stage. You gotta remember, I was 18: Me and a friend did these bits where we had seen aliens, like we were just dumb redneck farmers and we were describing the aliens and I don\u0027t remember what the joke was, but this was in the age of PTL Club, Jim Bakker, all that stuff on channel 46, whatever my friends and I were watching and making fun of. We\u0027d call in to the shows!\u000A\u000AOn not understanding metaphor: I take things quite literally and sometimes I\u0027ll hear a joke, walk out of a movie, finish a book and there\u0027s something that everyone else got that I missed. The most embarrassing example is, there\u0027s a great book called Swing Hammer, Swing, a Scottish book, set in Glasgow, in the late sixties, when things are shitty. Bob Odenkirk gave me the book and said, \u0022You gotta read this.\u0022 Towards the latter half the protagonist is talking about how he\u0027s just gonna go down under. And the entire time, I\u0027m thinking Australia. And I\u0027m not seeing that as a metaphor for killing himself and going to hell. Bob laughed in my face.\u000A\u000AOn writing poetry for his wife: I tried to write stuff for Amber on a number of occasions but it\u0027s terrible. Like to the point of tearing up, and going, \u0022Nobody can ever see this.\u0022 I just don\u0027t work that way. I wish I did, I wish I had that talent. I can\u0027t draw, I can\u0027t do symbolism. I really, really, really have to concentrate when she shows me poems she\u0027s working on. I get nervous. Other people read it and go, \u0022Oh this is great! I love this and this.\u0022 And I look at it like a befuddled child looking at Algebra. I get the words and I know there\u0027s something I\u0027m supposed to be looking for and I... it\u0027s embarrassing. It makes you feel stupid.\u000A\u000AJoking about his acting method: There was one minor thing that happened when I was younger that I used to inform the Cain character [in Year One]. The director didn\u0027t even know about this at the time I was cast, but I did kill my brother. I beat him over the head until he was unconscious, then I buried him up to his head—but I did it the other way, head first, up to his neck basically. And then I just scribbled on him with a sharpie until he died!\u000A\u000AOn his banjo: I like banjo music. I was given a banjo as a gift from the producers of Todd Margaret. I\u0027d told them I loved Earl Scruggs. We\u0027d get drunk and imitate the banjo sound with our mouths, and they\u0027d make fun of me for being a hick. Then they gave me that banjo and I started taking lessons. It\u0027s really hard.\u000A\u000AOn inheritances from his British father: My teeth are bucked out. But I never thought about my penchant for liking rainy, cooler overcast weather and drinking beer. My birthday dinner when I was a kid was fish and chips, at Arthur Treacher\u0027s. I loved Monty Python. The Who was my favorite band. I was such an Anglophile. And all these little things made sense later. Except the cannabalism.\u000A\u000AOn being disillusioned with politics: It\u0027s pathetic that we\u0027re applauding that a president mentions gay rights in 2013. That that\u0027s some sort of accomplishment is sad to me. I feel really bad for people who were like myself twenty years ago, who really bought into hope and go, \u0022Things are going to be great now! We\u0027re going to lead the world in tolerance, and freedom, and progressive ideals, and equality, and justice.\u0022 And of course that didn\u0027t happen. We\u0027re a business. It\u0027s not being jaded or cynical to state the obvious: that all politicians have to lie. You can\u0027t appeal to a hundred and fifty million Americans and not lie to get everyone on your side.\u000A\u000AOn money: The biggest payday I ever got was for the Alvin and the Chipmunks movie. I didn\u0027t get paid much for the first one, but I was contractually obligated to do the following. Nobody ever thought there would be three movies, not even the studio. I hadn\u0027t worked in six months, which was starting to drive me crazy and I was like, Yeah, fuck it, I want work. So I did it. I didn\u0027t get much money at first, but I got money in bonuses because it did so well. And then the second movie I did, I got more. And after doing the third one I thought, Shit, well, I\u0027m set. I\u0027ve got Chipmunks money! And it allowed me to go to London and make Todd Margaret at a loss.\u000A\u000AOn the future of television: When you say online, that connotes computers, but I watch NetFlix on my TV. Yes, through a computer, but it doesn\u0027t feel online. Nobody really cares. They just want to go click their button and it comes up on their TV screen. No matter what cable it\u0027s going through, it\u0027s on TV. Whether it\u0027s NetFlix or Stars or Showtime or NBC or Wii, it doesn\u0027t matter. Even if it\u0027s YouTube through the fucking TV, AppleTV, whatever it is, that\u0027s TV.\u000A\u000AOn his level of fame: There are hardcore comedy fans who have known about me for 20 years, and people who don\u0027t know about Mr. Show but know Arrested Development and the time I was on Conan and wore something silly. But for most, I\u0027m just \u0022That Guy!\u0022 When I went through the TSA line recently, this one guy was like, Oh hey, oh shit, yo yo, that\u0027s the actor... who you from, where you with, who did you do? No, I know what it was, it was, what was it? You was in Scream, right? Was you in Scream? Shit like that. I\u0027ll never be the dude with the security detail. Nature has leveled it all out for me. I\u0027m never going to be Captain America.\u000A\u000AOn owning jean shorts: I don\u0027t. But I have very nice calves. Often remarked upon, in fact. I do a lot of walking, a lot of biking. I\u0027m very active in the leg department. My wife says my legs are my best physical attribute.",

asking his wife what his best physical attribute is. Amber Tamblyn, nineteen years younger and an actress, responds: his legs. &quot;I do a lot of walking,&quot; he explains. &quot;A lot of biking. I&#x2019;m very active in the leg department.&quot; Most comedians would have thrown a joke in there somewhere. In person, forty-nine-year-old David Cross is short, bald and pale&#x2014;like he is on TV and the stage&#x2014;but not terribly funny. He doesn&#x2019;t try to be. Mitch Hurwitz, the creator of <em>Arrested Development</em>, which <em>Fox</em> cancelled in 2006 and Netflix brought back on May 26th starring Cross as &quot;never-nude&quot; Tobias Fnke, doesn&#x2019;t get it either.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.2">&quot;When the camera goes on,&quot; says Hurwitz, &quot;there&#x2019;s nobody funnier on the show. It&#x2019;s like watching Clark Kent turn into Superman. I remember him <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mC7jEMtjCE">slipping</a> on Lucille&#x2019;s spilled vodka in a scene. It was one of the most unheralded pratfalls in the history of cinema: I don&#x2019;t think Buster Keaton could have done it better.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.3">Cross peers out the window of his large, twelfth floor apartment in Brooklyn. &quot;I don&#x2019;t understand metaphor,&quot; he&#x2019;s saying now, &quot;which makes it hard to grasp my wife&#x2019;s poetry. But I try.&quot; He&#x2019;s wearing a dad-like pair of New Balance shoes, and slacks, <em>earnestly</em> <em>talking about poetry</em>. I notice something on the floor, in a corner, called The Marriage Blanket. Eager to change the subject, I ask what it is. &quot;It prevents farting,&quot; Cross says, finally joking. I think.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>On trying to fit in at a suburban Atlanta middle school</strong>: It was awful, and I hated it. I felt so out of place, and weird, and I didn&#x2019;t have many friends. It was very white, Baptist, suburban&#x2014;just a world I wasn&#x2019;t comfortable in. Though I did try. I actually chewed tobacco for a year&#x2014;Skoal and Copenhagen&#x2014;and ran around in a sleeveless puffy vest. But the high school where I transferred was a school of the arts, so I didn&#x2019;t have to do P.E. and run around a gym while people made fun of my legs. I got to spend that time with a great acting teacher who I really credit a lot with steering me in a good direction. Away from puffy vests and Skoal.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>On what he did as a teenager in Atlanta:</strong> We had four drinking<strong> </strong>spots<strong>, </strong>all outside. The best<strong> </strong>was a billboard downtown by the Days Inn that we used to climb. We&#x2019;d also go to the top of the Biltmore and drink beer up there, and the top of the Hyatt Regency, both of which were really easy, back in those days, to get into. And then there were midnight movies at Perimeter Mall. I had a fake I.D., so I&#x2019;d go to a couple bars on Spring Street. And then, sometimes, comedy clubs: I started doing stand-up shortly before my 18th birthday. I got into the whole crazy, artsy, New Wave &quot;fag&quot; scene. I hung out with RuPaul and some of those guys. And then, you know, about three in the morning we&#x2019;d go to the Waffle House.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>On the first time he performed on stage</strong>: I killed. I mean crushed it. It was insane, like a bad movie. And then, the next thirty-seven times I ate it. Which I should have. I was a kid with weird, esoteric material overly influenced by Andy Kaufman and Steven Wright. I looked like a kid and a bit of a freak: I had kind of a Jewfro and I wore an army jacket with shit written in sharpie and a bunch of punk band buttons on it and my hat. So I didn&#x2019;t look accessible. I worked for Domino&#x2019;s and Pizza Hut and saved up some money and went to Boston to go to college but dropped out immediately and got on stage. You gotta remember, I was 18: Me and a friend did these bits where we had seen aliens, like we were just dumb redneck farmers and we were describing the aliens and I don&#x2019;t remember what the joke was, but this was in the age of PTL Club, Jim Bakker, all that stuff on channel 46, whatever my friends and I were watching and making fun of. We&#x2019;d call in to the shows!</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>On not understanding metaphor</strong>: I take things quite literally and sometimes I&#x2019;ll hear a joke, walk out of a movie, finish a book and there&#x2019;s something that everyone else got that I missed. The most embarrassing example is, there&#x2019;s a great book called <em>Swing Hammer, Swing</em>, a Scottish book, set in Glasgow, in the late sixties, when things are shitty. Bob Odenkirk gave me the book and said, &quot;You gotta read this.&quot; Towards the latter half the protagonist is talking about how he&#x2019;s just gonna go <em>down under</em>. And the entire time, I&#x2019;m thinking Australia. And I&#x2019;m not seeing that as a metaphor for killing himself and going to hell. Bob laughed in my face.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>On writing poetry for his wife</strong>: I tried to write stuff for Amber on a number of occasions but it&#x2019;s terrible. Like to the point of tearing up, and going, &quot;Nobody can ever see this.&quot; I just don&#x2019;t work that way. I wish I did, I wish I had that talent. I can&#x2019;t draw, I can&#x2019;t do symbolism. I really, really, really have to concentrate when she shows me poems she&#x2019;s working on. I get nervous. Other people read it and go, &quot;Oh this is great! I love this and this.&quot; And I look at it like a befuddled child looking at Algebra. I get the words and I know there&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;m supposed to be looking for and I... it&#x2019;s embarrassing. It makes you feel stupid.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Joking about his acting method</strong>: There was one minor thing that happened when I was younger that I used to inform the Cain character [in <em>Year One</em>]. The director didn&#x2019;t even know about this at the time I was cast, but I did kill my brother. I beat him over the head until he was unconscious, then I buried him up to his head&#x2014;but I did it the other way, head first, up to his neck basically. And then I just scribbled on him with a sharpie until he died!</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>On his banjo</strong>: I like banjo music. I was given a banjo as a gift from the producers of <em>Todd Margaret.</em> I&#x2019;d told them I loved Earl Scruggs. We&#x2019;d get drunk and imitate the banjo sound with our mouths, and they&#x2019;d make fun of me for being a hick. Then they gave me that banjo and I started taking lessons. It&#x2019;s really hard.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>On inheritances from his British father</strong>: My teeth are bucked out. But I never thought about my penchant for liking rainy, cooler overcast weather and drinking beer. My birthday dinner when I was a kid was fish and chips, at Arthur Treacher&#x2019;s. I loved Monty Python. The Who was my favorite band. I was such an Anglophile. And all these little things made sense later. Except the cannabalism.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>On being disillusioned with politics</strong>: It&#x2019;s pathetic that we&#x2019;re applauding that a president mentions gay rights in 2013. That that&#x2019;s some sort of accomplishment is sad to me. I feel really bad for people who were like myself twenty years ago, who really bought into hope and go, &quot;Things are going to be great now! We&#x2019;re going to lead the world in tolerance, and freedom, and progressive ideals, and equality, and justice.&quot; And of course that didn&#x2019;t happen. We&#x2019;re a business. It&#x2019;s not being jaded or cynical to state the obvious: that all politicians have to lie. You can&#x2019;t appeal to a hundred and fifty million Americans and not lie to get everyone on your side.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>On money</strong>: The biggest payday I ever got was for the <em>Alvin and the Chipmunks</em> movie. I didn&#x2019;t get paid much for the first one, but I was contractually obligated to do the following. Nobody ever thought there would be three movies, not even the studio. I hadn&#x2019;t worked in six months, which was starting to drive me crazy and I was like, <em>Yeah, fuck it, I want work</em>. So I did it. I didn&#x2019;t get much money at first, but I got money in bonuses because it did so well. And then the second movie I did, I got more. And after doing the third one I thought, <em>Shit, well, I&#x2019;m set</em>. I&#x2019;ve got <em>Chipmunks money</em>! And it allowed me to go to London and make <em>Todd Margaret</em> at a loss.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>On the future of television</strong>: When you say <em>online,</em> that connotes computers, but I watch NetFlix on my TV. Yes, through a computer, but it doesn&#x2019;t feel online. Nobody really cares. They just want to go click their button and it comes up on their TV screen. No matter what cable it&#x2019;s going through, it&#x2019;s on TV. Whether it&#x2019;s NetFlix or Stars or Showtime or NBC or Wii, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. Even if it&#x2019;s YouTube through the fucking TV, AppleTV, whatever it is, that&#x2019;s TV.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>On his level of fame</strong>: There are hardcore comedy fans who have known about me for 20 years, and people who don&#x2019;t know about <em>Mr. Show</em> but know <em>Arrested Development </em>and the time I was on Conan and wore something silly. But for most, I&#x2019;m just &quot;That Guy!&quot; When I went through the TSA line recently, this one guy was like, <em>Oh hey, oh shit, yo yo, that&#x2019;s the actor... who you from, where you with, who did you do? No, I know what it was, it was, what was it? You was in </em>Scream<em>, right? Was you in </em>Scream<em>?</em> Shit like that. I&#x2019;ll never be the dude with the security detail. Nature has leveled it all out for me. I&#x2019;m never going to be Captain America.</p><p data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>On owning jean shorts</strong>: I don&#x2019;t. But I have very nice calves. Often remarked upon, in fact. I do a lot of walking, a lot of biking. I&#x2019;m very active in the leg department. My wife says my legs are my best physical attribute.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".2d7wule40zk.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col
