  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI know how it looks, but cross my heart, there was no place else for me to sit.\u000A\u000AMy name card had an assigned table, and my assigned table had just one spot left, right next to a stranger I happened to recognize. Actually, that\u0027s underselling it. When I realized who it was, I U-turned and walked to an empty corner of the restaurant, where I mumbled gratitudes near a plant.\u000A\u000AThis was during a moment, a space of a few weeks last November, when Emily Ratajkowski had gone mass. \u0022Blurred Lines,\u0022 the Robin Thicke song and video with which she\u0027d announced herself to the planet, had sealed its slot as the tune of 2013; as a direct result, she\u0027d been cast in David Fincher\u0027s Gone Girl. What Fincher saw in Emily (besides the obvious) was what everyone saw: a hammy sense of self-possession that upstaged the other models and musicians in the video, creating this iris effect that pretty much forced you to zero in on her. For the rest of the year, all 97 billion times that \u0022Blurred Lines\u0022 played on KIIS-FM or in RadioShack or during a ballplayer\u0027s stroll to the plate, it was Emily who popped into mind. It\u0027s a weird thing, though, getting famous this way—\u0022associated with a song,\u0022 she would later tell me, \u0022that I didn\u0027t write or sing. A song I\u0027m going to deal with for the rest of my life, even though the video was a one-day job.\u0022\u000A\u000AAt the dinner, Emily was wearing a black dress, and her mouth had the bright, clear-coat finish of a sports car. She talked with a couple of other models for the early part of the meal, and the first thing I heard her say was: \u0022Oh, my God, you are such a Gemini!\u0022\u000A\u000ARight. A beauty on the outside but an astrologer deep down. At a lull, I floated the name of a mutual friend. She seemed not miffed to have to talk to me about this friend. And so we got into other things. Mostly related to the California she grew up in, a few years later and two hours south of the California I grew up in. Her voice—\u0022totally,\u0022 \u0022oh, fer sure,\u0022 \u0022chillest,\u0022 \u0022trip me out,\u0022 \u0022gnarly,\u0022 \u0022duh!\u0022—was low and easy, coming at half-speed playback, sorta like a Laguna Beach character before she joined The Hills.\u000A\u000ABut then: \u0022Have you seen Blue Jasmine yet? Most people I know hated it, but I loved it. I feel like, in Cate, he finally found the right vessel for his neuroses.\u0022 And: \u0022Let me tell you why The Corrections is a better book than Freedom.\u0022 And: \u0022I\u0027m trying out a bunch of Bola&amp;#xF1;o. I always feel weird reading stuff that I know has been translated, but it seems to flow pretty well, pretty authentically.\u0022\u000A\u000AWas it unfair to expect otherwise? Oh, probably. Psychologists call that False Assumptions About Women You\u0027ve Seen Super-Naked Before You Talk to Them in Person. By the time I found myself lying about having read some recent New Yorker short story she liked, whatever surprise I experienced at the outset had faded.\u000A\u000AThe whole situation was very amusing to other people I knew at the dinner. The next day, there emerged some surreptitiously taken photos of me next to Emily—me doing my hilarious impression of nasally SoCal surfers, she squinting with skepticism—that capture nicely what it looks like to be drowning in the deep end.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe small house she grew up in is on a hill across from the ocean, all salt-eaten siding and half-size rooms, probably 900 square feet if you don\u0027t count the converted shed out back she moved into when she turned 15. \u0022Until then, I shared a wall with my parents,\u0022 she says. \u0022Which would\u0027ve been okay if my dad hadn\u0027t ripped the ceiling out to expose the beams.\u0022 The walls still cut off at eight feet and give the house the feeling of a diorama. \u0022So I spent a lot of time with headphones on. They knew I was getting a text even when my phone was on silent, because it\u0027d light up the house.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not many steps from one end of the house to the other, so we end up out back, among bougainvillea and Dad\u0027s art, where she describes how comfortable she was growing up here in San Diego. (This still throws people: \u0022Because of my name and my look, it\u0027s sometimes: \u0027Wow, I expected broken English or a British accent.\u0027 \u0022) Dad, a painter, taught art at a high school in Encinitas, and Mom, an English professor, commuted up the coast to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. When it came time for high school, her parents encouraged her to opt out of the massive, wealthy public school \u0022where they had football\u0022 and instead go to the smaller, magnet school where her father taught. \u0022My dad had a cool rep. But it was a little overwhelming when, like, \u0027Do you think Mr. Rata smokes weed?\u0027 became \u0027What about Rata\u0027s hot daughter?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AEmily enrolled at UCLA with plans to paint—and to pay for her tuition with modeling checks. Her roommates were five blondes bent on joining sororities. \u0022The day we moved in,\u0022 she says, \u0022one of them asked, \u0027Oh, are you rushing?\u0027 And my dad said, \u0027Um, no, we\u0027re Polish.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AShe didn\u0027t love her program, and as the modeling opportunities kept coming, she spent more and more time away from the classroom. \u0022I wouldn\u0027t say it was for a shoot, but I\u0027d be like, \u0027Later! Going to Puerto Rico for a week,\u0027 \u0022 she recalls. \u0022My professors hated me.\u0022 She dropped out after a year, rented an apartment in downtown L.A., and strung together the sorts of jobs you can only call stepping-stones once you know the destination is a Fincher movie. Sauce-heavy Carl\u0027s Jr. ads. Top- and bottomless black-and-whites for L.A. \u0022art\u0022 mags. In January 2013, she got a call about a music video.\u000A\u000A\u0022I didn\u0027t want to do it at first, but I talked to the director and I understood what it was,\u0022 she says. I ask if she even likes the song. \u0022I do like it. But if there\u0027s one thing I\u0027d request, it\u0027s for people who see me out to not be, like, You\u0027re the hottest bitch in this place. When it comes on in a bar, I run into the bathroom and hide.\u0022\u000A\u000ALast September she heard from a casting director for Gone Girl, David Fincher\u0027s adaptation of Gillian Flynn\u0027s best-selling thriller. \u0022I was talking with Ben [Affleck], and what I wanted for the Andie role was someone who could be incredibly divisive among men and women in the audience,\u0022 Fincher says. Andie is the writing student and mistress of Affleck\u0027s character, Nick, who calls her \u0022an alien fuck-doll of a girl...as different from my elegant, patrician wife as could be.\u0022\u000A\u000AFincher continues, \u0022We needed somebody where, at the moment she appears, the women are going, \u0027That is unconscionable and despicable.\u0027 And you also have the men going, \u0027Yes, but...\u0027 And so Ben said, \u0027Yeah, like the girl in the \u0022Blurred Lines\u0022 video.\u0027 \u0022 Let it be noted that Affleck handpicked the woman with whom he\u0027d endure Fincher\u0027s \u0022several dozen takes\u0022 of make-out sessions. \u0022She was just incredibly mature,\u0022 Fincher says. \u0022She wasn\u0027t smitten with being the girl of the moment. She\u0027s no bullshit. If somebody\u0027s gonna ruin their life on a 21-year-old, they have to be special, and she was.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe casting opened up all sorts of lines. Good enough for Fincher means good enough for, say, the upcoming Entourage movie. \u0022That show\u0027s always been so funny to me,\u0022 she says. \u0022I\u0027m playing myself, and they\u0027ve got me in an Aston Martin. I drive a Nissan Versa and would never spend real money on a car, because I destroy things. So there\u0027s this weird version of yourself. Hollywood fetishizing you and itself—this box within a box. There is winter in L.A., there is rain in L.A. But there is no rain on Entourage.\u0022 After wrapping up at the house, we drive down to the water and through Encinitas—the last of the beach towns, she calls it, \u0022even though there\u0027s a Whole Foods on 101 now.\u0022 Couples pedal beach cruisers from one margarita to the next; hot rods run the main drag. A \u0022self-realization center,\u0022 where Emily\u0027s dad used to pick up babes back in his bachelor days, cuts a figure like a Vegas Taj Mahal on the southern edge of town.\u000A\u000AWe head to the beach—the \u0022secret, un-touristy, un-douche beach\u0022 called Stonesteps. There are in fact stone steps, hundreds of them, in a sort of Escher zag up the cliffside. Guys charging up and down steal glimpses of the slinky cotton dress Emily\u0027s black moto jacket struggles to conceal. We sit at the top with a killer panorama of the water, and I ask her what a photographer might say about why her pictures work. \u0022I think it was Mario Testino who said when you look at a photo of Kate Moss, you feel like you\u0027re looking at a real person. And that\u0027s something that I hope would come through in my photos, maybe more than what you would see in another model.\u0022\u000A\u000AI like Emily a lot, which is probably why I don\u0027t call her on this line at the time, but her real-personhood is not what makes her a model worth shooting. It is, though, what might make her a former model, if things work out—poly-famous, with acting credits, nice pictures, and a textured personality. To that last point, one cool thing about Emily is that she is a wildly thoughtful reader with catholic interests. In conversation, she\u0027s always dipping into something about David Mitchell, Lorrie Moore, George Saunders, Denis Johnson, Rebecca Lee, Wells Tower (\u0022I think Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned might be a perfect book\u0022), and the pleasing, intuitive layout of the McNally Jackson bookstore in New York\u0027s Nolita neighborhood.\u000A\u000AI tell her that something she said earlier is a \u0022cred\u0022 opinion among book snobs. \u0022Oh yeah? That\u0027s cool, I guess. Also a little obnoxious that there\u0027s something you\u0027re \u0027supposed\u0027 to think.\u0022 I\u0027m more into this response than even her cred opinions about David Mitchell. Later, a female friend calls me out for being so in the tank: \u0022Don\u0027t you think that she was just playing you with that shit?\u0022 I defend Emily until I sound inarguably played but then recognize that it\u0027d be even cooler if she spent her time manipulatively reading.\u000A\u000AAs sunset approaches, people from the neighborhood show up with sippy cups. A man stands near us with a dog swaddled in a Boba Wrap. The guy running the stairs passes us one last time and takes a final, leisurely look at Emily. \u0022Not a bad place to grow up,\u0022 she says. \u0022I guess this is why people never leave.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AEmily is newly single. \u0022Generally, I just think there is a real lacking in men knowing how to hit on women. I have this whole running joke with someone: What Would Denzel Do? Like, you don\u0027t think about how many days you should wait to call the girl—you just do it when you want. Fuckin\u0027 Denzel. You do what you want, you know what you want.\u0022\u000A\u000AOn an obstinately cold spring night in New York City, we head to a bar in the East Village. Emily\u0027s buttoned up and tucked in a corner, so she doesn\u0027t draw much attention. She\u0027s a double-digit exponent of good-lookingness, but shorter than you\u0027d expect—doesn\u0027t eat up a door frame the way Gisele probably does. We cover some new stuff.\u000A\u000AArtist scandals: \u0022With R. Kelly, he actually makes work about fucking underage girls. Everyone else, separate the fucking work from the artist.\u0022 Presidential scandals: \u0022What would happen if Obama had an affair like Clinton\u0027s? \u0027Cause I feel like he has, like, a sexy quality to him that a lot of presidents don\u0027t.\u0022 The decline of Europe: \u0022I\u0027ve spent so much time there, and I love it, but I feel like it\u0027s such an insignificant part of the world now. The population\u0027s decreasing; it\u0027s doing the same thing it\u0027s been doing for a long time. Economically, it\u0027s fucked.\u0022\u000A\u000AI ask her what she\u0027d be doing if she weren\u0027t tied up with our interview. Probably karaoke and then this favorite place of hers, Paul\u0027s Baby Grand. It\u0027s like a rough draft of an SNL Stefon sketch. Topiary maze. Lawn jockeys. Tiny South Asian servers in matching white jackets and bow ties. The owner, Paul Sevigny, describes his \u0022dream customer\u0022 as \u0022a 75-year-old gay black European.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Bars are bad,\u0022 Emily says, meaning it\u0027s been tough for her to go out recently. \u0022Generally, people don\u0027t want to be embarrassing. But when there\u0027s alcohol involved and group mentality, it can be a little weird. Guys will say, \u0027You know who you look like...,\u0027 and then word spreads. Or guys do this thing where they go, \u0027I would love to take a picture of you for my friend.\u0027 And then they get out their phone and their hand\u0027s shaking, and I\u0027m like, \u0027You\u0027re taking this for your friend? I thought you didn\u0027t care.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AFrance, she says, is especially rough: \u0022I don\u0027t know what it is, but French men love me. The crowds are terrifying. We went out one night a couple of months ago to Le Titty Twister, and there was a crowd situation.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a different complication with women. Even when she\u0027s willfully invisible, in her \u0022worst, hungover state,\u0022 she says, \u0022they\u0027ll come up and be like, \u0027You\u0027re beautiful in person,\u0027 and I just find that so weird. I mean, I\u0027m appreciative. It\u0027s just a strange thing, because I guess the ideal way to be acknowledged is if you\u0027re, like, Patti Smith: \u0027I love your work.\u0027 And sometimes women will say that, but it\u0027s awkward, because they\u0027re not saying that at all. What they\u0027re really saying is: I like your pictures. I really like that music video you\u0027re in.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt would be career-poisoning for Emily to suggest that she\u0027s anything but grateful for her modeling work. She\u0027s committed to it and exceedingly count-on-able. But—and this is all me, probably extrapolating too much from things that weren\u0027t said—you can also imagine a version of the story in which \u0022the work\u0022 just gets kind of boring. Where Emily becomes an actress, sure, but maybe even a teacher or a painter, in a bungalow with the ceilings ripped out. In the moment, though, we\u0027re still talking about the short term.\u000A\u000A\u0022And so hopefully, at a certain point, people will be coming up to me and saying, \u0027I really like your acting.\u0027 Or better, \u0027I like whatever you had to say.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Daniel Riley (@danielvriley)  is GQ\u0027s senior associate editor.",

looks, but cross my heart, there was no place else for me to sit.</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.2">My name card had an assigned table, and my assigned table had just one spot left, right next to a stranger I happened to recognize. Actually, that&#x2019;s underselling it. When I realized who it was, I U-turned and walked to an empty corner of the restaurant, where I mumbled gratitudes near a plant.</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.3">This was during a moment, a space of a few weeks last November, when Emily Ratajkowski had gone mass. &quot;Blurred Lines,&quot; the Robin Thicke song and video with which she&#x2019;d announced herself to the planet, had sealed its slot as the tune of 2013; as a direct result, she&#x2019;d been cast in David Fincher&#x2019;s <em>Gone Girl.</em> What Fincher saw in Emily (besides the obvious) was what everyone saw: a hammy sense of self-possession that upstaged the other models and musicians in the video, creating this iris effect that pretty much forced you to zero in on her. For the rest of the year, all 97 billion times that &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; played on KIIS-FM or in RadioShack or during a ballplayer&#x2019;s stroll to the plate, it was Emily who popped into mind. It&#x2019;s a weird thing, though, getting famous this way&#x2014;&quot;associated with a song,&quot; she would later tell me, &quot;that I didn&#x2019;t write or sing. A song I&#x2019;m going to deal with for the rest of my life, even though the video was a one-day job.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.5">At the dinner, Emily was wearing a black dress, and her mouth had the bright, clear-coat finish of a sports car. She talked with a couple of other models for the early part of the meal, and the first thing I heard her say was: &quot;Oh, my God, you are <em>such</em> a Gemini!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.6">Right. A beauty on the outside but an astrologer deep down. At a lull, I floated the name of a mutual friend. She seemed not miffed to have to talk to me about this friend. And so we got into other things. Mostly related to the California she grew up in, a few years later and two hours south of the California I grew up in. Her voice&#x2014;<em>&quot;totally,&quot;</em> &quot;oh, fer sure,&quot; &quot;chillest,&quot; &quot;trip me out,&quot; &quot;gnarly,&quot; &quot;duh!&quot;&#x2014;was low and easy, coming at half-speed playback, sorta like a <em>Laguna Beach</em> character before she joined <em>The Hills.</em></p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.7">But then: &quot;Have you seen <em>Blue Jasmine</em> yet? Most people I know hated it, but I loved it. I feel like, in Cate, he finally found the right vessel for his neuroses.&quot; And: &quot;Let me tell you why <em>The Corrections</em> is a better book than <em>Freedom.</em>&quot; And: &quot;I&#x2019;m trying out a bunch of Bola&amp;#xF1;o. I always feel weird reading stuff that I know has been translated, but it seems to flow pretty well, pretty authentically.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.8">Was it unfair to expect otherwise? Oh, probably. Psychologists call that False Assumptions About Women You&#x2019;ve Seen Super-Naked Before You Talk to Them in Person. By the time I found myself lying about having read some recent <em>New Yorker</em> short story she liked, whatever surprise I experienced at the outset had faded.</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.9">The whole situation was very amusing to other people I knew at the dinner. The next day, there emerged some surreptitiously taken photos of me next to Emily&#x2014;me doing my hilarious impression of nasally SoCal surfers, she squinting with skepticism&#x2014;that capture nicely what it looks like to be drowning in the deep end.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.a"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c8fd1177d66d68d5881d/master/w_806/women-2014-07-emily-ratajkowski-emily-1.gif" alt="women-2014-07-emily-ratajkowski-emily-1.gif"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Femily-ratajkowski&amp;t=women-2014-07-emily-ratajkowski-emily-1.gif"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Femily-ratajkowski&amp;t=women-2014-07-emily-ratajkowski-emily-1.gif" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Femily-ratajkowski&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c8fd1177d66d68d5881d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fwomen-2014-07-emily-ratajkowski-emily-1.gif&amp;description=women-2014-07-emily-ratajkowski-emily-1.gif"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Femily-ratajkowski&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c8fd1177d66d68d5881d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fwomen-2014-07-emily-ratajkowski-emily-1.gif&amp;description=women-2014-07-emily-ratajkowski-emily-1.gif" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.b"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.c">The small house she grew up in is on a hill across from the ocean, all salt-eaten siding and half-size rooms, probably 900 square feet if you don&#x2019;t count the converted shed out back she moved into when she turned 15. &quot;Until then, I shared a wall with my parents,&quot; she says. &quot;Which would&#x2019;ve been okay if my dad hadn&#x2019;t ripped the ceiling out to expose the beams.&quot; The walls still cut off at eight feet and give the house the feeling of a diorama. &quot;So I spent a lot of time with headphones on. They knew I was getting a text even when my phone was on silent, because it&#x2019;d light up the house.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.d">It&#x2019;s not many steps from one end of the house to the other, so we end up out back, among bougainvillea and Dad&#x2019;s art, where she describes how comfortable she was growing up here in San Diego. (This still throws people: &quot;Because of my name and my look, it&#x2019;s sometimes: &#x2019;Wow, I expected broken English or a British accent.&#x2019; &quot;) Dad, a painter, taught art at a high school in Encinitas, and Mom, an English professor, commuted up the coast to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. When it came time for high school, her parents encouraged her to opt out of the massive, wealthy public school &quot;where they had football&quot; and instead go to the smaller, magnet school where her father taught. &quot;My dad had a cool rep. But it was a little overwhelming when, like, &#x2019;Do you think Mr. Rata smokes weed?&#x2019; became &#x2019;What about Rata&#x2019;s hot daughter?&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.e">Emily enrolled at UCLA with plans to paint&#x2014;and to pay for her tuition with modeling checks. Her roommates were five blondes bent on joining sororities. &quot;The day we moved in,&quot; she says, &quot;one of them asked, &#x2019;Oh, are you rushing?&#x2019; And my dad said, &#x2019;Um, no, we&#x2019;re Polish.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.f">She didn&#x2019;t love her program, and as the modeling opportunities kept coming, she spent more and more time away from the classroom. &quot;I wouldn&#x2019;t say it was for a shoot, but I&#x2019;d be like, &#x2019;Later! Going to Puerto Rico for a week,&#x2019; &quot; she recalls. &quot;My professors <em>hated</em> me.&quot; She dropped out after a year, rented an apartment in downtown L.A., and strung together the sorts of jobs you can only call stepping-stones once you know the destination is a Fincher movie. Sauce-heavy Carl&#x2019;s Jr. ads. Top- and bottomless black-and-whites for L.A. &quot;art&quot; mags. In January 2013, she got a call about a music video.</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.g">&quot;I didn&#x2019;t want to do it at first, but I talked to the director and I understood what it was,&quot; she says. I ask if she even likes the song. &quot;I <em>do</em> like it. But if there&#x2019;s one thing I&#x2019;d request, it&#x2019;s for people who see me out to not be, like, <em>You&#x2019;re the hottest bitch in this place.</em> When it comes on in a bar, I run into the bathroom and hide.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.h">Last September she heard from a casting director for <em>Gone Girl,</em> David Fincher&#x2019;s adaptation of Gillian Flynn&#x2019;s best-selling thriller. &quot;I was talking with Ben [Affleck], and what I wanted for the Andie role was someone who could be incredibly divisive among men and women in the audience,&quot; Fincher says. Andie is the writing student and mistress of Affleck&#x2019;s character, Nick, who calls her &quot;an alien fuck-doll of a girl...as different from my elegant, patrician wife as could be.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.i">Fincher continues, &quot;We needed somebody where, at the moment she appears, the women are going, &#x2019;That is unconscionable and despicable.&#x2019; And you also have the men going, &#x2019;Yes, <em>but...</em>&#x2019; And so Ben said, &#x2019;Yeah, like the girl in the &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; video.&#x2019; &quot; Let it be noted that Affleck handpicked the woman with whom he&#x2019;d endure Fincher&#x2019;s &quot;several dozen takes&quot; of make-out sessions. &quot;She was just incredibly mature,&quot; Fincher says. &quot;She wasn&#x2019;t smitten with being the girl of the moment. She&#x2019;s no bullshit. If somebody&#x2019;s gonna ruin their life on a 21-year-old, they have to be special, and she was.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.j">The casting opened up all sorts of lines. Good enough for Fincher means good enough for, say, the upcoming <em>Entourage</em> movie. &quot;That show&#x2019;s always been so funny to me,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#x2019;m playing myself, and they&#x2019;ve got me in an Aston Martin. I drive a Nissan Versa and would never spend real money on a car, because I destroy things. So there&#x2019;s this weird version of yourself. Hollywood fetishizing you and itself&#x2014;this box within a box. There is winter in L.A., there is rain in L.A. But there is no rain on <em>Entourage.</em>&quot; After wrapping up at the house, we drive down to the water and through Encinitas&#x2014;the last of the beach towns, she calls it, &quot;even though there&#x2019;s a Whole Foods on 101 now.&quot; Couples pedal beach cruisers from one margarita to the next; hot rods run the main drag. A &quot;self-realization center,&quot; where Emily&#x2019;s dad used to pick up babes back in his bachelor days, cuts a figure like a Vegas Taj Mahal on the southern edge of town.</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.k">We head to the beach&#x2014;the &quot;secret, un-touristy, un-douche beach&quot; called Stonesteps. There are in fact stone steps, hundreds of them, in a sort of Escher zag up the cliffside. Guys charging up and down steal glimpses of the slinky cotton dress Emily&#x2019;s black moto jacket struggles to conceal. We sit at the top with a killer panorama of the water, and I ask her what a photographer might say about why her pictures work. &quot;I think it was Mario Testino who said when you look at a photo of Kate Moss, you feel like you&#x2019;re looking at a real person. And that&#x2019;s something that I hope would come through in my photos, maybe more than what you would see in another model.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.l">I like Emily a lot, which is probably why I don&#x2019;t call her on this line at the time, but her real-personhood is not what makes her a model worth shooting. It is, though, what might make her a <em>former</em> model, if things work out&#x2014;poly-famous, with acting credits, nice pictures, and a textured personality. To that last point, one cool thing about Emily is that she is a wildly thoughtful reader with catholic interests. In conversation, she&#x2019;s always dipping into something about David Mitchell, Lorrie Moore, George Saunders, Denis Johnson, Rebecca Lee, Wells Tower (&quot;I think <em>Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned</em> might be a perfect book&quot;), and the pleasing, intuitive layout of the McNally Jackson bookstore in New York&#x2019;s Nolita neighborhood.</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.m">I tell her that something she said earlier is a &quot;cred&quot; opinion among book snobs. &quot;Oh yeah? That&#x2019;s cool, I guess. Also a little obnoxious that there&#x2019;s something you&#x2019;re &#x2019;supposed&#x2019; to think.&quot; I&#x2019;m more into this response than even her cred opinions about David Mitchell. Later, a female friend calls me out for being so in the tank: &quot;Don&#x2019;t you think that she was just playing you with that shit?&quot; I defend Emily until I sound inarguably played but then recognize that it&#x2019;d be even cooler if she spent her time <em>manipulatively reading.</em></p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.n">As sunset approaches, people from the neighborhood show up with sippy cups. A man stands near us with a dog swaddled in a Boba Wrap. The guy running the stairs passes us one last time and takes a final, leisurely look at Emily. &quot;Not a bad place to grow up,&quot; she says. &quot;I guess this is why people never leave.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.o"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.p">Emily is newly single. &quot;Generally, I just think there is a real lacking in men knowing how to hit on women. I have this whole running joke with someone: What Would Denzel Do? Like, you don&#x2019;t think about how many days you should wait to call the girl&#x2014;you just do it when you want. Fuckin&#x2019; Denzel. You do what you want, you know what you want.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.q">On an obstinately cold spring night in New York City, we head to a bar in the East Village. Emily&#x2019;s buttoned up and tucked in a corner, so she doesn&#x2019;t draw much attention. She&#x2019;s a double-digit exponent of good-lookingness, but shorter than you&#x2019;d expect&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t eat up a door frame the way Gisele probably does. We cover some new stuff.</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.r">Artist scandals: &quot;With R. Kelly, he actually makes <em>work</em> about fucking underage girls. Everyone else, separate the fucking work from the artist.&quot; Presidential scandals: &quot;What would happen if Obama had an affair like Clinton&#x2019;s? &#x2019;Cause I feel like he has, like, a sexy quality to him that a lot of presidents don&#x2019;t.&quot; The decline of Europe: &quot;I&#x2019;ve spent so much time there, and I love it, but I feel like it&#x2019;s such an insignificant part of the world now. The population&#x2019;s decreasing; it&#x2019;s doing the same thing it&#x2019;s been doing for a long time. Economically, it&#x2019;s fucked.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.s">I ask her what she&#x2019;d be doing if she weren&#x2019;t tied up with our interview. Probably karaoke and then this favorite place of hers, Paul&#x2019;s Baby Grand. It&#x2019;s like a rough draft of an <em>SNL</em> Stefon sketch. Topiary maze. Lawn jockeys. Tiny South Asian servers in matching white jackets and bow ties. The owner, Paul Sevigny, describes his &quot;dream customer&quot; as &quot;a 75-year-old gay black European.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.t">&quot;Bars are bad,&quot; Emily says, meaning it&#x2019;s been tough for her to go out recently. &quot;Generally, people don&#x2019;t want to be embarrassing. But when there&#x2019;s alcohol involved and group mentality, it can be a little weird. Guys will say, &#x2019;You know who you look like...,&#x2019; and then word spreads. Or guys do this thing where they go, &#x2019;I would love to take a picture of you for my friend.&#x2019; And then they get out their phone and their hand&#x2019;s shaking, and I&#x2019;m like, &#x2019;You&#x2019;re taking this for your friend? I thought you didn&#x2019;t care.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.u">France, she says, is especially rough: &quot;I don&#x2019;t know what it is, but French men love me. The crowds are terrifying. We went out one night a couple of months ago to Le Titty Twister, and there was a crowd situation.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.v">It&#x2019;s a different complication with women. Even when she&#x2019;s willfully invisible, in her &quot;worst, hungover state,&quot; she says, &quot;they&#x2019;ll come up and be like, &#x2019;You&#x2019;re <em>beautiful</em> in person,&#x2019; and I just find that so weird. I mean, I&#x2019;m appreciative. It&#x2019;s just a strange thing, because I guess the ideal way to be acknowledged is if you&#x2019;re, like, Patti Smith: &#x2019;I love your <em>work.</em>&#x2019; And sometimes women will say that, but it&#x2019;s awkward, because they&#x2019;re not saying that at all. What they&#x2019;re really saying is: I like your <em>pictures.</em> I really like that <em>music video</em> you&#x2019;re in.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.w">It would be career-poisoning for Emily to suggest that she&#x2019;s anything but grateful for her modeling work. She&#x2019;s committed to it and exceedingly count-on-able. But&#x2014;and this is all me, probably extrapolating too much from things that weren&#x2019;t said&#x2014;you can also imagine a version of the story in which &quot;the work&quot; just gets kind of boring. Where Emily becomes an actress, sure, but maybe even a teacher or a painter, in a bungalow with the ceilings ripped out. In the moment, though, we&#x2019;re still talking about the short term.</p><p data-reactid=".2gawvucy4n4.1.1.0.0.4.x">&quot;And so hopefully, at a certain point, people will be coming up to me and saying, &#x2019;I really like your acting.&#x2019; Or better, &#x2019;I like whatever you had to <em>say.</em>&#x2019; &quot;</p><div class="embed image"
