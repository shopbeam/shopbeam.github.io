  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABeing a food writer at\u000A\u000AGQ is a tough job. Really. So much eating and drinking, all with your best interests—never their own—in mind. And yet what thanks do these poor, overfed men get? Well, for one, the satisfaction of knowing who is the best. After we read that dinner for two at Alain Ducasse costs almost $900, we gave Alan Richman, Adam Sachs and Adam Rapoport $2,000 each to create the meal of their dreams. The rules were simple: They could travel anywhere in the world, eat anything in the world and bring as many guests as they wanted—so long as they did not spend more than their allotted $2,000.\u000A\u000A_\u000A\u000AWe departed New York early on the morning of the meal—me, two friends and a sack of doughnuts. They insisted I buy both the Bavarian and vanilla kremes, which seemed excessive, but I\u0027d told them they could have anything they wanted until the money ran out. Ahead of us was a 400-mile drive to Montreal and my promise of the most exquisite dinner of our lives. At the very least, it would be the most expensive. I\u0027d planned everything with meticulous care, but I still wasn\u0027t certain of success. After all, I was in search of perfection, which is something not easily prearranged. I\u0027d always known that someday I\u0027d have a meal that I would forever call the best of my life, but I thought it would be an accident, the luck of the road. I imagined it taking place in Italy or France and going something like this:\u000A\u000AAn unpaved, twisting detour would bring me to an unmapped hilltop town near Orvieto, where I\u0027d find a tiny trattoria surrounded by trees heavy with olives, and I\u0027d sit on the terra-cotta patio sipping red wine made by the proprietor that he sold by the carafe for almost nothing even though it had the bouquet of a Bruno Giacosa Barbaresco, and the sun slanting through the low drifting clouds would turn the mist the color of a burnished Roman shield, and the proprietor\u0027s daughter would ask, in an Umbrian dialect unknown to me but somehow understandable, \u0022Would you honor us by trying the tortellini my great-grandmother made this morning?\u0022 Or I\u0027d stop for a simple prix fi lunch at a French villa built by a count in the seventeenth century for his mistress, and the chèvre brought to my table by the Cordon Bleu-trained staff would have the flavor of wild thyme eaten by goats living in the mountains, and I\u0027d open the wine list and there it would be, the 1929 La Tâche I\u0027d dreamed of all my life, only 120 francs, and the aging sommelier would thank me profusely, explaining that clients of my discernment came all too rarely to this forgotten lake that rippled whenever the soft breezes from the Pyrenees stirred the water lilies.\u000A\u000AI didn\u0027t expect to be in a car with a couple of guys, eating doughnuts and headed for Canada.\u000A\u000AI had $2,000, and money can buy a lot when it comes to groceries, but I wanted the meal to be more than merely long and expensive. I wanted it to resonate with history. That\u0027s why I decided to duplicate a dining experience I\u0027d always regretted not having, a Michelin-style road trip. About a half century ago, which was slightly before my time, French epicures would visit the great restaurants of their country by automobile, staying in the most unostentatious accommodations imaginable, rooms without private baths on the floors above the restaurants where they ate. Their goal was to spend money on not much else besides dinner, because they had little wealth, and food and wine were all they cared about. They were the first foodies obsessed by the Michelin guide, with its famous (and now largely ignored) definitions of two- and three-star restaurants as being worth a detour or a special trip. These days, of course, three-star French restaurants are gilded Vegas palaces, where German industrialists arrive by helicopter and insist on marble-clad suites.\u000A\u000AI wanted to return to a time when dining was a purer and more focused experience. To that end, I chose as my destination the restaurant-bakery Le Passe-Partout in Montreal. Seating only about thirty, located a few miles from the center of the city and operated by an autocratic (but kindly) French-trained former New Yorker named James MacGuire, Le Passe-Partout reminds me of a perfectly correct neighborhood French restaurant. Although open for only twenty years and at its present location for less than ten, it seems precisely of the era I sought to re-create. MacGuire, who is 50, cooks French classics as well as any chef I know. He does not interpret them. He does not seek to improve upon them. He says of chefs who do, \u0022I think it is inadmissible to make customers pay for your experiments.\u0022 Le Passe-Partout is open for lunch only two days a week and for dinner on just three, which meant I could select from among a bevy of off days to book the entire place for my friends and me. For my $2,000 meal, I did not particularly want strangers in the room.\u000A\u000AThe driver of the car was a friend who has accompanied me on a number of dining trips, a big-shot New York lawyer who can eat as much as any man alive, providing his wife is not present to monitor him. Shortly after we set out, he made it clear to me that while the meal I had planned might be the most costly of my life, it was no record breaker for him. The second friend in the car was a kindhearted fellow who has no formal cooking training whatsoever yet attempts every to have a look but declined to taste it, explaining, \u0022The smell\u0027s got me whupped.\u0022 Lunch, with a generous tip, added $35 more to the cost of the trip. Not only was the meal a success; we had divested ourselves of the truffle before reaching the Canadian border and having to explain the odor in our car to distrustful customs officials.\u000A\u000ADinner was scheduled for 7:30 P.M., and we were on time, although it was unnecessary, since the entire restaurant was ours for the night. MacGuire had chosen a table in the center of the peach-pink room and obtained the services of a renowned sommelier, Don-Jean Léandri, who had directed the wine service at the wedding of Celine Dion. Our waitress was a willowy, blond university student with the irresistible name of Sarah-Maya Côté-Jirik, an Uma Thurman look-alike who works in restaurants part-time. She told us she was studying sociology at the University of Montreal, which I found admirable, because any woman living in the United States who looks like her would choose modeling, not higher education, as a pursuit. Boone, ever the correct Canadian, arrived in a tie, but the rest of us dressed less formally, yet another advantage of booking the whole place. We took our damask-covered chairs, and Boone set the conversational tone for the evening while we sipped 1989 Veuve Clicquot Le Grand Dame Rosé Champagne, which was magnificent, and nibbled canapés of foie gras, salmon smoked over alder chips, and caviar from sturgeon caught in the St. Lawrence River. He regaled us with stories of the late Little Beaver, the greatest midget wrestler in the history of Montreal, whose battles with arch foe Fuzzy Cupid are epic. \u0022Little Beaver was a four-foot-four French Canadian from Montreal who had a Mohawk haircut before it became fashionable, which was after James Fenimore Cooper and before Johnny Rotten,\u0022 Boone said. \u0022When things weren\u0027t going well, when Fuzzy Cupid was having his way with him, Little Beaver would throw his moccasins at the referee, which I believe was an early sign of defiance against authority figures who had oppressed the Indians, even if he wasn\u0027t really an Indian.\u0022 I could have listened all night, for Boone\u0027s storytelling was in the classic narrative style practiced by Montrealers snowed in for the winter in the days before global warming ruined the essential nature of Canadian life. My friend the amateur chef mentioned that such a convivial moment was possible only because of the absence of our wives, who would not have tolerated such a rousing, red-blooded tale. He said, \u0022My wife would be pretending she was interested in the story, but then when she thought we weren\u0027t looking, she\u0027d be looking at your wife and rolling her eyes.\u0022\u000A\u000AWe continued drinking the rosé with the lobster consommé, intensely silky and flecked with saffron. Within each bowl was a perfectly poached quail egg, which brought Boone near to tears of gratitude. \u0022The first quail egg of my pathetic dining life,\u0022 he announced. I could only agree with this sad assessment, for I seemed to recall him identifying Auguste Escoffier as a chippy left-winger for the Montreal Canadiens. The next course was a quenelle, a dumpling made of ground fish, a dish that few men make better than MacGuire, who is as much at home in the cool back rooms of the pastry world as he is at the open fires of the hearth. The delicate dumpling, prepared from a fish known as the pike perch here and the sander in France, came with Nantua sauce, made with the cooking liquid of crayfish enhanced with white wine and cream. On each plate was a puff pastry. Much as I have praised MacGuire for his precocity with the dumpling, I must unabashedly declare him the greatest puff-pastry man I have ever met. I stabbed at mine, fearing it would float up and away from the plate. Then I rose to my feet and applauded the course, joined by my friends.\u000A\u000AThe veal sweetbreads came next, just a few thick slices that reminded me of filet mignon, which sweetbreads never had before. My friend the lawyer said the meal was like many he had eaten with great pleasure at Lutèce in New York, back when André Soltner was the chef. Lavished on the sweetbreads were black truffles from China—oversize, thickly sliced and absolutely gorgeous, although I would argue they were not as richly perfumed as those from the better truffle-gathering regions of France. The lawyer asked if he could have seconds, and I adamantly informed him he could not. I have wasted too many hours at too many tables throughout the world watching him devour seconds and thirds of one lavish dish after another, oblivious to those of us of lesser capacity able to do nothing but sit resentfully and watch.\u000A\u000AThe loin of wild caribou arrived quickly enough to quiet his grumblings, and my friend the amateur cook was astonished to eat something from a wild beast that was this soft, this mellow, this rich; it tasted a little like venison, yet milder and more luxurious. \u0022I\u0027d eat this every week if I could,\u0022 he exclaimed in wonderment, and I assured him that he would be able to only if he had a close personal relationship with the native Indians of northern Quebec permitted by the government to cull overgrown caribou herds. With the dish, Léandri served my favorite wine of the meal, a 1997 Châteauneuf-du-Pape from Beaucastel. I expected it to be hard and tannic because it was youthful and came from a difficult year; instead it was soft, with a sweet gaminess, an unparalleled accompaniment to the caribou. MacGuire honored us by preparing his pommes soufflées, which are twice-fried potato slices that puff up until they have the texture of cotton candy. I suspect pommes soufflées were the world\u0027s first fun food.\u000A\u000AThere was cheese, of course, a local Rougette de Brigham, which tasted like a cross between Muenster and Epoisses, although not as pungent as either at its peak, and with that a grand cru Gewrztraminer from Steinert, a fine Alsace producer. Gewrztraminer, which smells a little like rose petals and a little like litchi nuts, is the best wine accompaniment in the world to strong, soft cheese. Dessert was MacGuire\u0027s sweet brioche, cooked like French toast and served with sautéed sliced apples and vanilla ice cream that he had made himself, using about four times the amount of vanilla found in ordinary ice creams. This was not too much, since the vanilla he had obtained from a local importer was about four times as delicious as that found in ordinary ice creams.\u000A\u000AAfter the meal was completed and we were sipping Darjeeling tea from the first spring picking, I asked my friends what they thought of the experience. I wondered about the emptiness—and silence—of the room, which I feared one or two of them would find off-putting, but it seemed I had invited friends secure enough in their own company not to need background noise. Boone, away from the newsroom, found it soothing. The cook, who lives in an apartment with his wife and two small boys, found it luxurious. The lawyer decided he would do it more often, and I am sure he will. I liked that I was allowed to use either the men\u0027s or the ladies\u0027 room, whichever I preferred, a bit of eccentric behavior on my part that caused our young scholar-waitress to blush.\u000A\u000AThe bill in U.S. dollars for a nearly perfect dinner—MacGuire remarked apologetically that the consommé could have been a little clearer—was approximately $1,050 for the food and wine, $175 for tas (extraordinarily high in Quebec) and $300 for service. Le Passe- Partout doesn\u0027t have accommodations, so I\u0027d arranged for three bed-and-breakfast rooms in Westmount, a tiny independent city of about 20,000 abutting Montreal. Only one of the rooms had a private bath, which I\u0027d assigned to the hotshot lawyer, who wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. The amateur chef and I had joint use of the other bathroom, which is the way it used to be on those Michelin excursions a half century ago. I have to say, it\u0027s not entirely idyllic, sharing a bathroom with a man who takes a shower, stands drying himself on the tub mat until it\u0027s soaked through and then leaves it sopping on the floor. (I don\u0027t know how his wife endures this, day after day.) The rooms came to $175 and included an \u0022egg nest\u0022 breakfast entrée—a savory meringue encircling a soft-boiled egg yolk. The breakfast experience was marred slightly when the amateur cook spilled his cup of boiling-hot tea on an antique black walnut table brought to Canada by Sir Hugh Allan, one of the bedrocks of nineteenth-century Montreal. I apologized, but I believe the proprietor understood the risks involved. American tourists seldom if ever enter a foreign country without despoiling it somewhat.\u000A\u000AAdding in lunch, gasoline and doughnuts, the total amount spent on the trip was $1,975. Unlike my young colleagues from this magazine (and certain charitable organizations rated undesirable by watchdog organizations), I severely contained administrative costs, allocating almost all my money to food and wine. My unseasoned colleagues, as I understand it, chose to pursue their stories by traveling overseas strapped into coach seats, which does not sound like the pursuit of perfection to me. Knowing the extent of their generosity, I presume their companions had to purchase their own tickets and were invited to sleep on benches in foreign airports. My friends spent not a loonie—that\u0027s a Canadian dollar, worth about 66 American cents—and were provided with the comforts of a historic home. I am certain my callow colleagues did a praiseworthy job. It\u0027s a shame they did not understand the difference between an eating story and a flying story, but I suppose that sort of astuteness will come with experience and a few worthwhile meals.\u000A\u000AAlan Richman\u0027s expenses:\u000A\u000A B&amp;B for three, $175.00\u000A\u000A Gasoline, $80.00\u000A\u000A Doughnuts, $10.00\u000A\u000A Lunch at Betty Beaver\u0027s Truckstop &amp; Diner (truffle included), $185.00\u000A\u000A Dinner at Le Passe-Partout, $1,525.00\u000A\u000A TOTAL: $1,975.00",

at</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.2"><em>GQ</em> is a tough job. Really. So much eating and drinking, all with your best interests&#x2014;never their own&#x2014;in mind. And yet what thanks do these poor, overfed men get? Well, for one, the satisfaction of knowing who is the best. After we read that dinner for two at Alain Ducasse costs almost $900, we gave Alan Richman, Adam Sachs and Adam Rapoport $2,000 each to create the meal of their dreams. The rules were simple: They could travel anywhere in the world, eat anything in the world and bring as many guests as they wanted&#x2014;so long as they did not spend more than their allotted $2,000.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.3">_</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.5">We departed New York early on the morning of the meal&#x2014;me, two friends and a sack of doughnuts. They insisted I buy both the Bavarian and vanilla kremes, which seemed excessive, but I&#x2019;d told them they could have anything they wanted until the money ran out. Ahead of us was a 400-mile drive to Montreal and my promise of the most exquisite dinner of our lives. At the very least, it would be the most expensive. I&#x2019;d planned everything with meticulous care, but I still wasn&#x2019;t certain of success. After all, I was in search of perfection, which is something not easily prearranged. I&#x2019;d always known that someday I&#x2019;d have a meal that I would forever call the best of my life, but I thought it would be an accident, the luck of the road. I imagined it taking place in Italy or France and going something like this:</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.6">An unpaved, twisting detour would bring me to an unmapped hilltop town near Orvieto, where I&#x2019;d find a tiny trattoria surrounded by trees heavy with olives, and I&#x2019;d sit on the terra-cotta patio sipping red wine made by the proprietor that he sold by the carafe for almost nothing even though it had the bouquet of a Bruno Giacosa Barbaresco, and the sun slanting through the low drifting clouds would turn the mist the color of a burnished Roman shield, and the proprietor&#x2019;s daughter would ask, in an Umbrian dialect unknown to me but somehow understandable, &#x201C;Would you honor us by trying the tortellini my great-grandmother made this morning?&#x201C; Or I&#x2019;d stop for a simple prix fi lunch at a French villa built by a count in the seventeenth century for his mistress, and the ch&#xE8;vre brought to my table by the Cordon Bleu-trained staff would have the flavor of wild thyme eaten by goats living in the mountains, and I&#x2019;d open the wine list and there it would be, the 1929 La T&#xE2;che I&#x2019;d dreamed of all my life, only 120 francs, and the aging sommelier would thank me profusely, explaining that clients of my discernment came all too rarely to this forgotten lake that rippled whenever the soft breezes from the Pyrenees stirred the water lilies.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.7">I didn&#x2019;t expect to be in a car with a couple of guys, eating doughnuts and headed for Canada.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.8">I had $2,000, and money can buy a lot when it comes to groceries, but I wanted the meal to be more than merely long and expensive. I wanted it to resonate with history. That&#x2019;s why I decided to duplicate a dining experience I&#x2019;d always regretted not having, a Michelin-style road trip. About a half century ago, which was slightly before my time, French epicures would visit the great restaurants of their country by automobile, staying in the most unostentatious accommodations imaginable, rooms without private baths on the floors above the restaurants where they ate. Their goal was to spend money on not much else besides dinner, because they had little wealth, and food and wine were all they cared about. They were the first foodies obsessed by the Michelin guide, with its famous (and now largely ignored) definitions of two- and three-star restaurants as being worth a detour or a special trip. These days, of course, three-star French restaurants are gilded Vegas palaces, where German industrialists arrive by helicopter and insist on marble-clad suites.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.9">I wanted to return to a time when dining was a purer and more focused experience. To that end, I chose as my destination the restaurant-bakery Le Passe-Partout in Montreal. Seating only about thirty, located a few miles from the center of the city and operated by an autocratic (but kindly) French-trained former New Yorker named James MacGuire, Le Passe-Partout reminds me of a perfectly correct neighborhood French restaurant. Although open for only twenty years and at its present location for less than ten, it seems precisely of the era I sought to re-create. MacGuire, who is 50, cooks French classics as well as any chef I know. He does not interpret them. He does not seek to improve upon them. He says of chefs who do, &#x201C;I think it is inadmissible to make customers pay for your experiments.&#x201C; Le Passe-Partout is open for lunch only two days a week and for dinner on just three, which meant I could select from among a bevy of off days to book the entire place for my friends and me. For my $2,000 meal, I did not particularly want strangers in the room.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.a">The driver of the car was a friend who has accompanied me on a number of dining trips, a big-shot New York lawyer who can eat as much as any man alive, providing his wife is not present to monitor him. Shortly after we set out, he made it clear to me that while the meal I had planned might be the most costly of my life, it was no record breaker for him. The second friend in the car was a kindhearted fellow who has no formal cooking training whatsoever yet attempts every to have a look but declined to taste it, explaining, &#x201C;The smell&#x2019;s got me whupped.&#x201C; Lunch, with a generous tip, added $35 more to the cost of the trip. Not only was the meal a success; we had divested ourselves of the truffle before reaching the Canadian border and having to explain the odor in our car to distrustful customs officials.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.b">Dinner was scheduled for 7:30 P.M., and we were on time, although it was unnecessary, since the entire restaurant was ours for the night. MacGuire had chosen a table in the center of the peach-pink room and obtained the services of a renowned sommelier, Don-Jean L&#xE9;andri, who had directed the wine service at the wedding of Celine Dion. Our waitress was a willowy, blond university student with the irresistible name of Sarah-Maya C&#xF4;t&#xE9;-Jirik, an Uma Thurman look-alike who works in restaurants part-time. She told us she was studying sociology at the University of Montreal, which I found admirable, because any woman living in the United States who looks like her would choose modeling, not higher education, as a pursuit. Boone, ever the correct Canadian, arrived in a tie, but the rest of us dressed less formally, yet another advantage of booking the whole place. We took our damask-covered chairs, and Boone set the conversational tone for the evening while we sipped 1989 Veuve Clicquot Le Grand Dame Ros&#xE9; Champagne, which was magnificent, and nibbled canap&#xE9;s of foie gras, salmon smoked over alder chips, and caviar from sturgeon caught in the St. Lawrence River. He regaled us with stories of the late Little Beaver, the greatest midget wrestler in the history of Montreal, whose battles with arch foe Fuzzy Cupid are epic. &#x201C;Little Beaver was a four-foot-four French Canadian from Montreal who had a Mohawk haircut before it became fashionable, which was after James Fenimore Cooper and before Johnny Rotten,&#x201C; Boone said. &#x201C;When things weren&#x2019;t going well, when Fuzzy Cupid was having his way with him, Little Beaver would throw his moccasins at the referee, which I believe was an early sign of defiance against authority figures who had oppressed the Indians, even if he wasn&#x2019;t really an Indian.&#x201C; I could have listened all night, for Boone&#x2019;s storytelling was in the classic narrative style practiced by Montrealers snowed in for the winter in the days before global warming ruined the essential nature of Canadian life. My friend the amateur chef mentioned that such a convivial moment was possible only because of the absence of our wives, who would not have tolerated such a rousing, red-blooded tale. He said, &#x201C;My wife would be pretending she was interested in the story, but then when she thought we weren&#x2019;t looking, she&#x2019;d be looking at your wife and rolling her eyes.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.c">We continued drinking the ros&#xE9; with the lobster consomm&#xE9;, intensely silky and flecked with saffron. Within each bowl was a perfectly poached quail egg, which brought Boone near to tears of gratitude. &#x201C;The first quail egg of my pathetic dining life,&#x201C; he announced. I could only agree with this sad assessment, for I seemed to recall him identifying Auguste Escoffier as a chippy left-winger for the Montreal Canadiens. The next course was a quenelle, a dumpling made of ground fish, a dish that few men make better than MacGuire, who is as much at home in the cool back rooms of the pastry world as he is at the open fires of the hearth. The delicate dumpling, prepared from a fish known as the pike perch here and the <em>sander</em> in France, came with Nantua sauce, made with the cooking liquid of crayfish enhanced with white wine and cream. On each plate was a puff pastry. Much as I have praised MacGuire for his precocity with the dumpling, I must unabashedly declare him the greatest puff-pastry man I have ever met. I stabbed at mine, fearing it would float up and away from the plate. Then I rose to my feet and applauded the course, joined by my friends.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.d">The veal sweetbreads came next, just a few thick slices that reminded me of filet mignon, which sweetbreads never had before. My friend the lawyer said the meal was like many he had eaten with great pleasure at Lut&#xE8;ce in New York, back when Andr&#xE9; Soltner was the chef. Lavished on the sweetbreads were black truffles from China&#x2014;oversize, thickly sliced and absolutely gorgeous, although I would argue they were not as richly perfumed as those from the better truffle-gathering regions of France. The lawyer asked if he could have seconds, and I adamantly informed him he could not. I have wasted too many hours at too many tables throughout the world watching him devour seconds and thirds of one lavish dish after another, oblivious to those of us of lesser capacity able to do nothing but sit resentfully and watch.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.e">The loin of wild caribou arrived quickly enough to quiet his grumblings, and my friend the amateur cook was astonished to eat something from a wild beast that was this soft, this mellow, this rich; it tasted a little like venison, yet milder and more luxurious. &#x201C;I&#x2019;d eat this every week if I could,&#x201C; he exclaimed in wonderment, and I assured him that he would be able to only if he had a close personal relationship with the native Indians of northern Quebec permitted by the government to cull overgrown caribou herds. With the dish, L&#xE9;andri served my favorite wine of the meal, a 1997 Ch&#xE2;teauneuf-du-Pape from Beaucastel. I expected it to be hard and tannic because it was youthful and came from a difficult year; instead it was soft, with a sweet gaminess, an unparalleled accompaniment to the caribou. MacGuire honored us by preparing his <em>pommes souffl&#xE9;es</em>, which are twice-fried potato slices that puff up until they have the texture of cotton candy. I suspect <em>pommes souffl&#xE9;es</em> were the world&#x2019;s first fun food.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.f">There was cheese, of course, a local Rougette de Brigham, which tasted like a cross between Muenster and Epoisses, although not as pungent as either at its peak, and with that a <em>grand cru</em> Gewrztraminer from Steinert, a fine Alsace producer. Gewrztraminer, which smells a little like rose petals and a little like litchi nuts, is the best wine accompaniment in the world to strong, soft cheese. Dessert was MacGuire&#x2019;s sweet brioche, cooked like French toast and served with saut&#xE9;ed sliced apples and vanilla ice cream that he had made himself, using about four times the amount of vanilla found in ordinary ice creams. This was not too much, since the vanilla he had obtained from a local importer was about four times as delicious as that found in ordinary ice creams.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.g">After the meal was completed and we were sipping Darjeeling tea from the first spring picking, I asked my friends what they thought of the experience. I wondered about the emptiness&#x2014;and silence&#x2014;of the room, which I feared one or two of them would find off-putting, but it seemed I had invited friends secure enough in their own company not to need background noise. Boone, away from the newsroom, found it soothing. The cook, who lives in an apartment with his wife and two small boys, found it luxurious. The lawyer decided he would do it more often, and I am sure he will. I liked that I was allowed to use either the men&#x2019;s or the ladies&#x2019; room, whichever I preferred, a bit of eccentric behavior on my part that caused our young scholar-waitress to blush.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.h">The bill in U.S. dollars for a nearly perfect dinner&#x2014;MacGuire remarked apologetically that the consomm&#xE9; could have been a little clearer&#x2014;was approximately $1,050 for the food and wine, $175 for tas (extraordinarily high in Quebec) and $300 for service. Le Passe- Partout doesn&#x2019;t have accommodations, so I&#x2019;d arranged for three bed-and-breakfast rooms in Westmount, a tiny independent city of about 20,000 abutting Montreal. Only one of the rooms had a private bath, which I&#x2019;d assigned to the hotshot lawyer, who wouldn&#x2019;t have it any other way. The amateur chef and I had joint use of the other bathroom, which is the way it used to be on those Michelin excursions a half century ago. I have to say, it&#x2019;s not entirely idyllic, sharing a bathroom with a man who takes a shower, stands drying himself on the tub mat until it&#x2019;s soaked through and then leaves it sopping on the floor. (I don&#x2019;t know how his wife endures this, day after day.) The rooms came to $175 and included an &#x201C;egg nest&#x201C; breakfast entr&#xE9;e&#x2014;a savory meringue encircling a soft-boiled egg yolk. The breakfast experience was marred slightly when the amateur cook spilled his cup of boiling-hot tea on an antique black walnut table brought to Canada by Sir Hugh Allan, one of the bedrocks of nineteenth-century Montreal. I apologized, but I believe the proprietor understood the risks involved. American tourists seldom if ever enter a foreign country without despoiling it somewhat.</p><p data-reactid=".13pwxx6z5ds.1.1.0.0.4.i">Adding in lunch, gasoline and doughnuts, the total amount spent on the trip was $1,975. Unlike my young colleagues from this magazine (and certain charitable organizations rated undesirable by watchdog organizations), I severely contained administrative costs, allocating almost all my money to food and wine. My unseasoned colleagues, as I understand it, chose to pursue their stories by traveling overseas strapped into coach seats, which does not sound like the pursuit of perfection to me. Knowing the extent of their generosity, I presume their companions had to purchase their own tickets and were invited to sleep on benches in foreign airports. My friends spent not a loonie&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a Canadian dollar, worth about 66 American cents&#x2014;and were provided with the comforts of a historic home. I am certain my callow colleagues did a praiseworthy job. It&#x2019;s a shame they did not understand the difference between an eating story and a flying story, but I suppose that sort of astuteness will come with experience and a few worthwhile meals.</p><p
