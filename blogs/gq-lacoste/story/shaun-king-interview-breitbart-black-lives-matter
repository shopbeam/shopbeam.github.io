  	    "description": "The Black Lives Matter activist talks to GQ in his first in-depth interview since the Daily Kos story",
  	    "articleBody": "I heard the news about Shaun King on \u0022The Rush Limbaugh Show.\u0022 Driving down I-95 toward Boston, scanning the dial, pausing for a moment on Rush\u0027s monologue: \u0022…the Black Lives Matter organizer,\u0022 says Rush, \u0022is white.\u0022 The Black Lives Matter organizer? \u0022The guy who put it together,\u0022 says Limbaugh, \u0022is white,\u0022 and his name is Shaun King.\u000A\u000AThis much, at least, we can dismiss as false: Shaun King is not the organizer of Black Lives Matter, because Black Lives Matter has no single organizer. King\u0027s employed by the liberal blog Daily Kos, for whom he writes about police brutality. He\u0027s good at it—178,000 Twitter followers; a loyal readership on Daily Kos, including journalists like me who look to King to keep us up to date on the details behind what the British paper The Guardian has come to call \u0022The Counted\u0022: 759 Americans killed by police so far this year.\u000A\u000ASo it\u0027s fair to call him a leader in the Black Lives Matter movement. Is it fair to call him white? Why does Rush care? It\u0027s not likely he would have, had the conservative site Breitbart not amplified the work of a little-known conservative blogger called Vicki Pate, who says she recently began to \u0022stalk Shaun King\u0027s social media.\u0022 It was Pate, according to Breitbart, who obtained a birth record on which a man identified in unrelated documents as white is listed as his father.\u000A\u000ASince then, mainstream media has taken up the story; King has had to answer not just to right-wingers openly antagonistic to Black Lives Matter but also to a less-partisan press that nonetheless seems intrigued by the possibility of racial scandal. King has responded with a post on Daily Kos, in which he writes:\u000A\u000A\u0022I refuse to speak in detail about the nature of my mother\u0027s past, or her sexual partners, and I am gravely embarrassed to even be saying this now, but I have been told for most of my life that the white man on my birth certificate is not my biological father and that my actual biological father is a light-skinned black man. My mother and I have discussed her affair. She was a young woman in a bad relationship and I have no judgment. This has been my lived reality for nearly 30 of my 35 years on earth.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhoever his father is, King isn\u0027t a male version of Rachel Dolezal, the white NAACP organizer who began passing as black after a lifetime as a white woman. King was told by his mother he was black and has lived most of his life as black. He writes, \u0022Adults who loved and knew me, on many occasions sat me down and told me that I was black. As you could imagine, this had a profound impact on me and soon became my truth. Every friend I had was black, my girlfriends were black, I was seen as black, treated as black, and endured constant overt racism as a young black teenager.\u0022 It was only later that he came to understand himself as biracial. \u0022Never have I once identified myself as white,\u0022 he writes.\u000A\u000AI know King as an online persona—we\u0027ve corresponded about police brutality—so I asked him if we could talk about the new color line being drawn by his critics. I told him there was one question I wasn\u0027t going to ask: Are you white? He\u0027s already given his answer. Instead I asked:\u000A\u000AGQ: What does it mean when some of the biggest media machines in America insist you\u0027re not who you think you are?\u000A\u000AShaun King: I\u0027ll be honest with you, for the past year it\u0027s been a constant stream of harassment and ugliness. And not just with me, but with dozens of us who are doing this type of work. Racial slurs, epithets, just outright lies, personal info being put out there. You never quite grow used to it, and it\u0027s hard to avoid. I can\u0027t go online and not see it. It\u0027s on all of my social networks and it\u0027s in my inbox. And in spite of all that, this past week still really took me by surprise. I\u0027d never thought that the ugly stuff people say would pick up momentum. I never thought it would hop the fence and be carried by mainstream media.\u000A\u000AThe mainstream media picked up the limited reporting done by the right-wing press, and instead of vetting it mostly just threw it back at you. The New York Times\u0027s headline says, \u0022Shaun King Denies Claims He Lied.\u0022 It went international, too—The Australian, a major paper, headlined its story, \u0022Civil Rights activist Shaun King embroiled in race lies controversy.\u0022\u000A\u000AI saw the Australian piece. I can\u0027t believe this is an international story. I, like, bared my soul [in the Daily Kos response], and it\u0027s still he-said/she-said with these terrible headlines.\u000A\u000AWhen did this begin? I remember back in July seeing people respond to news stories you were tweeting with this strange racial non sequitur. You\u0027d say something about how many people police have killed, and critics would respond, \u0022Yeah, but you\u0027re white.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s been my world. I remember the day Mike Brown was killed. I was retweeting people who were literally looking at his body in the street. I remember sharing it and seeing these weird messages from nameless, faceless accounts, people saying he deserved it, or people posting comical memes of his body in the street. This was the day he was shot. From that point forward, it\u0027s been nonstop. After Mike Brown was killed, the nature of it really changed. It\u0027s been ugly ever since.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s like a reversal of the old racist idea of \u0022one drop of blood\u0022—one drop of non-white blood in your veins means you\u0027re not white, and you don\u0027t count. Your critics flip that: Unless you can prove that drop of blood, you\u0027re not black and thus lack the credibility to speak about racism. It\u0027s the same sentiment, repackaged—the desire for sharp, clear racial categories.\u000A\u000AAs soon as I saw it, I knew that they didn\u0027t know that this was actually a long, complicated journey for me. People would say, \u0022Shaun King is white.\u0022 I\u0027m thinking: These folks have no idea how complicated and personal my story has been. I made up in my mind, months before I ever saw that, that if anybody ever said anything about me that was just ridiculous or salacious, I wasn\u0027t gonna come out and publicly defend it. I think their intention has been, \u0022Let\u0027s tell as many lies that we think may easily pass as true and see what sticks.\u0022 In the Breitbart article, it said I lied about how many kids I had. Which is ridiculous. We have five kids, but we have three birth children. We adopted our oldest daughter when she was five, and now she\u0027s fifteen. Our youngest daughter has been with us since she was born, but she\u0027s not our biological daughter. We\u0027ve had other foster children, nieces and nephews, that have stayed with us. People scoured every tweet I have ever written. There were some days I said we have four kids. Well, at that time we had four, and there were other times I said we had six, and at that time we had six.\u000A\u000AMost of your critics have backed off the topic of your kids, but they\u0027re not letting go of your assertion that your teenage years were defined by racial violence.\u000A\u000AI was never targeted because I was white. People weren\u0027t calling me \u0022white\u0022; people were calling me \u0022nigger.\u0022 In 1993, I got into a fight at a high school football game, between me and a white student. That fight ended up setting off a racial powder keg. There was a walkout because the school decided that they were going to ban Confederate-flag T-shirts, stemming from the fight I had gotten into. It wasn\u0027t black students; it was white students. When I got to school after my three-day suspension, my whole life was different. Hundreds of white students, particularly those who felt like I was the reason that the Confederate flag had been banned, just hated my guts. From that day forward, every day was tough. Little stuff. From going to my locker and all my books would be gone to having to defend myself several times to being spit on.\u000A\u000AIn 1995, you were beaten in a racial incident. You and another witness say it was a group of around a dozen students. Your critics cite witnesses who say you were beaten by just one boy, but they say what really matters is the police report—the responding officer marked you as white. (He\u0027s since publicly stated he thought you were biracial.)\u000A\u000AHe said he knew that I was mixed and everybody in town knew I was mixed, but that there were only two boxes and he chose one. I actually just spoke to him two days ago. He was like, \u0022Listen, Shaun, I was in a hurry to get the report complete. I wasn\u0027t thinking about the philosophy of race. I just checked it.\u0022 Nothing illustrates better the complexity not just of my story but the weirdness, the ridiculousness, of race in general.\u000A\u000AThe effect of the accusations has been to make you subject to constant racial scrutiny.\u000A\u000AI think that\u0027s exactly it. People are angry because I posted this quote from Assata Shakur. I have it right in front of me. She said, \u0022The first thing the enemy tries to do is isolate revolutionaries from the masses of people, making us horrible and hideous monsters so our people will hate us.\u0022 I feel like that\u0027s what\u0027s happened to me. They\u0027ve positioned me as something other.\u000A\u000AAnd by then describing you as the leader of Black Lives Matter, they\u0027re positioning the whole movement as racially suspect, as \u0022something other.\u0022\u000A\u000AFirst of all, I definitely don\u0027t see myself as the leader of this movement. Part of what has made it so powerful and effective is that it doesn\u0027t have one central leader. I\u0027m just one voice among many. I think, though, they were well aware that if they could convince people I was the leader and then take me out, it would somehow delegitimize the movement altogether. In that sense, the attack was effective. It was a huge distraction from really important stories that needed to be told. I don\u0027t think it had the end effect that they hoped it would, but media lives forever, and all of these outlets have published these articles saying I\u0027m basically a crazy man. And if I get online and say, \u0022This isn\u0027t true,\u0022 people are like, \u0022It\u0027s strange that he feels the need to defend himself.\u0022 It puts me in a very bad spot. If they\u0027ve put doubts in people\u0027s minds that I am who I say I am, it makes my job that much harder.\u000A\u000AWhile we\u0027ve been talking, as a test, I tweeted, \u0022I\u0027m talking to @ShaunKing right now.\u0022 And very quickly I got this reply: \u0022Ask him if he\u0027s still a black man.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis is the new normal. People I love and trust advise me to just drop off the face of the Earth for an extended period of time and maybe that will calm or cool things down. But my work is very public work. Somebody in my family yesterday asked me, \u0022Shaun, couldn\u0027t you teach middle school history\u0022—that was my first job out of Morehouse. I would never crawl into a secret space to avoid the frustrating things. I think this is the new normal. I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll stop at all. I don\u0027t think it matters if I\u0027m on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram. None of that matters. I think this is a sign of the new America. I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll ever stop.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s been the effect on your family?\u000A\u000AWe\u0027ve had situations. I purchased an extra gun for the house. I bought a new gun safe, and we put cameras around our house. I guess I don\u0027t feel safe at all. My mother is 64 years old. She gets phone calls and e-mails every day, all day, from people wanting to talk with her. She\u0027s had local media literally show up on her front doorstep, so she\u0027s gone to stay with other family members. It\u0027s also taken a huge toll on my wife. She\u0027s a schoolteacher. The school decided to take extra security measures. The principal wanted to speak to her about it. Parents know. I have 13- and 15-year-old daughters. My daughters\u0027 friends, they were hanging out with their friends, and their friends were like, \u0022Have you heard about [Shaun King]?\u0022 And my daughters\u0027 friends were in the position of saying, \u0022Actually, we know him and love him.\u0022 Already it\u0027s taken on that life of its own. Everywhere I go, people stop and say something to me. I was dropping our 2-year-old off at daycare, and a lady in the parking lot looked at me and said, \u0022I saw you in the news.\u0022 Yesterday I\u0027m pumping gas, the woman on the other side of the pump is staring at me, and then she asks, \u0022Are you @ShaunKing?\u0022 She literally says \u0022At-Shaun-King.\u0022 And I say \u0022yes\u0022 and she says, \u0022Oh, you are so black!\u0022\u000A\u000A",

data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.0">I heard the news about Shaun King on &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show.&quot; Driving down I-95 toward Boston, scanning the dial, pausing for a moment on Rush&apos;s monologue: &quot;&#x2026;the Black Lives Matter organizer,&quot; says Rush, &quot;is white.&quot; <em>The</em> Black Lives Matter organizer? &quot;The guy who put it together,&quot; says Limbaugh, &quot;is white,&quot; and his name is Shaun King.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.1">This much, at least, we can dismiss as false: Shaun King is not <em>the</em> organizer of Black Lives Matter, because Black Lives Matter has no single organizer. King&apos;s employed by the liberal blog Daily Kos, for whom he writes about police brutality. He&apos;s good at it&#x2014;178,000 <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaunKing?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter</a> followers; a loyal readership on Daily Kos, including journalists like me who look to King to keep us up to date on the details behind what the British paper <em>The Guardian</em> has come to call &quot;The Counted&quot;: 759 Americans killed by police so far this year.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.2">So it&apos;s fair to call him <em>a</em> leader in the Black Lives Matter movement. Is it fair to call him white? Why does Rush care? It&apos;s not likely he would have, had the conservative site Breitbart not <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/19/did-black-lives-matter-organiser-shaun-king-mislead-oprah-winfrey-by-pretending-to-be-biracial/">amplified the work</a> of a little-known conservative blogger called Vicki Pate, who says she recently began to &quot;stalk Shaun King&apos;s social media.&quot; It was Pate, according to Breitbart, who obtained a birth record on which a man identified in unrelated documents as white is listed as his father.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.3">Since then, mainstream media has taken up the story; King has had to answer not just to right-wingers openly antagonistic to Black Lives Matter but also to a less-partisan press that nonetheless seems intrigued by the possibility of racial scandal. King has responded with a <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/08/20/1413881/-Race-love-hate-and-me-A-distinctly-American-story">post on Daily Kos</a>, in which he writes:</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.5">&quot;I refuse to speak in detail about the nature of my mother&apos;s past, or her sexual partners, and I am gravely embarrassed to even be saying this now, but I have been told for most of my life that the white man on my birth certificate is not my biological father and that my actual biological father is a light-skinned black man. My mother and I have discussed her affair. She was a young woman in a bad relationship and I have no judgment. This has been my lived reality for nearly 30 of my 35 years on earth.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.6">Whoever his father is, King isn&apos;t a male version of Rachel Dolezal, the white NAACP organizer who began passing as black after a lifetime as a white woman. King was told by his mother he was black and has lived most of his life as black. He writes, &quot;Adults who loved and knew me, on many occasions sat me down and told me that I was black. As you could imagine, this had a profound impact on me and soon became my truth. Every friend I had was black, my girlfriends were black, I was seen as black, treated as black, and endured constant overt racism as a young black teenager.&quot; It was only later that he came to understand himself as biracial. &quot;Never have I once identified myself as white,&quot; he writes.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.7">I know King as an online persona&#x2014;we&apos;ve corresponded about police brutality&#x2014;so I asked him if we could talk about the new color line being drawn by his critics. I told him there was one question I wasn&apos;t going to ask: Are you white? He&apos;s already given his answer. Instead I asked:</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>GQ: What does it mean when some of the biggest media machines in America insist you&apos;re not who you think you are?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>Shaun King:</strong> I&apos;ll be honest with you, for the past year it&apos;s been a constant stream of harassment and ugliness. And not just with me, but with dozens of us who are doing this type of work. Racial slurs, epithets, just outright lies, personal info being put out there. You never quite grow used to it, and it&apos;s hard to avoid. I can&apos;t go online and not see it. It&apos;s on all of my social networks and it&apos;s in my inbox. And in spite of all that, this past week still really took me by surprise. I&apos;d never thought that the ugly stuff people say would pick up momentum. I never thought it would hop the fence and be carried by mainstream media.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>The mainstream media picked up the limited reporting done by the right-wing press, and instead of vetting it mostly just threw it back at you. <em>The New York Times</em>&apos;s headline says, &quot;Shaun King Denies Claims He Lied.&quot; It went international, too&#x2014;<em>The Australian,</em> a major paper, headlined its story, &quot;Civil Rights activist Shaun King embroiled in race lies controversy.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.b">I saw the <em>Australian</em> piece. I can&apos;t believe this is an international story. I, like, bared my soul [in the Daily Kos response], and it&apos;s still he-said/she-said with these terrible headlines.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>When did this begin? I remember back in July seeing people respond to news stories you were tweeting with this strange racial non sequitur. You&apos;d say something about how many people police have killed, and critics would respond, &quot;Yeah, but you&apos;re white.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.d">That&apos;s been my world. I remember the day Mike Brown was killed. I was retweeting people who were literally looking at his body in the street. I remember sharing it and seeing these weird messages from nameless, faceless accounts, people saying he deserved it, or people posting comical memes of his body in the street. This was the day he was shot. From that point forward, it&apos;s been nonstop. After Mike Brown was killed, the nature of it really changed. It&apos;s been ugly ever since.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>It&apos;s like a reversal of the old racist idea of &quot;one drop of blood&quot;&#x2014;one drop of non-white blood in your veins means you&apos;re not white, and you don&apos;t count. Your critics flip that: Unless you can prove that drop of blood, you&apos;re not black and thus lack the credibility to speak about racism. It&apos;s the same sentiment, repackaged&#x2014;the desire for sharp, clear racial categories.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.f">As soon as I saw it, I knew that they didn&apos;t know that this was actually a long, complicated journey for me. People would say, &quot;Shaun King is white.&quot; I&apos;m thinking: <em>These folks have no idea how complicated and personal my story has been.</em> I made up in my mind, months before I ever saw that, that if anybody ever said anything about me that was just ridiculous or salacious, I wasn&apos;t gonna come out and publicly defend it. I think their intention has been, &quot;Let&apos;s tell as many lies that we think may easily pass as true and see what sticks.&quot; In the Breitbart article, it said I lied about how many kids I had. Which is ridiculous. We have five kids, but we have three birth children. We adopted our oldest daughter when she was five, and now she&apos;s fifteen. Our youngest daughter has been with us since she was born, but she&apos;s not our biological daughter. We&apos;ve had other foster children, nieces and nephews, that have stayed with us. People scoured every tweet I have ever written. There were some days I said we have four kids. Well, at that time we had four, and there were other times I said we had six, and at that time we had six.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Most of your critics have backed off the topic of your kids, but they&apos;re not letting go of your assertion that your teenage years were defined by racial violence.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.h">I was never targeted because I was white. People weren&apos;t calling me &quot;white&quot;; people were calling me &quot;nigger.&quot; In 1993, I got into a fight at a high school football game, between me and a white student. That fight ended up setting off a racial powder keg. There was a walkout because the school decided that they were going to ban Confederate-flag T-shirts, stemming from the fight I had gotten into. It wasn&apos;t black students; it was white students. When I got to school after my three-day suspension, my whole life was different. Hundreds of white students, particularly those who felt like I was the reason that the Confederate flag had been banned, just hated my guts. From that day forward, every day was tough. Little stuff. From going to my locker and all my books would be gone to having to defend myself several times to being spit on.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>In 1995, you were beaten in a racial incident. You and another witness say it was a group of around a dozen students. Your critics cite witnesses who say you were beaten by just one boy, but they say what really matters is the police report&#x2014;the responding officer marked you as white. (He&apos;s since publicly stated he thought you were biracial.)</strong></p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.j">He said he knew that I was mixed and everybody in town knew I was mixed, but that there were only two boxes and he chose one. I actually just spoke to him two days ago. He was like, &quot;Listen, Shaun, I was in a hurry to get the report complete. I wasn&apos;t thinking about the philosophy of race. I just checked it.&quot; Nothing illustrates better the complexity not just of my story but the weirdness, the ridiculousness, of race in general.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>The effect of the accusations has been to make you subject to constant racial scrutiny.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.l">I think that&#x2019;s exactly it. People are angry because I posted this quote from Assata Shakur. I have it right in front of me. She said, &#x201C;The first thing the enemy tries to do is isolate revolutionaries from the masses of people, making us horrible and hideous monsters so our people will hate us.&#x201D; I feel like that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s happened to me. They&#x2019;ve positioned me as something other.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>And by then describing you as the leader of Black Lives Matter, they&#x2019;re positioning the whole movement as racially suspect, as &#x201C;something other.&#x201D;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.n">First of all, I definitely don&apos;t see myself as <em>the</em> leader of this movement. Part of what has made it so powerful and effective is that it doesn&apos;t have one central leader. I&apos;m just one voice among many. I think, though, they were well aware that if they could convince people I was the leader and then take me out, it would somehow delegitimize the movement altogether. In that sense, the attack was effective. It was a huge distraction from really important stories that needed to be told. I don&apos;t think it had the end effect that they hoped it would, but media lives forever, and all of these outlets have published these articles saying I&apos;m basically a crazy man. And if I get online and say, &quot;This isn&apos;t true,&quot; people are like, &quot;It&apos;s strange that he feels the need to defend himself.&quot; It puts me in a very bad spot. If they&apos;ve put doubts in people&apos;s minds that I am who I say I am, it makes my job that much harder.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>While we&#x2019;ve been talking, as a test, I tweeted, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m talking to @ShaunKing right now.&#x201D; And very quickly I got this reply: &#x201C;Ask him if he&#x2019;s still a black man.&#x201D;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.p">This is the new normal. People I love and trust advise me to just drop off the face of the Earth for an extended period of time and maybe that will calm or cool things down. But my work is very public work. Somebody in my family yesterday asked me, &#x201C;Shaun, couldn&#x2019;t you teach middle school history&#x201D;&#x2014;that was my first job out of Morehouse. I would never crawl into a secret space to avoid the frustrating things. I think this is the new normal. I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;ll stop at all. I don&#x2019;t think it matters if I&#x2019;m on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram. None of that matters. I think this is a sign of the new America. I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;ll ever stop.</p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>What&apos;s been the effect on your family?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.r">We&apos;ve had situations. I purchased an extra gun for the house. I bought a new gun safe, and we put cameras around our house. I guess I don&apos;t feel safe at all. My mother is 64 years old. She gets phone calls and e-mails every day, all day, from people wanting to talk with her. She&apos;s had local media literally show up on her front doorstep, so she&apos;s gone to stay with other family members. It&apos;s also taken a huge toll on my wife. She&apos;s a schoolteacher. The school decided to take extra security measures. The principal wanted to speak to her about it. Parents know. I have 13- and 15-year-old daughters. My daughters&apos; friends, they were hanging out with their friends, and <em>their</em> friends were like, &quot;Have you heard about [Shaun King]?&quot; And my daughters&apos; friends were in the position of saying, &quot;Actually, we know him and love him.&quot; Already it&apos;s taken on that life of its own. Everywhere I go, people stop and say something to me. I was dropping our 2-year-old off at daycare, and a lady in the parking lot looked at me and said, &quot;I saw you in the news.&quot; Yesterday I&apos;m pumping gas, the woman on the other side of the pump is staring at me, and then she asks, &quot;Are you @ShaunKing?&quot; She literally says &quot;At-Shaun-King.&quot; And I say &quot;yes&quot; and she says, &quot;Oh, you are <em>so</em> black!&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.4.s"><hr></div></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".zs25l8579c.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
