  	    "description": "In praise of Lowe\u0027s new brand of pathological enthusiasm. ",
  	    "articleBody": "In the spring of 2011, Rob Lowe pulled off an outstanding acting feat. His Parks and Recreation character, Chris Traeger, was a health-nut-nutcase obsessed with positivity, his bod, and abusing the word \u0022literally.\u0022 Traeger memorably tries to inspire a useless employee: \u0022I believe you are capable of much more,\u0022 he says. Lumpish Larry disagrees. \u0022Look in the mirror,\u0022 Traeger says to the portly dullard, and raises his palm flat in front of Larry\u0027s face as the mirror. \u0022You are an intelligent, charismatic, beautiful superhero.\u0022 Larry smiles, comforted. \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWho could get away with this bald-faced lie? Who could bewilder someone into believing it? Literally, only Rob Lowe.\u000A\u000ARob Lowe has been through a lot, character-wise. He\u0027s made government White House and played a sweet saxophone down the street in Georgetown in St. Elmo\u0027s Fire. He\u0027s been bested by Garth and Wayne.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ABut this is Rob Lowe\u0027s latest iteration: unendingly cheerful, vigorous resilience. He is Pollyanna in a perfectly fitted button-up, with a smoldering tan. His magnetic, pathological enthusiasm could literally not be more fun to watch, and his new role on Fox\u0027s new sitcom The Grinder highlights this magic better than ever.\u000A\u000AIn The Grinder, Lowe\u0027s character is a television star from a law procedural also called The Grinder, who has returned to join his brother\u0027s law practice. He thinks because he played a lawyer on TV, he is one. And though he is literally corrected constantly, he stomps around the office, throwing cartons of Chinese food at the wall during a frustrating all-nighter, and keeps up the farce, to himself at least.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAs in Parks and Rec, Lowe\u0027s character is only fooling himself. No matter how often the people around him try to correct his delusion, he doesn\u0027t care. His resistance to truth is outstanding. On Parks and Rec, characters would stare blankly at the camera while he rapid-fired his bullets of enthusiasm at them. On The Grinder, his brother tries to bring him back to earth constantly, but Lowe is a determined helium balloon, floating up into the ether with chirpy gusto. Here\u0027s something Lowe says in Parks and Rec: \u0022I take care of my body above all else—diet, exercise, supplements, positive thinking. Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born. I believe I am that human being.\u0022 Crucially, in sitcom format, there is no growth in his characters. For Lowe, this is great. He is the personification of confidence—or rather, a handsome sheen of confidence.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s his surface stuff—looks, stature, rapid speech patterns, gusto—that carries his sitcom characters. You sense there\u0027s a nothing-burger in there at best or, at worst, a tense ball of anxiety that\u0027s covered itself with layers of confidence, of tissue that might disintegrate if you poured water on them. This role could only be played, satisfyingly, by someone who distinctly isn\u0027t that, who has fought to avoid that. In his memoir Stories I Only Tell My Friends, Lowe writes about the shame he felt during a financially rough time for his family, when he had to use a camera strap as a belt. \u0022This is where my ability to ignore reality is a gift. I walk in like I\u0027m dressed like James Bond. No one says a word, and in fact, one girl asks where I got the cool belt. Fake confidence on the outside, as I will later learn, often trumps truthful turmoil on the inside.\u0022 Rob Lowe can play a parody of this because, we know, Rob Lowe is a pretty water that runs deep. \u000A\u000AAs Amy Wallace argued in her GQ profile of Lowe in September, self-mocking was part of Lowe\u0027s transformation. His recovery from addiction had comedy baked into it. He appeared on SNL on March 17, 1990, the day he turned 26, and Dana Carvey\u0027s \u0022Church Lady\u0022 scolded him for being promiscuous. A few weeks after that, he went to rehab. A certain level of caricature suits him; he makes his handsomeness palatable by throwing it into sharp relief. One of his best runs was actually in the DirectTV commercial series where he played a parade of characters called things like Far Less Attractive Rob Lowe and Painfully Awkward Rob Lowe and Super Creepy Rob Lowe. After witnessing their awful plights, Regular Rob Lowe would come on and encourage people to upgrade from cable. (Lowe also foregrounds this power to manipulate, sinisterly as his terrifying plastic-surgeon character in the Liberace biopic Behind the Candelabra and sleazily as a consultant mastermind in Thank You for Smoking.)\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIn The Grinder\u0027s show-within-the-show, someone tells Rob Lowe\u0027s character\u0027s character, \u0022I want the real you, not the grinder, not this impenetrable god you need to be for everyone else!\u0022 We don\u0027t want that from Lowe, though. The performance of maniacal pretty narcissism is precisely what we want—just because we know he\u0027s more.",

Lowe&#39;s new brand of pathological enthusiasm. </h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.0">In the spring of 2011, Rob Lowe pulled off an outstanding acting feat. His <em>Parks and Recreation</em> character, Chris Traeger, was a health-nut-nutcase obsessed with positivity, his bod, and abusing the word &quot;literally.&quot; Traeger memorably tries to inspire a useless employee: &quot;I believe you are capable of much more,&#x201D; he says. Lumpish Larry disagrees. &quot;Look in the mirror,&quot; Traeger says to the portly dullard, and raises his palm flat in front of Larry&#x2019;s face as the mirror. &quot;You are an intelligent, charismatic, beautiful superhero.&quot; Larry smiles, comforted. </p><div class="embed figure" data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.1"><figure class="embedded-video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D9iDstmBxYQ" height="" width=""></iframe></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.2">Who could get away with this bald-faced lie? Who could bewilder someone into believing it? Literally, only Rob Lowe.</p><p data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.3">Rob Lowe has been through a lot, character-wise. He&#x2019;s made government White House and played a sweet saxophone down the street in Georgetown in <em>St. Elmo&#x2019;s Fire</em>. He&#x2019;s been bested by Garth and Wayne.</p><div class="embed figure" data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.5"><figure class="embedded-video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54K2F3zAZ0o" height="" width=""></iframe></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.6">But this is Rob Lowe&#x2019;s latest iteration: unendingly cheerful, vigorous resilience. He is Pollyanna in a perfectly fitted button-up, with a smoldering tan. His magnetic, pathological enthusiasm could literally not be more fun to watch, and his new role on Fox&#x2019;s new sitcom <em>The Grinder</em> highlights this magic better than ever.</p><p data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.7">In <em>The Grinder</em>, Lowe&apos;s character is a television star from a law procedural also called <em>The Grinder</em>, who has returned to join his brother&#x2019;s law practice. He thinks because he played a lawyer on TV, he is one. And though he is literally corrected constantly, he stomps around the office, throwing cartons of Chinese food at the wall during a frustrating all-nighter, and keeps up the farce, to himself at least.</p><div class="embed figure" data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.8"><figure class="embedded-video"><iframe src="http://www.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=jjhbu28ssu0ood6zntrutw" height="" width=""></iframe></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.9">As in <em>Parks and Rec</em>, Lowe&apos;s character is only fooling himself. No matter how often the people around him try to correct his delusion, he doesn&#x2019;t care. His resistance to truth is outstanding. On <em>Parks and Rec</em>, characters would stare blankly at the camera while he rapid-fired his bullets of enthusiasm at them. On <em>The Grinder</em>, his brother tries to bring him back to earth constantly, but Lowe is a determined helium balloon, floating up into the ether with chirpy gusto. Here&#x2019;s something Lowe says in <em>Parks and Rec</em>: &quot;I take care of my body above all else&#x2014;diet, exercise, supplements, positive thinking. Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born. I believe I am that human being.&quot; Crucially, in sitcom format, there is no growth in his characters. For Lowe, this is great. He is the personification of confidence&#x2014;or rather, a handsome sheen of confidence.</p><div class="embed figure" data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.a"><figure class="embedded-video"><iframe src="http://www.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=1lsyegcrnsc-4kwleppt-a" height="" width=""></iframe></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.b">It&#x2019;s his surface stuff&#x2014;looks, stature, rapid speech patterns, gusto&#x2014;that carries his sitcom characters. You sense there&#x2019;s a nothing-burger in there at best or, at worst, a tense ball of anxiety that&#x2019;s covered itself with layers of confidence, of tissue that might disintegrate if you poured water on them. This role could only be played, satisfyingly, by someone who distinctly isn&#x2019;t that, who has fought to avoid that. In his memoir <em>Stories I Only Tell My Friends</em>, Lowe writes about the shame he felt during a financially rough time for his family, when he had to use a camera strap as a belt. &quot;This is where my ability to ignore reality is a gift. I walk in like I&apos;m dressed like James Bond. No one says a word, and in fact, one girl asks where I got the cool belt. Fake confidence on the outside, as I will later learn, often trumps truthful turmoil on the inside.&quot; Rob Lowe can play a parody of this because, we know, Rob Lowe is a pretty water that runs deep. </p><p data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.c">As Amy Wallace argued in her <a href="rob-lowe-hollywood-reinvention-gq-cover"><em>GQ</em> profile of Lowe in September</a>, self-mocking was part of Lowe&#x2019;s transformation. His recovery from addiction had comedy baked into it. He appeared on <em>SNL</em> on March 17, 1990, the day he turned 26, and Dana Carvey&#x2019;s &#x201C;Church Lady&#x201D; scolded him for being promiscuous. A few weeks after that, he went to rehab. A certain level of caricature suits him; he makes his handsomeness palatable by throwing it into sharp relief. One of his best runs was actually in the DirectTV commercial series where he played a parade of characters called things like Far Less Attractive Rob Lowe and Painfully Awkward Rob Lowe and Super Creepy Rob Lowe. After witnessing their awful plights, Regular Rob Lowe would come on and encourage people to upgrade from cable. (Lowe also foregrounds this power to manipulate, sinisterly as his terrifying plastic-surgeon character in the Liberace biopic <em>Behind the Candelabra</em> and sleazily as a consultant mastermind in <em>Thank You for Smoking</em>.)</p><div class="embed figure" data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.d"><figure class="embedded-video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wl2uDi6Zju8" height="" width=""></iframe></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.4.e">In <em>The Grinder</em>&#x2019;s show-within-the-show, someone tells Rob Lowe&#x2019;s character&#x2019;s character, &#x201C;I want the real you, not the grinder, not this impenetrable god you need to be for everyone else!&#x201D; We don&#x2019;t want that from Lowe, though. The performance of maniacal pretty narcissism is precisely what we want&#x2014;just because we know he&#x2019;s more.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1stuo0gs074.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
