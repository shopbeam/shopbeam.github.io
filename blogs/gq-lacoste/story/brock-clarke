  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ATake a hapless Danish cartoonist with a fatwa on his head. Put an American secret agent with secrets of her own in charge of his well-being. Give her the half-baked idea of hiding said cartoonist in an upstate New York town, disguising him as a high-school guidance counselor. Turn up the emotional boil on love triangles and spy intrigue, then arm everybody with a gun…and there you have the premise of Brock Clarke\u0027s caroming, ripped-from-the-headlines new novel, entitled The Happiest People in the World, about how one ill-advised cartoon starring the prophet Mohammed sets in motion a wild chain of events that culminate in, among other things, an old-fashioned, Western shootout. Loaded with anti-heroes—including Matty the somewhat hapless principal lost in a haze of nostalgia, and his former mistress, Locs—Clarke\u0027s book may pull off a literary first: a novel that very much feels like the lovechild of Saul Bellow and Hogan\u0027s Heroes. And as much as The Happiest People in the World ranks as a suspenseful, absurdist romp that says as much perhaps about the American state of mind as Tocqueville\u0027s Democracy (ideas about free speech, religious intolerance, family, violence, marriage, and happiness, all rear their heads here), it\u0027s also written by an original novelist of fertile imagination who\u0027s quietly been etching an impressive oeuvre just outside the mainstream of American fiction. While readers may recognize Clarke\u0027s deft mix of dark comedy, big ideas, and yearning characters from previous novels like An Arsonist\u0027s Guide to Writer\u0027s Homes of New England and Exley, his new work finds the novelist juggling even more balls, attempting to genre-bend in the best—and most hilarious—way possible.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AThe beginning of this book is really wild and shocking—and I found myself hurtling through the next 300 pages to find out what happened way back there at the beginning. Did you write the beginning first or last? Without giving anything away, did it disturb you to write it?\u000A\u000A I wrote the beginning at the end, the very end, of writing the book. I realized the beginning I had didn\u0027t prepare the reader sufficiently for what was to come—the setting, the people, the comedy, the violence. So my editor had me watch a clip of the opening of Nathan Lane in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, an opening that makes comedy out of the fact that the comedy comes by way of willfully and futilely trying to ignore the horrible. And that, I realized, was what I needed to do at the beginning of The Happiest People.\u000A\u000AAs for it disturbing me: The writing, not so much. But that in order to make the writing better I had to turn to Stephen Sondheim, yes, it disturbed me, very much so.\u000A\u000AThis is a book about a whole bunch of things—America, free speech, religious intolerance, family, violence, marriage, happiness—and yet it all gets sucked into a voice that balances the ominous, profound, and humorous as if they were one thing. Is this an accurate reflection of your strategy as a writer, or how you think as a person proceeding through everyday American life?\u000A\u000A They are one thing, no? At least, that\u0027s how I see it. So, yeah, it\u0027s an accurate reflection of my strategy, insofar as I have one, because that\u0027s how I see things as the person I am proceeding through everyday American life. But also because I\u0027m not so much interested in, say, the humorous without the ominous grounding the humor. And the opposite is certainly true: that list you just wheeled out—America, free speech, religious intolerance, etc.—God, that sounds like it would lead to some ponderous, self-important, speechifying fiction, and maybe it has, or would, if the humor weren\u0027t there to make it otherwise.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Joe Hughes\u000A\u000ADid you ever fear that you might be playing with fire here, that you might end up a character in your own novel? That is, did you ever worry about the repercussions of writing about a fictional cartoonist who resembles a real cartoonist on whose head there is a very real fatwa? And what about your depiction of Muslim extremists, just in case there was a mullah or two who don\u0027t see the book the same way you do?\u000A\u000A I\u0027m only afraid when someone asks me if I\u0027m ever afraid. Because I don\u0027t see any Muslim extremists in the book: the people who burn down the cartoonist\u0027s house are mad at his absolute naive stupidity, and for not understanding or considering how mad his naive stupidity might make someone who does not look like him, and think like him, and believe what he believes. But they\u0027re not extremists; they\u0027re pissed off, but that does not make them extremists. Of course, they don\u0027t then think of the consequences of their pissed off house burning, which makes them a little bit naive, too. But then, that\u0027s my point: this is a novel about, among other things, the consequences of naivete. And I really hope I\u0027m not naive in thinking my readers will see that, too.\u000A\u000AI think of your novels and work in general as sort of wonderfully unclassifiable. How would you characterize the vein you\u0027re working in? Crypto-satire? Ridiculo-realism? Improbafiction?\u000A\u000A Improbafiction! Yes! That\u0027s exactly it. A reviewer said about my last book that it should have no chance of even being decent, let alone good. And that\u0027s the kind of book I always want to write: a book that should have no chance of being decent, let alone as good as I want to be, as good as I think it is. Improbafiction is exactly the term of for it. Until we come up with a better one.\u000A\u000AI know you\u0027re a huge Saul Bellow devotee, but is it possible that somewhere along the way, as a kid even, you found some literary value in shows like Get Smart, F Troop, or Hogan\u0027s Heroes?\u000A\u000A I like that: My work being an unholy union between the great Saul Bellow and the bad TV shows of my youth. Hogan\u0027s Heroes in particular. The suave pre-Family Feud Richard Dawson; Schultz with his \u0022I know nothing\u0022; Klink with his monocle. I learned a lot, in retrospect, from shows like that. Although I didn\u0027t know that at the time, and I wouldn\u0027t have known I\u0027d learned anything from Hogan\u0027s Heroes if I hadn\u0027t learned it from writers like Muriel Spark, who taught me that novels thrive when readers learn about characters by short hand—props, catch phrases, easily recognized defects—and also that novels thrive when they take what\u0027s useful from supposedly lesser art forms, like the spy novel, or in this case, Hogan\u0027s Heroes, which, I now realize, with the help of Muriel Spark, I learned a lot from.\u000A\u000AHave you written movie scripts before? This one feels like a perfect Coen brothers vehicle, actually.\u000A\u000A No, I haven\u0027t written scripts, but I think about Coen Brothers movies and Wes Anderson movies a lot—again, how their characters are embodied by one or two specific, telling qualities; how they structure their films; how the films often dabble in genres without totally drinking the genre Kool-aid; how the Coens in particular are in turn heartless and heartfelt.\u000A\u000AThere are dozens of characters in this book. Did you have fun killing them off?\u000A\u000A Yes! But only because I wanted to make sure that this didn\u0027t end up being some farce, some romp, with no consequences. Because for all the goofiness in this goofy book, there are people doing some grave, terrible things. I\u0027m thinking of Capo and his crew in particular: when he yells out at one point, \u0022The Great Game!\u0022 well, I wanted to make sure that he, and everyone else, was forced to realize that this wasn\u0027t a game, great or otherwise. Hence, the body count. Which was hard for me, honestly, I\u0027m kind of a squeamish person, and reader, and writer, and I do not enjoy carnage much. But I thought it was necessary for this book, and when I say, Yes, I had fun killing people off, I mean that I was pleased with myself for making myself do that when I really did not want to.\u000A\u000ADo you have any hope at all for American culture?\u000A\u000A Only insofar as Hogan\u0027s Heroes and Saul Bellow were a product of, and part of, American culture. They are our only signs of cultural well-being. \u000A\u000ACan you name the greatest (or stupidest) American invention/phenomenon that has you most intrigued at the moment?\u000A\u000A Those fucking plastic sticks with the claw on the end of it that people use to pick up and then fling their dogs\u0027 filthy, slobbered-on tennis balls rather than use their hands, which have been up to the task for as long as there have been dogs and things for them to fetch, until now. But no, I get it: it\u0027s important that our hands remain clean, so that we might be better able to operate our handheld devices.\u000A\u000ADo you think this novel will finally bring the people of Denmark and upper New York state the recognition they deserve? What recognition do they deserve?\u000A\u000A I just want them to recognize each other. Maybe there could be some sort of swap, where the happiest people in the world could be made to stay for a semester in the homes of the unhappiest people in the world, and the opposite. It\u0027d be like an academic program abroad, with nothing learned except how lucky you are, or aren\u0027t.\u000A\u000ACan you point to any other quasi-spy whodunnits that are deeply literary that might have guided you in the writing?\u000A\u000A Yes! Muriel Spark\u0027s Territorial Rights and Aiding and Abetting. Those for sure. Also, Graham Greene\u0027s Travels with My Aunt. Great books that should be read just as often, if not more often, than the other books by those authors that are more frequently called great.\u000A\u000AWhat next? A sci-fi Obama novel? An Amish SEAL team thriller? A comic tragedy pitting pro-gun lobbyists against Congress that ends in a huge shoot-up? \u000A\u000A Yes, to all of that, yes.",

Danish cartoonist with a fatwa on his head. Put an American secret agent with secrets of her own in charge of his well-being. Give her the half-baked idea of hiding said cartoonist in an upstate New York town, disguising him as a high-school guidance counselor. Turn up the emotional boil on love triangles and spy intrigue, then arm everybody with a <em>gun</em>&#x2026;and there you have<strong> </strong>the premise of Brock Clarke&apos;s caroming, ripped-from-the-headlines new novel, entitled <em>The Happiest People in the World</em>, about how one ill-advised cartoon starring the prophet Mohammed sets in motion a wild chain of events that culminate in, among other things, an old-fashioned, Western shootout. Loaded with anti-heroes&#x2014;including Matty the somewhat hapless principal lost in a haze of nostalgia, and his former mistress, Locs&#x2014;Clarke&apos;s book may pull off a literary first: a novel that very much feels like the lovechild of Saul Bellow and <em>Hogan&apos;s Heroes.</em> And as much as <em>The Happiest People in the World</em> ranks as a suspenseful, absurdist romp&#xA0;that says as much perhaps about the American state of mind as Tocqueville&apos;s <em>Democracy </em>(ideas about free speech, religious intolerance, family, violence, marriage, and happiness, all rear their heads here), it&apos;s also written by an original novelist of fertile imagination who&apos;s quietly been etching an impressive oeuvre just outside the mainstream of American fiction. While readers may recognize Clarke&apos;s deft mix of dark comedy, big ideas, and yearning characters from previous novels like <em>An Arsonist&apos;s Guide to Writer&apos;s Homes of New England</em> and <em>Exley</em>, his new work finds the novelist juggling even more balls, attempting to genre-bend in the best&#x2014;and most hilarious&#x2014;way possible.</p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>The beginning of this book is really wild and shocking&#x2014;and I found myself hurtling through the next 300 pages to find out what happened way back there at the beginning. Did you write the beginning first or last? Without giving anything away, did it disturb you to write it?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.5"> I wrote the beginning at the end, the very end, of writing the book. I realized the beginning I had didn&apos;t prepare the reader sufficiently for what was to come&#x2014;the setting, the people, the comedy, the violence. So my editor had me watch a clip of the opening of Nathan Lane in <em>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,</em> an opening that makes comedy out of the fact that the comedy comes by way of willfully and futilely trying to ignore the horrible. And that, I realized, was what I needed to do at the beginning of <em>The Happiest People.</em></p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.6">As for it disturbing me: The writing, not so much. But that in order to make the writing better I had to turn to Stephen Sondheim, yes, it disturbed me, very much so.</p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>This is a book about a whole bunch of things&#x2014;America, free speech, religious intolerance, family, violence, marriage, happiness&#x2014;and yet it all gets sucked into a voice that balances the ominous, profound, and humorous as if they were one thing. Is this an accurate reflection of your strategy as a writer, or how you think as a person proceeding through everyday American life?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.8"> They <em>are</em> one thing, no? At least, that&apos;s how I see it. So, yeah, it&apos;s an accurate reflection of my strategy, insofar as I have one, because that&apos;s how I see things as the person I am proceeding through everyday American life. But also because I&apos;m not so much interested in, say, the humorous without the ominous grounding the humor. And the opposite is certainly true: that list you just wheeled out&#x2014;America, free speech, religious intolerance, etc.&#x2014;God, that sounds like it would lead to some ponderous, self-important, speechifying fiction, and maybe it has, or would, if the humor weren&apos;t there to make it otherwise.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.9"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c39e1177d66d68d57914/master/w_806/entertainment-2014-11-the-happiest-people-in-the-world-brock-clarke-photo-credit-joe-hughes.jpg" alt="entertainment-2014-11-the-happiest-people-in-the-world-brock-clarke-photo-credit-joe-hughes.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbrock-clarke&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-the-happiest-people-in-the-world-brock-clarke-photo-credit-joe-hughes.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbrock-clarke&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-the-happiest-people-in-the-world-brock-clarke-photo-credit-joe-hughes.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbrock-clarke&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c39e1177d66d68d57914%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-the-happiest-people-in-the-world-brock-clarke-photo-credit-joe-hughes.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-the-happiest-people-in-the-world-brock-clarke-photo-credit-joe-hughes.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbrock-clarke&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c39e1177d66d68d57914%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-the-happiest-people-in-the-world-brock-clarke-photo-credit-joe-hughes.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-the-happiest-people-in-the-world-brock-clarke-photo-credit-joe-hughes.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Joe Hughes</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Did you ever fear that you might be playing with fire here, that you might end up a character in your own novel? That is, did you ever worry about the repercussions of writing about a fictional cartoonist who resembles a real cartoonist on whose head there is a very real fatwa? And what about your depiction of Muslim extremists, just in case there was a mullah or two who don&apos;t see the book the same way you do?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.b"> I&apos;m only afraid when someone asks me if I&apos;m ever afraid. Because I don&apos;t see any Muslim extremists in the book: the people who burn down the cartoonist&apos;s house are mad at his absolute naive stupidity, and for not understanding or considering how mad his naive stupidity might make someone who does not look like him, and think like him, and believe what he believes. But they&apos;re not extremists; they&apos;re pissed off, but that does not make them extremists. Of course, they don&apos;t then think of the consequences of their pissed off house burning, which makes them a little bit naive, too. But then, that&apos;s my point: this is a novel about, among other things, the consequences of naivete. And I really hope I&apos;m not naive in thinking my readers will see that, too.</p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>I think of your novels and work in general as sort of wonderfully unclassifiable. How would you characterize the vein you&apos;re working in? Crypto-satire? Ridiculo-realism? Improbafiction?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Improbafiction! Yes! That&apos;s exactly it. A reviewer said about my last book that it should have no chance of even being decent, let alone good. And that&apos;s the kind of book I always want to write: a book that should have no chance of being decent, let alone as good as I want to be, as good as I think it is. Improbafiction is exactly the term of for it. Until we come up with a better one.</p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>I know you&apos;re a huge Saul Bellow devotee, but is it possible that somewhere along the way, as a kid even, you found some literary value in shows like <em>Get Smart,</em> <em>F Troop, </em>or <em>Hogan&apos;s Heroes?</em></strong></p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.f"> I like that: My work being an unholy union between the great Saul Bellow and the bad TV shows of my youth. <em>Hogan&apos;s Heroes</em> in particular. The suave pre-<em>Family Feud</em> Richard Dawson; Schultz with his &quot;I know nothing&quot;; Klink with his monocle. I learned a lot, in retrospect, from shows like that. Although I didn&apos;t know that at the time, and I wouldn&apos;t have known I&apos;d learned anything from <em>Hogan&apos;s Heroes</em> if I hadn&apos;t learned it from writers like Muriel Spark, who taught me that novels thrive when readers learn about characters by short hand&#x2014;props, catch phrases, easily recognized defects&#x2014;and also that novels thrive when they take what&apos;s useful from supposedly lesser art forms, like the spy novel, or in this case, Hogan&apos;s Heroes, which, I now realize, with the help of Muriel Spark, I learned a lot from.</p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Have you written movie scripts before? This one feels like a perfect Coen brothers vehicle, actually.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.h"> No, I haven&apos;t written scripts, but I think about Coen Brothers movies and Wes Anderson movies a lot&#x2014;again, how their characters are embodied by one or two specific, telling qualities; how they structure their films; how the films often dabble in genres without totally drinking the genre Kool-aid; how the Coens in particular are in turn heartless and heartfelt.</p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>There are dozens of characters in this book. Did you have fun killing them off?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.j"> Yes! But only because I wanted to make sure that this didn&apos;t end up being some farce, some romp, with no consequences. Because for all the goofiness in this goofy book, there are people doing some grave, terrible things. I&apos;m thinking of Capo and his crew in particular: when he yells out at one point, &quot;The Great Game!&quot; well, I wanted to make sure that he, and everyone else, was forced to realize that this wasn&apos;t a game, great or otherwise. Hence, the body count. Which was hard for me, honestly, I&apos;m kind of a squeamish person, and reader, and writer, and I do not enjoy carnage much. But I thought it was necessary for this book, and when I say, Yes, I had fun killing people off, I mean that I was pleased with myself for making myself do that when I really did not want to.</p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Do you have any hope at all for American culture?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.l"> Only insofar as <em>Hogan&apos;s Heroes</em> and Saul Bellow were a product of, and part of, American culture.

But no, I get it: it&apos;s important that our hands remain clean, so that we might be better able to operate our handheld devices.</p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>Do you think this novel will finally bring the people of Denmark and upper New York state the recognition they deserve? What recognition do they deserve?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.p"> I just want them to recognize each other. Maybe there could be some sort of swap, where the happiest people in the world could be made to stay for a semester in the homes of the unhappiest people in the world, and the opposite. It&apos;d be like an academic program abroad, with nothing learned except how lucky you are, or aren&apos;t.</p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>Can you point to any other quasi-spy whodunnits that are deeply literary that might have guided you in the writing?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.r"> Yes! Muriel Spark&apos;s <em>Territorial Right</em>s and <em>Aiding and Abetting</em>. Those for sure. Also, Graham Greene&apos;s <em>Travels with My Aunt. </em>Great books that should be read just as often, if not more often, than the other books by those authors that are more frequently called great.</p><p data-reactid=".19slo70njsw.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>What next?
