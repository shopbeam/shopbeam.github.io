  	    "articleBody": "Photos: See Jaden Smith Wear Fall\u0027s Trippiest Clothes\u000A\u000AJaden Smith has a game he likes to play whenever he\u0027s in public, or whenever he\u0027s stating something that will eventually become public—such as right now—and the game goes like this. It starts with him saying something Jaden-like. For example:\u000A\u000A\u0022Me and my sister started this initiative called Mystery School. It dates back to like ancient Egypt, ancient Greece—like Plato, Pythagoras, all these students had mystery schools. And what they learned in there was sacred. They would learn the math and sciences of that generation, and then they would build the cities and give that energy and that knowledge to the other people. And a lot of stuff they would keep really, really to themselves. Like, you couldn\u0027t say the word dodecahedron, which is just a shape, outside of one of the mystery schools or they would, like, kill you or whatever. Because it was such a sacred shape.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe next part of the game is: He waits. He watches you react. He\u0027s 17 and has already been famous so long that there are red-carpet photos of him he doesn\u0027t remember posing for. There are paparazzi photos of him and his sister, Willow, in strollers. There are photos of him right here at the Calabasas Commons, the strip mall near his house that he favors because of the Pain Quotidien and the Barnes &amp; Noble and the movie theater and the juice spot. Every day, basically: a flip-book of Jaden Smith slowly aging, as told by strangers\u0027 cameras. With his long California-drought-colored T-shirt and red-and-black leggings and his fine Smith-family features, he looks like a mischievous sorcerer\u0027s apprentice, which he sort of is. He\u0027s got the ease of a kid to whom the world has belonged for as long as he\u0027s known the world.\u000A\u000A\u0022Me and Willow are scientists,\u0022 he explains, \u0022so everything for us is a scientific test upon humanity. And luckily we\u0027re put in a position where we can affect large groups of human beings at one time.\u0022 Fame is their lab, is what he\u0027s saying, and we are the subjects. He\u0027ll get on Twitter and tweet something like \u0022The Biggest Flex Anyone Will Ever Have Is Dying.\u0022 Or the T Magazine interview they did last year, the one that left everyone convinced they were drunk on prana energy: \u0022That experiment—it went really, really well,\u0022 he tells me. \u0022We got to see how people reacted. And they actually ended up reacting exactly as we predicted beforehand that they would react.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe gives a sly smile. \u0022It\u0027s fun, bro. That\u0027s what a lot of people don\u0027t realize. It\u0027s fun. It\u0027s so much fun. It\u0027s the best thing. People think you\u0027re crazy—I feel like it\u0027s an honor, actually, for people to think I\u0027m crazy. Because they thought Galileo was crazy, too, you know what I\u0027m saying? I don\u0027t think I\u0027m as revolutionary as Galileo, but I don\u0027t think I\u0027m not as revolutionary as Galileo.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s the middle of a heat wave in Los Angeles, and we\u0027re sitting outside Le Pain Quotidien. He orders oatmeal. I guess this is another way of emphasizing that he\u0027s still only 17. The oatmeal arrives and he spoons it into his mouth and then he starts pointing at his mouth and frantically waving his arms. \u0022Extremely hot,\u0022 he says eventually.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s 95 degrees outside and you\u0027re eating oatmeal.\u000A\u000A\u0022Definitely. Definitely. Yeah. That wasn\u0027t the best idea.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe puts the spoon aside. \u0022Let\u0027s walk,\u0022 he says. We walk past a Sephora and a Starbucks and a cell-phone store, past the usual dazed couples and harried moms that come to strip malls at noon on a weekday. \u0022One day this will be the Calabasas Walk of Fame,\u0022 Jaden says. \u0022Everybody that lives around here, which is pretty much everybody that\u0027s in the news, they all come here.\u0022 The Kardashian-Jenners live around here. Kanye and Kim. Drake. You might count his parents, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, too, if you\u0027re talking about people in the news. We walk past the Barnes &amp; Noble and the Citibank and the sushi joint and a bunch of potted trees. The bland anonymous psychic terrain of a teenage space wizard.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s the most driven young rich kid you might ever meet. He\u0027s 17 and curious. He\u0027s not passive. He doesn\u0027t sleep in. All he wants to do is make things. He\u0027s in Baz Luhrmann\u0027s new Netflix show, The Get Down, about New York in the late \u002770s—he plays a Basquiat-like graffiti writer—so he\u0027s learning about the era. DJ\u0027ing, breakdancing, disco, voguing, graffiti. He\u0027s got a radio show on Beats 1. He\u0027s studying Photoshop, to be a better clothing designer. He just put LED lights in his bedroom so that it looks like space. He\u0027s working on his third album. He\u0027s making things, constantly. \u0022Like, the clothes I\u0027m wearing right now, done it on my own. I built my own bed, I built my own closet, um, I built two closets, I built four beds, I built, um, one pyramid—\u0022\u000A\u000AWait, did you just say you built a pyramid?\u000A\u000A\u0022One pyramid, yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhere is the pyramid?\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s at my parents\u0027 house. Half of a pyramid. The tip is missing, but the whole structural thing is built, and it sits at 12.5 feet tall. I\u0027ll Instagram a picture of it once this comes out, so people know what I\u0027m talking about.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhy 12.5?\u000A\u000A\u0022Because it\u0027s supposed to be 14 feet tall or 16 feet tall, but the tip of the Giza pyramid is actually cut off. There\u0027s no tip. It\u0027s missing. So I was like, ‘I want to have a missing tip on here, too.\u0027 Because I copied the exact 57.1 degrees that the Giza pyramid is. Obviously I don\u0027t have two miniature pyramids next to it. But I have a little pyramid in my actual room, too. One that\u0027s just like three feet tall.\u0022\u000A\u000AHow did your parents react to you building a pyramid in their backyard? Were they just like, \u0022Go for it\u0022?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. Yeah. They always told us to, like, be and do whatever we want.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AMystery School is real, as it happens. It\u0027s how he and Willow refer to their home school. That\u0027s where he learned how to build a pyramid. They help set their own curriculum. \u0022And that\u0027s what I really encourage kids to do, is learn the things that you want to learn, because then not only will school become fun, but it will make your dreams come true.\u0022 Their hope is to inspire other kids to make their dreams come true, too. We can acknowledge here the unacknowledged privilege of that desire without condemning the desire itself. Things are possible for Jaden Smith in a way they\u0027re not possible for 99.999 percent of the population, yes. But he\u0027s out here doing bizarre and fascinating things with the opportunity. \u0022I rarely go to parties. My whole life is just dedicated on learning and breaking, like, the craziest records of life, and being like one of the craziest human beings to ever exist. That\u0027s me.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s him! He\u0027s young and a little crazy and obsessed with learning. \u0022No summer break, no weekends. We learn every single day.\u0022\u000A\u000ADo you ever think about college?\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ll go to college. I want to set up offices at MIT just so I can learn and bring in new technologies into the world. Definitely sit in on lectures in college. I\u0027ve done that already. Like, go sit in that, you know, USC, UCLA, MIT, you know, anything I can get my hands on.\u0022\u000A\u000AHis goal in life is simple: \u0022I just want to teach people how to be comfortable. Stop being so scared.\u0022 Wear a dress maybe, like he has. Study something no one told you to study. Tweet the first thing that comes into your head.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ll go to open schools, eventually, when I\u0027m like 25 or something. Multiple schools. At the same time, around the world. So, like, two in the United States, two in Europe, two in China, India, Russia, Africa, all at the same time.\u0022\u000A\u000ALike your Mystery School, but for more people?\u000A\u000A\u0022Mmm-hmm.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAsk him what he wants to be when he grows up and he\u0027ll look at you almost with pity. As if age just takes the imagination out of you with a two-by-four. \u0022There\u0027s no end of the process,\u0022 he explains. \u0022Life is a process. At the end of the process, hopefully I\u0027ll be dead, you know. Hopefully I just won\u0027t be alive anymore. But I won\u0027t. Because that\u0027s when the process will end. It\u0027s an ongoing journey that you\u0027ll never reach the end of. I\u0027ll never read every single book, or go to every single place. But I\u0027ll die in the trying of it.\u0022\u000A\u000ADo you think about where you\u0027ll be ten years from now?\u000A\u000A\u0022Gone.\u0022\u000A\u000AGone?!\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. Gone.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat does that mean, \u0022Gone\u0022?\u000A\u000A\u0022No one will know where I am in ten years. They\u0027ll see me pop up, but they\u0027ll be like, ‘Where\u0027d you come from?\u0027 No one will know. No one will know where I\u0027m at. No one will know who I\u0027m with. No one will know what I\u0027m doing. I\u0027ve been planning that since I was like 13.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027ll go like this, he says: \u0022It\u0027ll be kind of like Banksy. But in a different way. More of a social impact. Helping people. But through art installations. It\u0027ll be like, ‘This just happened that helped a bunch of people over here. We don\u0027t know who did it, but these symbols and things were left around, so we can only guess that it\u0027s Jaden and the squad.\u0027 You know what I\u0027m saying? So I\u0027m just dedicating my whole life to helping the world.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s what he\u0027s like: big heart, big talker, big ideas. Remember: It\u0027s all one big experiment anyway. So this is how he says good-bye:\u000A\u000A\u0022Let me think. What do I want to say right now? Love yourself. And watch.\u0022\u000A\u000AWatch Jaden?\u000A\u000A\u0022No. Don\u0027t watch Jaden.\u0022\u000A\u000ALove yourself and watch what, then?\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m gonna say it one more time. Love yourself. And watch.\u0022\u000A\u000AAll right.\u000A\u000A\u0022Don\u0027t watch Jaden.\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027m gonna be in the car, being like, \u0022What the fuck did that mean?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. Yeah. I want you to. I want you to be.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd then he walks away.\u000A\u000AZach Baron is GQ\u0027s staff writer  \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARead More:Most Stylish Men: Jaden SmithSix Style Moves to Steal From Jaden Smith",

actor-rapper-philosopher talks to writer Zach Baron about pyramids, Galileo, and growing up Smith</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.0"><strong><a href="../gallery/jaden-smith-dress-gq-photos">Photos: See Jaden Smith Wear Fall&#x2019;s Trippiest Clothes</a></strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.1"><strong>Jaden Smith has a game</strong> he likes to play whenever he&apos;s in public, or whenever he&apos;s stating something that will eventually become public&#x2014;such as right now&#x2014;and the game goes like this. It starts with him saying something Jaden-like. For example:</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#x201C;Me and my sister started this initiative called Mystery School. It dates back to like ancient Egypt, ancient Greece&#x2014;like Plato, Pythagoras, all these students had mystery schools. And what they learned in there was sacred. They would learn the math and sciences of that generation, and then they would build the cities and give that energy and that knowledge to the other people. And a lot of stuff they would keep really, really to themselves. Like, you couldn&apos;t say the word <em>dodecahedron</em>, which is just a shape, outside of one of the mystery schools or they would, like, kill you or whatever. Because it was such a sacred shape.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.3">The next part of the game is: He waits. He watches you react. He&apos;s 17 and has already been famous so long that there are red-carpet photos of him he doesn&apos;t remember posing for. There are paparazzi photos of him and his sister, Willow, in strollers. There are photos of him right here at the Calabasas Commons, the strip mall near his house that he favors because of the Pain Quotidien and the Barnes &amp; Noble and the movie theater and the juice spot. Every day, basically: a flip-book of Jaden Smith slowly aging, as told by strangers&apos; cameras. With his long California-drought-colored T-shirt and red-and-black leggings and his fine Smith-family features, he looks like a mischievous sorcerer&apos;s apprentice, which he sort of is. He&apos;s got the ease of a kid to whom the world has belonged for as long as he&apos;s known the world.</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.5">&#x201C;Me and Willow are scientists,&#x201D; he explains, &#x201C;so everything for us is a scientific test upon humanity. And luckily we&apos;re put in a position where we can affect large groups of human beings at one time.&#x201D; Fame is their lab, is what he&apos;s saying, and we are the subjects. He&apos;ll get on Twitter and tweet something like &#x201C;The Biggest Flex Anyone Will Ever Have Is Dying.&#x201D; Or the <em>T Magazine</em> interview they did last year, the one that left everyone convinced they were drunk on prana energy: &#x201C;That experiment&#x2014;it went really, really well,&#x201D; he tells me. &#x201C;We got to see how people reacted. And they actually ended up reacting exactly as we predicted beforehand that they would react.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.6">He gives a sly smile. &#x201C;It&apos;s fun, bro. That&apos;s what a lot of people don&apos;t realize. It&apos;s fun. It&apos;s so much fun. It&apos;s the best thing. People think you&apos;re crazy&#x2014;I feel like it&apos;s an honor, actually, for people to think I&apos;m crazy. Because they thought Galileo was crazy, too, you know what I&apos;m saying? I don&apos;t think I&apos;m as revolutionary as Galileo, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;m <em>not</em> as revolutionary as Galileo.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.7"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>It&apos;s the middle</strong> of a heat wave in Los Angeles, and we&apos;re sitting outside Le Pain Quotidien. He orders oatmeal. I guess this is another way of emphasizing that he&apos;s still only 17. The oatmeal arrives and he spoons it into his mouth and then he starts pointing at his mouth and frantically waving his arms. &#x201C;Extremely hot,&#x201D; he says eventually.</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.9"><em>It&apos;s 95 degrees outside and you&apos;re eating oatmeal.</em></p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.a">&#x201C;Definitely. Definitely. Yeah. That wasn&apos;t the best idea.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.b">He puts the spoon aside. &#x201C;Let&apos;s walk,&#x201D; he says. We walk past a Sephora and a Starbucks and a cell-phone store, past the usual dazed couples and harried moms that come to strip malls at noon on a weekday. &#x201C;One day this will be the Calabasas Walk of Fame,&#x201D; Jaden says. &#x201C;Everybody that lives around here, which is pretty much everybody that&apos;s in the news, they all come here.&#x201D; The Kardashian-Jenners live around here. Kanye and Kim. Drake. You might count his parents, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, too, if you&apos;re talking about people in the news. We walk past the Barnes &amp; Noble and the Citibank and the sushi joint and a bunch of potted trees. The bland anonymous psychic terrain of a teenage space wizard.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>He&apos;s the most driven</strong> young rich kid you might ever meet. He&apos;s 17 and curious. He&apos;s not passive. He doesn&apos;t sleep in. All he wants to do is make things. He&apos;s in Baz Luhrmann&apos;s new Netflix show, <em>The Get Down,</em> about New York in the late &apos;70s&#x2014;he plays a Basquiat-like graffiti writer&#x2014;so he&apos;s learning about the era. DJ&apos;ing, breakdancing, disco, voguing, graffiti. He&apos;s got a radio show on Beats 1. He&apos;s studying Photoshop, to be a better clothing designer. He just put LED lights in his bedroom so that it looks like space. He&apos;s working on his third album. He&apos;s making things, constantly. &#x201C;Like, the clothes I&apos;m wearing right now, done it on my own. I built my own bed, I built my own closet, um, I built two closets, I built four beds, I built, um, one pyramid&#x2014;&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.e"><em>Wait, did you just say you built a pyramid?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.f">&#x201C;One pyramid, yeah.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.g"><em>Where is the pyramid?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.h">&#x201C;It&apos;s at my parents&apos; house. Half of a pyramid. The tip is missing, but the whole structural thing is built, and it sits at 12.5 feet tall. I&apos;ll Instagram a picture of it once this comes out, so people know what I&apos;m talking about.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.i"><em>Why 12.5?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.j">&#x201C;Because it&apos;s supposed to be 14 feet tall or 16 feet tall, but the tip of the Giza pyramid is actually cut off. There&apos;s no tip. It&apos;s missing. So I was like, &#x2018;I want to have a missing tip on here, too.&#x2019; Because I copied the exact 57.1 degrees that the Giza pyramid is. Obviously I don&apos;t have two miniature pyramids next to it. But I have a little pyramid in my actual room, too. One that&apos;s just like three feet tall.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.k"><em>How did your parents react to you building a pyramid in their backyard? Were they just like, &#x201C;Go for it&#x201D;?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.l">&#x201C;Yeah. Yeah. They always told us to, like, be and do whatever we want.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.m"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>Mystery School is real</strong>, as it happens. It&apos;s how he and Willow refer to their home school. That&apos;s where he learned how to build a pyramid. They help set their own curriculum. &#x201C;And that&apos;s what I really encourage kids to do, is learn the things that you want to learn, because then not only will school become fun, but it will make your dreams come true.&#x201D; Their hope is to inspire other kids to make their dreams come true, too. We can acknowledge here the unacknowledged privilege of that desire without condemning the desire itself. Things are possible for Jaden Smith in a way they&apos;re not possible for 99.999 percent of the population, yes. But he&apos;s out here doing bizarre and fascinating things with the opportunity. &#x201C;I rarely go to parties. My whole life is just dedicated on learning and breaking, like, the craziest records of life, and being like one of the craziest human beings to ever exist. That&apos;s me.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.o">That&apos;s him! He&apos;s young and a little crazy and obsessed with learning. &#x201C;No summer break, no weekends. We learn every single day.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.p"><em>Do you ever think about college?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.q">&#x201C;I&apos;ll go to college. I want to set up offices at MIT just so I can learn and bring in new technologies into the world. Definitely sit in on lectures in college. I&apos;ve done that already. Like, go sit in that, you know, USC, UCLA, MIT, you know, anything I can get my hands on.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.r">His goal in life is simple: &#x201C;I just want to teach people how to be comfortable. Stop being so scared.&#x201D; Wear a dress maybe, like he has. Study something no one told you to study. Tweet the first thing that comes into your head.</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.s">&#x201C;I&apos;ll go to open schools, eventually, when I&apos;m like 25 or something. Multiple schools. At the same time, around the world. So, like, two in the United States, two in Europe, two in China, India, Russia, Africa, all at the same time.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.t"><em>Like your Mystery School, but for more people</em>?</p><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.u">&#x201C;Mmm-hmm.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.v"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1mwpl26brwg.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong>Ask him what he wants</strong> to be when he grows up and he&apos;ll look at you almost with pity.

At the end of the process, hopefully I&apos;ll be dead, you know. Hopefully I just won&apos;t be alive anymore. But I won&apos;t. Because that&apos;s when the process will end. It&apos;s an ongoing journey that you&apos;ll never reach the end of. I&apos;ll never read every single book, or go to every single place.

We don&apos;t know who did it, but these symbols and things were left around, so we can only guess that it&apos;s Jaden and the squad.&#x2019; You know what I&apos;m saying?
