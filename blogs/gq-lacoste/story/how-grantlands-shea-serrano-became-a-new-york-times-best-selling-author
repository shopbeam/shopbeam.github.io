  	    "articleBody": "If you were to draw a triple Venn diagram of hoops, trunk bangers, and jokes made at the expense of J. Cole, Grantland writer Shea Serrano would be smack-dab in the center, probably wearing a Tim Duncan jersey. He\u0027s one of the funniest follows on Twitter, and has been described to me by several people—he used to write stuff for GQ—as one of the nicest humans alive. Now, the father of three is officially one of the rare nice humans to make The New York Times best-selling authors list with The Rap Year Book, which debuted on October 13 and chronicles the most important song every year since 1979. \u000A\u000AThis accomplishment is no accident. It was engineered through sheer force of tweets with a lob from a militia of ride-or-die Twitter fans, who gobbled up the book wherever they could get it. We caught up with Shea for a phoner after his book tour and asked him how the hell he got here. \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: So how do you even get on The New York Times best-seller list? It\u0027s all such a mystery. Is there like a number you\u0027ve gotta hit?Shea Serrano: I don\u0027t understand it either. The only things I know are: you got to sell a lot of books, and you gotta make some noise. Those are the two guidelines my publisher told me. There\u0027s no set number you have to hit. There\u0027s just no way to know. You just do those two things and cross your fingers.\u000A\u000AWhen you become a best-selling Times author, do they give you anything tangible? Like a trophy or something?   I don\u0027t think so. The is the first time it\u0027s happened for me. I dunno. That\u0027d be cool if they sent me something like a top hat that I can wear and then everybody will automatically know.\u000A\u000Ahttps://twitter.com/SheaSerrano/status/657288677412868096\u000A\u000ADuring your victory lap on Twitter you keep talking about how you sort of stumbled into this whole writing thing. How\u0027d you become a writer in the first place? What was your big break?The way I ended up getting started in writing is my wife was pregnant with twins. This was around 2008. And the plan was she was gonna stay home for six months after the kids were born. We needed to save up some money to do that. She was a teacher at the time, and I was a teacher at the time. \u000A\u000ASo we we\u0027re starting to save up all our money, and about four months in, she went into labor. It was this crazy thing. They rushed to the hospital, they had to do this surgery to keep the babies from coming out. It was a big ordeal, right. They told her you can\u0027t go back to work. You have to just lay down. You\u0027re on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy.\u000A\u000ASo I needed another job, you know? We had the money saved up for the six months after the babies came. But we were using it already during the pregnancy for bills. We were gonna run out. \u000A\u000AI needed another job. I tried going to Target and Walmart, different restaurants to be a waiter. But nobody would hire me because I already had a full-time job. I was just literally at home Googling \u0022work from home jobs.\u0022 Writer was one of them.\u000A\u000AClicking those \u0022make $80/hour working from home\u0022 spam comments and all that.Yeah, stuff like that, you know! I saw \u0022writer\u0022 was one of them. I said, well, I guess I\u0027m a writer now. I just started calling up local newspapers and telling them I was a writer. That\u0027s really all you have to do: You just gotta say you\u0027re a thing, and people will think you\u0027re that thing.\u000A\u000A\u0022I tried going to Target and Walmart, different restaurants to be a waiter. But nobody would hire me because I already had a full-time job. I was just literally at home Googling \u0027work from home jobs.\u0027 \u0027Writer\u0027 was one of them.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000AWhat was your first clip?The very first thing I wrote was for a place called the Near Northwest Banner. Not even fucking Northwest Banner. The Near Northwest Banner. It was a neighborhood newspaper that this woman was printing up out of her garage, and then handing them out in the neighborhood. She had seen something I had written in a little blog thing that was on ESPN. There\u0027s this guy—his name was Henry Abbott, and he was running this site called TrueHoop. He saw a thing I wrote, and he posted it on there. And I guess she went through that and she found me. So she asked me to write about sports for her.\u000A\u000ASo I said all right. The first thing I ever did for her was a thing about the Astros. Craig Biggio was retiring at the time. That was the first thing I got paid to write. She paid me $15 for it.\u000A\u000AIt was crazy, so I did that twice. She did the paper once a month. I did it twice and I was like, Man, fuck this old lady. It\u0027s time to move on. I used those two clips to try to get on at other places, you know? \u000A\u000AI remember a few years ago I saw that Rap Coloring Book you did with Bun B percolating on Tumblr everywhere. How\u0027d you fall into that?I flipped the Near Northwest Banner job into a job at the Houston Press, which is the weekly paper here in Houston. So I was, like, trying to figure out my way around writing. I needed a way I could get consistent work. I noticed that the paper there was mostly all white dudes, and they were all writing about the local rock scene or whatever. And every once in awhile there was a rap thing, but not really; not too much was going on. I said, I\u0027m gonna make this my beat. And I just started going to every rap show that was in town. Not like when Kanye West was in town. Like the local little guy.\u000A\u000ASo I was going to all these different shows, and when you go to enough shows eventually you run into Bun B. I ran into him once. And then again and again. I just became like, Oh, what\u0027s up? It was a \u0022he knew my name\u0022 sort of situation. I did that for maybe two or three years, I think. Like I was that dude in Houston who covered the local rap scene.\u000A\u000AHe hit me up one day because he wanted to do a book. He was like, I feel like I should do a book and I know you\u0027re covering rap, so let\u0027s work on something together. I originally thought he wanted like a UGK biography. But he wanted to do something fun, something silly. I didn\u0027t want to do anything serious.\u000A\u000AWe were just pitching ideas back and forth and I hit him with the coloring book thing. He was all for it. It\u0027s hard to explain to a publisher, Hey, we\u0027re gonna do a coloring book about rappers! Who\u0027s gonna buy that shit? So I did the website. And I said I\u0027m gonna try to build a following, and then I can show the people. It went viral. In a little less than a week it took off.\u000A\u000AAbrams, my publisher, they saw it in the Approval Matrix in New York Magazine. They saw us there and then they hit us up, and we turned it into a book. That happened around 2012. I started it end of October and by beginning of November we were already out of there.\u000A\u000ASo while all of this was going on, you were still teaching in the day? How\u0027d you pull that off? I get slumped after a few hours at the office.By then I had already been writing for a couple of years. Three or four years. I\u0027m super... organized with work stuff. I have a set schedule. Every day my schedule is exactly the same. \u000A\u000A\u0022I just started calling up local newspapers and telling them I was a writer. That\u0027s really all you have to do: You just gotta say you\u0027re a thing, and people will think you\u0027re that thing.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000AWhen I\u0027m teaching I\u0027ll get up at 5:45 or whatever and get ready to go to school. Get there an hour early, do my school stuff. Teach during the day, do my coaching after school. Then I get home and I\u0027m with the kids from like 6:30 to 9. Then I\u0027m with the wife from 9 to 10:30. And then from 10:30 to 2 or 3 or whatever I\u0027m writing. I just had that schedule. If you have a set time, like I can only write during this set time? You can get a lot done because you\u0027re not gonna dick around.\u000A\u000AOnce I had the schedule going it was not a problem. There were nights where you ended up staying up all night, that sorta thing. But that\u0027s just part of it. I gotta provide, fucking, 15 meals a day! I\u0027m responsible for 15 meals. [Laughs] You just do it.\u000A\u000AHow\u0027d you get to Grantland?They reached out to me. I [was still at] the Houston Press, and I did a story there about Trey tha Truth. He was suing a local radio station—they had banned him, and it was this whole big thing. But that was the first story I did that went national. After that, I used that momentum to flip it into a job with the LA Weekly, the sister paper to the Houston Press but still the biggest one in the chain. \u000A\u000ASo I was writing to them, and I was doing a weekly thing there. And I wrote this essay about having sex with my wife while listening to Drake. \u000A\u000AThat one spread around a whole bunch. A woman from Grantland named Molly Lambert saw it. She passed it to the editors, they liked it. After that I got a message from them that said: You wanna come try to pitch us?\u000A\u000AAt that point Grantland was already around for a couple of years. They had like Pulitzer Prize winners and New York Times people. I had never considered pitching them. I didn\u0027t have an in. I didn\u0027t know anybody over there. Molly made that shit happen. \u000A\u000AWhat was your first story for Grantland? The first one was about gift shopping with 2Chainz. It was just about trying to find a present for my wife, I think. I was real nervous, whatever. I was like: I\u0027m gonna pitch one idea every two weeks. And then I\u0027m trying to do one a week. You start working your way in there.\u000A\u000AI freelanced for them for like a year and a half. And then a guy there named Dan, who does all the contract stuff hit me up and said, Let\u0027s try to get you here only writing. We just want you to write for us. We don\u0027t want your name nowhere else. That kind of thing. \u000A\u000AWas there an \u0022aw, shit\u0022 moment that everything hit you?It\u0027s different via email because you don\u0027t have to look at anybody\u0027s face. They had a big meeting in L.A. and all the big basketball writers were out there and they asked me to come. It was the first time I had ever been to L.A. I go, and I\u0027m meeting everyone in the office for the first time. And there\u0027s this big boardroom type thing with a big table in there and everyone walks in and sits down. Bill Simmons walks in. Like, he\u0027s fucking Bill Simmons! And there\u0027s Zach Lowe. And it\u0027s Andrew Sharp. And Jason Concepcion. These guys I knew and had seen and who are the best basketball writers. And all of a sudden I\u0027m sitting at this table with them, supposed to pitch ideas behind these guys. And I\u0027m just like, What the fuck? What the fuck is happening right now?\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s like, how do you handle that, you know? I\u0027m still waiting for them to figure out that I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing. \u000A\u000AYou just got home to Houston, right? I\u0027m guessing you\u0027re not even thinking about your next book yet.I\u0027m gonna try to not do anything with a book for a couple of months. Because you know what ends up happening... when we did this book, when we started out I didn\u0027t feel any pressure at all. Because nobody was expecting the book to do anything. It was just, Oh, we\u0027ll sell a thousand copies the first week, and that will be a big success for us. That sort of situation.\u000A\u000AAnd then when it started to take off, it turned in from us being a joke saying \u0022We\u0027re gonna make the New York Times!\u0022 to a real \u0022You guys might have a shot at this.\u0022 \u000A\u000AWhen that happened, all of a sudden there are pressures and expectations, you know? If I\u0027m doing all this jabber, I\u0027m running my mouth, and now if I don\u0027t make it, I don\u0027t wanna be that guy.\u000A\u000AI knew we were gonna be close when I saw how many books we were selling. I also knew that if we don\u0027t make it, the first week is your best chance to make it. There\u0027s not gonna be a big splash after that. I probably got at least another two to three years before I get another shot, and I don\u0027t want to have three years of me walking into a room and them saying like, \u0022He didn\u0027t make it.\u0022 Nobody\u0027s gonna say that. Nobody cares. But in my head they\u0027re gonna be saying that when I walk in, and there was a lot of pressure there.\u000A\u000ANow I know when we do this next book, now it\u0027s gonna be like, Yo, can you do it again? \u000A\u000A\u0022Can you lead the league in scoring again? The team could could really use it.\u0022And it\u0027s fucking hard, man! Like people were just coming out of their mouths like it\u0027s not a thing, like, \u0022Oh! You\u0027re gonna make The New York Times best-seller list!\u0022 You don\u0027t understand how impossible it is when 10,000 books come out every Tuesday and you gotta be in the top 15. Like do you understand how hard that is? They were just saying that like it was nothing. [Laughs]\u000A\u000AAnd I was just feeling more and more pressure. I don\u0027t wanna come home and tell my wife we didn\u0027t make it. She wouldn\u0027t care. But I would still have to say it. \u000A\u000Ahttps://twitter.com/SheaSerrano/status/658416631874392064\u000A\u000AHave you gotten anything crazy from your fans who are sending you pictures with the book?My favorite thing was we were in L.A., this guy showed up to the signing and he had a bag with him. I wasn\u0027t even paying any attention, but he grabbed the bag and set it on the table. And he took out a fucking jacket from 1980-something—a Chalk Line sports jacket with David Robinson. \u000A\u000AI\u0027m a big Spurs fan. It\u0027s David Robinson: this goofy, fluorescent jacket that he found at a thrift store. He paid like eight or nine bucks for it. But he saw it and he bought it and he brought it to me. And that was the best thing that happened at that signing. \u000A\u000AI wore it the whole rest of the trip. \u000A\u000AThis is unrelated to everything else, but: Do you get weird emails from J. Cole\u0027s people at all?I do. Not his people. But, like, his fans. They hit me up all the time. They\u0027re like, \u0022I was hoping we could have an educated discussion.\u0022 No you weren\u0027t. You just wanted to tell me you think I\u0027m stupid.\u000A\u000ASo he\u0027s not actually on your phone, and you don\u0027t casually text with him?No. [Laughs] I don\u0027t. One of my buddies is buddies with him. He\u0027ll send me messages once in awhile and text me that I\u0027m giving him shit. I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t even know I\u0027m alive.",

at the expense of J. Cole, <em>Grantland</em> writer Shea Serrano would be smack-dab in the center, probably wearing a Tim Duncan jersey. He&#x2019;s one of the funniest follows on Twitter, and has been described to me by several people&#x2014;<a href="../contributor/shea-serrano">he used to write stuff for GQ</a>&#x2014;as one of the nicest humans alive. Now, the father of three is officially one of the rare nice humans to make <em>The New York Times</em> best-selling authors list with <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Rap-Year-Book-Deconstructed/dp/1419718185">The Rap Year Book</a></em>, which debuted on October 13 and chronicles the most <a href="shea-serrano-rap-year-book">important song every year since 1979</a>. </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.1">This accomplishment is no accident. It was engineered through sheer force of tweets with a lob from a militia of ride-or-die Twitter fans, who gobbled up the book wherever they could get it. We caught up with Shea for a phoner after his book tour and asked him how the hell he got here. </p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.2"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>GQ: So how do you even get on <em>The New York Times</em> best-seller list? It&#x2019;s all such a mystery. Is there like a number you&apos;ve gotta hit?</strong><br><strong>Shea Serrano:</strong> I don&apos;t understand it either. The only things I know are: you got to sell a lot of books, and you gotta make some noise. Those are the two guidelines my publisher told me. There&apos;s no set number you have to hit. There&apos;s just no way to know. You just do those two things and cross your fingers.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>When you become a best-selling <em>Times</em> author, do they give you anything tangible? Like a trophy or something?</strong>   <br>I don&apos;t think so. The is the first time it&apos;s happened for me. I dunno. That&apos;d be cool if they sent me something like a top hat that I can wear and then everybody will automatically know.</p><div class="embed twitter" data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-type="twitter"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SheaSerrano/status/657288677412868096">https://twitter.com/SheaSerrano/status/657288677412868096</a></p></blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>During your victory lap on Twitter you keep talking about how you sort of stumbled into this whole writing thing. How&#x2019;d you become a writer in the first place? What was your big break?</strong><br>The way I ended up getting started in writing is my wife was pregnant with twins. This was around 2008. And the plan was she was gonna stay home for six months after the kids were born. We needed to save up some money to do that. She was a teacher at the time, and I was a teacher at the time. </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.8">So we we&#x2019;re starting to save up all our money, and about four months in, she went into labor. It was this crazy thing. They rushed to the hospital, they had to do this surgery to keep the babies from coming out. It was a big ordeal, right. They told her you can&apos;t go back to work. You have to just lay down. You&apos;re on bed rest for the rest of the pregnancy.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.9">So I needed another job, you know? We had the money saved up for the six months after the babies came. But we were using it already during the pregnancy for bills. We were gonna run out. </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.a">I needed another job. I tried going to Target and Walmart, different restaurants to be a waiter. But nobody would hire me because I already had a full-time job. I was just literally at home Googling &quot;work from home jobs.&quot; Writer was one of them.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Clicking those &quot;make $80/hour working from home&quot; spam comments and all that.</strong><br>Yeah, stuff like that, you know! I saw &quot;writer&quot; was one of them. I said, well, I guess I&apos;m a writer now. I just started calling up local newspapers and telling them I was a writer. That&apos;s really all you have to do: You just gotta say you&apos;re a thing, and people will think you&apos;re that thing.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.c"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&quot;I tried going to Target and Walmart, different restaurants to be a waiter.

Not even fucking <em>Northwest Banner</em>. The <em><strong>Near</strong> Northwest Banner</em>. It was a neighborhood newspaper that this woman was printing up out of her garage, and then handing them out in the neighborhood. She had seen something I had written in a little blog thing that was on ESPN. There&apos;s this guy&#x2014;his name was Henry Abbott, and he was running this site called TrueHoop. He saw a thing I wrote, and he posted it on there. And I guess she went through that and she found me. So she asked me to write about sports for her.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.e">So I said all right. The first thing I ever did for her was a thing about the Astros. Craig Biggio was retiring at the time. That was the first thing I got paid to write. She paid me $15 for it.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.f">It was crazy, so I did that twice. She did the paper once a month. I did it twice and I was like, <em>Man, fuck this old lady. It&apos;s time to move on</em>. I used those two clips to try to get on at other places, you know? </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>I remember a few years ago I saw that <em>Rap Coloring Book</em> you did with Bun B percolating on Tumblr everywhere. How&#x2019;d you fall into that?</strong><br>I flipped the <em>Near Northwest Banner</em> job into a job at the <em>Houston Press</em>, which is the weekly paper here in Houston. So I was, like, trying to figure out my way around writing. I needed a way I could get consistent work. I noticed that the paper there was mostly all white dudes, and they were all writing about the local rock scene or whatever. And every once in awhile there was a rap thing, but not really; not too much was going on. I said, I&apos;m gonna make this my beat. And I just started going to every rap show that was in town. Not like when Kanye West was in town. Like the local little guy.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.h">So I was going to all these different shows, and when you go to enough shows eventually you run into Bun B. I ran into him once. And then again and again. I just became like, Oh, what&apos;s up? It was a &quot;he knew my name&quot; sort of situation. I did that for maybe two or three years, I think. Like I was that dude in Houston who covered the local rap scene.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.i">He hit me up one day because he wanted to do a book. He was like, I feel like I should do a book and I know you&apos;re covering rap, so let&apos;s work on something together. I originally thought he wanted like a UGK biography. But he wanted to do something fun, something silly. I didn&apos;t want to do anything serious.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.j">We were just pitching ideas back and forth and I hit him with the coloring book thing. He was all for it. It&apos;s hard to explain to a publisher, Hey, we&apos;re gonna do a coloring book about rappers! Who&apos;s gonna buy that shit? So I did the website. And I said I&apos;m gonna try to build a following, and then I can show the people. It went viral. In a little less than a week it took off.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.k">Abrams, my publisher, they saw it in the Approval Matrix in <em>New York Magazine</em>. They saw us there and then they hit us up, and we turned it into a book. That happened around 2012. I started it end of October and by beginning of November we were already out of there.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>So while all of this was going on, you were still teaching in the day? How&#x2019;d you pull that off? I get slumped after a few hours at the office.</strong><br>By then I had already been writing for a couple of years. Three or four years. I&apos;m super... organized with work stuff. I have a set schedule. Every day my schedule is exactly the same. </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.m"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&quot;I just started calling up local newspapers and telling them I was a writer.

Get there an hour early, do my school stuff. Teach during the day, do my coaching after school. Then I get home and I&apos;m with the kids from like 6:30 to 9. Then I&apos;m with the wife from 9 to 10:30. And then from 10:30 to 2 or 3 or whatever I&apos;m writing. I just had that schedule. If you have a set time, like I can only write during this set time? You can get a lot done because you&apos;re not gonna dick around.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.o">Once I had the schedule going it was not a problem. There were nights where you ended up staying up all night, that sorta thing. But that&apos;s just part of it. I gotta provide, fucking, 15 meals a day! I&apos;m responsible for 15 meals. [<em>Laughs</em>] You just do it.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>How&apos;d you get to <em>Grantland</em>?</strong><br>They reached out to me. I [was still at] the <em>Houston Press</em>, and I did a story there about Trey tha Truth. He was suing a local radio station&#x2014;they had banned him, and it was this whole big thing. But that was the first story I did that went national. After that, I used that momentum to flip it into a job with the <em>LA Weekly</em>, the sister paper to the Houston Press but still the biggest one in the chain. </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.q">So I was writing to them, and I was doing a weekly thing there. And I wrote this essay about having sex with my wife while listening to Drake. </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.r">That one spread around a whole bunch. A woman from <em>Grantland</em> named Molly Lambert saw it. She passed it to the editors, they liked it. After that I got a message from them that said: You wanna come try to pitch us?</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.s">At that point <em>Grantland</em> was already around for a couple of years. They had like Pulitzer Prize winners and <em>New York Times</em> people. I had never considered pitching them. I didn&apos;t have an in. I didn&apos;t know anybody over there. Molly made that shit happen. </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>What was your first story for <em>Grantland</em>?</strong> <br>The first one was about gift shopping with 2Chainz. It was just about trying to find a present for my wife, I think. I was real nervous, whatever. I was like: I&apos;m gonna pitch one idea every two weeks. And then I&apos;m trying to do one a week. You start working your way in there.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.u">I freelanced for them for like a year and a half. And then a guy there named Dan, who does all the contract stuff hit me up and said, Let&apos;s try to get you here only writing. We just want you to write for us. We don&apos;t want your name nowhere else. That kind of thing. </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>Was there an &#x201C;aw, shit&#x201D; moment that everything hit you?</strong><br>It&apos;s different via email because you don&apos;t have to look at anybody&apos;s face. They had a big meeting in L.A. and all the big basketball writers were out there and they asked me to come. It was the first time I had ever been to L.A. I go, and I&apos;m meeting everyone in the office for the first time. And there&apos;s this big boardroom type thing with a big table in there and everyone walks in and sits down. Bill Simmons walks in. Like, he&apos;s fucking Bill Simmons! And there&apos;s Zach Lowe. And it&apos;s Andrew Sharp. And Jason Concepcion. These guys I knew and had seen and who are the best basketball writers. And all of a sudden I&apos;m sitting at this table with them, supposed to pitch ideas behind these guys. And I&apos;m just like, What the fuck? What the fuck is happening right now?</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.w">It&apos;s like, how do you handle that, you know? I&apos;m still waiting for them to figure out that I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m doing. </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>You just got home to Houston, right? I&#x2019;m guessing you&#x2019;re not even thinking about your next book yet.</strong><br>I&apos;m gonna try to not do anything with a book for a couple of months. Because you know what ends up happening... when we did this book, when we started out I didn&apos;t feel any pressure at all. Because nobody was expecting the book to do anything. It was just, Oh, we&apos;ll sell a thousand copies the first week, and that will be a big success for us. That sort of situation.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.y">And then when it started to take off, it turned in from us being a joke saying &quot;We&apos;re gonna make the <em>New York Times</em>!&quot; to a real &quot;You guys might have a shot at this.&quot; </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.z">When that happened, all of a sudden there are pressures and expectations, you know? If I&apos;m doing all this jabber, I&apos;m running my mouth, and now if I don&apos;t make it, I don&apos;t wanna be that guy.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.10">I knew we were gonna be close when I saw how many books we were selling. I also knew that if we don&apos;t make it, the first week is your best chance to make it. There&apos;s not gonna be a big splash after that. I probably got at least another two to three years before I get another shot, and I don&apos;t want to have three years of me walking into a room and them saying like, &quot;He didn&apos;t make it.&quot; Nobody&apos;s gonna say that. Nobody cares. But in my head they&apos;re gonna be saying that when I walk in, and there was a lot of pressure there.</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.11">Now I know when we do this next book, now it&apos;s gonna be like, Yo, can you do it again? </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.12"><strong>&quot;Can you lead the league in scoring again? The team could could really use it.&quot;</strong><br>And it&apos;s fucking hard, man! Like people were just coming out of their mouths like it&apos;s not a thing, like, &quot;Oh! You&apos;re gonna make <em>The New York Times</em> best-seller list!&quot; You don&apos;t understand how impossible it is when 10,000 books come out every Tuesday and you gotta be in the top 15. Like do you understand how hard that is? They were just saying that like it was nothing. [<em>Laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.13">And I was just feeling more and more pressure. I don&apos;t wanna come home and tell my wife we didn&apos;t make it. She wouldn&apos;t care. But I would still have to say it. </p><div class="embed twitter" data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.14"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" data-type="twitter"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SheaSerrano/status/658416631874392064">https://twitter.com/SheaSerrano/status/658416631874392064</a></p></blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>Have you gotten anything crazy from your fans who are sending you pictures with the book?</strong><br>My favorite thing was we were in L.A., this guy showed up to the signing and he had a bag with him. I wasn&apos;t even paying any attention, but he grabbed the bag and set it on the table. And he took out a fucking jacket from 1980-something&#x2014;a Chalk Line sports jacket with David Robinson. </p><p data-reactid=".1nvmglb1l34.1.1.0.0.4.16">I&apos;m a big Spurs fan.
