  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHowever you feel about Mad Men splitting up Season 7, you must admit that last night was a perfect send-off: Matt Weiner gave us, literally, the moon. Peggy Olson took a small step for SC&amp;P, and a giant leap for womankind. Don Draper showed that he really is a changed man. Bert Cooper, played by double Tony winner Robert Morse, burst into song. Unfortunately, Ted Chaough (Kevin Rahm) had a rough time of it—but any episode where he puts on his aviator sunglasses can\u0027t be all bad, right? As we exit Season 7A, Ted is poised to return to New York City and get back in touch with his creative roots. Of course, many fans are hoping that he also gets back in touch with something else: his feelings for Peggy. But we\u0027ll have to wait until 2015 to find out if that\u0027s meant to be. Meanwhile, GQ spoke to Kevin Rahm about Ted\u0027s near-death experience, his feelings for Peggy, and his shiny shiny boots.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: I have to ask: Did you come to the set to watch Robert Morse do his last scene?\u000A\u000A Kevin Rahm: I didn\u0027t! I planned on it, but my wife works in Sacramento, so I go back and forth when I\u0027m not working. I know that Jay [Ferguson] came to set for it. If I\u0027d been in town, I definitely would have been there. I just watched that scene again just now. We watched it last night in Louisiana, where I\u0027m from, and my niece and nephew were asking all kinds of questions about what was going on. It was funny—during the amazing scene between Megan and Don, my nephew was like, \u0022I don\u0027t understand. Is she mad at him?\u0022 [Laughs] I said, \u0022It\u0027s a long story.\u0022 But Bobby Morse is so amazing.\u000A\u000AIt was very satisfying to finally see him sing and dance on Mad Men.\u000A\u000A So good! A soft shoe in socks, that has to be a first. And the look on Jon\u0027s face at the end—wow.\u000A\u000AAnd you tried to crash your plane.\u000A\u000A You know, just threatened it.\u000A\u000ADid you get any forewarning that Ted was in the throes of existential despair?\u000A\u000A You know, just pieces. A lot of it came out of other scenes. I think it was the first episode, when Pete walks into that diner in his plaid pants and Lacoste shirt, and he says, \u0022Ted Chaough, broken man.\u0022 And then Harry Crane says, \u0022Ted Chaough, useless.\u0022 And in this last episode, he was compared to Lane Pryce. So there were hints, but it all came from other people. And then he was always in his office alone. Well, it started that he was always there with Pete and the secretary, and then it was just Pete, and by the end he\u0027s just in a room by himself.\u000A\u000ASeems like a lot of your scenes this season consisted of you yelling into a telephone. \u000A\u000A Yeah. Which is fun because when they\u0027re shooting the other side, you get to come and just sit in the other office right outside the door. They don\u0027t shoot the scenes at the same time, but everyone\u0027s really good about being there for off-camera. My favorite was when they talk about Don pitching Burger Chef instead of Peggy, and I\u0027m on the phone but you don\u0027t know it until the very end. So I sat just off-camera, in my flip-flops, while they shot that whole scene.\u000A\u000AWere you nervous when you first read the plane scene?\u000A\u000A Well, it\u0027s the second scene in the episode, so I was like, \u0022Ummm...do I make it?\u0022 [Laughs] Someone asked me the other day if I peed myself when I read that, and I said, \u0022I pee myself when I read every script, until I\u0027m sure I\u0027m not dead!\u0022 Especially as we get towards the end, you know? Ginsberg cuts off a nipple and goes to the hospital, and Bert Cooper dies—so every script you read is like, \u0022Phew, I\u0027m still here.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat was the breaking point for Ted before he decided to cut the engines?\u000A\u000A He\u0027s just done with those guys. It\u0027s very similar to Ken Cosgrove dealing the guys from Chevy. It\u0027s just like, \u0022Look, these guys are douchebags and assholes, and this is not my job.\u0022 Ted wants to be creative and he doesn\u0027t want to deal with those people. That\u0027s Pete\u0027s job. And honestly, on those smaller planes, you can easily turn off the engine and start it back up. It\u0027s actually not a big deal. It\u0027s just, for someone who\u0027s not flying—personally, it would scare the crap out of me. But for a really good pilot, it\u0027s not actually a big deal. So it\u0027s just to put them in their place and to shut them up.\u000A\u000AIs it challenging to do a scene like that with your eyes hidden behind sunglasses?\u000A\u000A I loved that my eyes were hidden in that scene. There was a lot of eye rolling that you don\u0027t see, which would have given away more. Because you can\u0027t see my eyes, you don\u0027t know if he is trying to kill himself, and they\u0027re collateral damage, or if he\u0027s just messing with them.\u000A\u000AWas that the same plane set from last season?\u000A\u000A I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s the same plane. It\u0027s not a set, you know: They put up a green screen and they pull that little plane onto a stage, and they have guys pulling on the wings to make it bounce. And it\u0027s a small plane. When we shot the scene two seasons ago with Don and I in the plane—you know, I\u0027m not a huge guy, I\u0027m kind of a small guy, but Jon\u0027s pretty big. With the two of us, it was packed. And the guy next to me in this scene was bigger than Jon, and then they had a guy in the back—which, we thought, \u0022There\u0027s no way we\u0027re all gonna fit in that thing.\u0022 They turn on all the lights, and it gets hot, and then you have to yell as if it\u0027s really loud in there, and these guys are being deliberately douchey—so the frustration was not acting, I\u0027ll put it that way.\u000A\u000AI love that after the orange juice account nearly drove Ted to suicide, he was sitting in his office drinking—\u000A\u000A Yeah, he was drinking a screwdriver! [Laughs] And by the way, this is the guy who doesn\u0027t drink, really. He\u0027s not the big drinker, which we saw last year.\u000A\u000AAt the end, when Ted has decided to throw in the towel, Don appears to change his mind. Why does Don\u0027s speech work?\u000A\u000A I think it\u0027s three things. I think it\u0027s knowing Don, and Don\u0027s argument is good—\u0022You need to work. If it\u0027s not here, it\u0027s gonna be somewhere else. Trust me. Look what I went through to get back into it.\u0022 I think he also feels like he may owe Don a little, because California was Don\u0027s spot, you know? And he took it, and it\u0027s worked out horribly for both of them. So there may be some of that. And I also think that moving back to New York is a big draw.\u000A\u000AWhen Cutler says, \u0022Remember the last time you let [Don] talk you into something?\u0022—what specifically is he referring to?\u000A\u000A At first I thought he was talking about Chevy, but from my point of view, that turned out great for all of us. So then maybe, from Cutler\u0027s point of view, Don talked me into going to California. Because Cutler\u0027s not happy with Ted being in California, and part of it is that Cutler loses power without Ted there. Although there is an argument that he has more power with Ted gone, because he\u0027s always voting for Ted\u0027s proxy.\u000A\u000ADid you guys crack up after Harry Hamlin said \u0022It\u0027s a lot of money?\u0022\u000A\u000A Yes. Yes. There\u0027s a lot of cracking up on that set. Our table reads, you would think it was a sitcom. Pete\u0027s line, \u0022The clients want to live too, Ted!\u0022—that killed me.\u000A\u000AOne of the first scenes we saw this season was Peggy and Ted having an unexpected encounter in the office. Ted seemed a lot less shaken up by it than Peggy was. Why was that?\u000A\u000A That\u0027s a good question. Obviously a lot of the information comes from the scene they had last season in her office before he leaves, when he says, \u0022You\u0027re going to thank me one day that I made this decision,\u0022 and she says, \u0022Aren\u0027t you lucky you get to make decisions?\u0022 So I think part of it is, he\u0027s the one who got to make the decision and she never did. And all of a sudden he\u0027s back in her world again. She kinda got off easy because he went away, and all of a sudden he\u0027s back in her space. And I think he also just hides it better than her. He\u0027s clearly not happy about it, and how much that affected him while he was in California, we don\u0027t know.\u000A\u000ABefore we go, I have to ask you about Ted\u0027s shiny boots.\u000A\u000A How awesome are those things? Every time I put them on, I hear the theme music to when Captain Kirk fights.",

about <em>Mad Men</em> splitting up Season 7, you must admit that last night was a perfect send-off: Matt Weiner gave us, literally, the moon. Peggy Olson took a small step for SC&amp;P, and a giant leap for womankind. Don Draper showed that he really is a changed man. Bert Cooper, played by double Tony winner Robert Morse, burst into song. Unfortunately, Ted Chaough (Kevin Rahm) had a rough time of it&#x2014;but any episode where he puts on his aviator sunglasses can&#x2019;t be all bad, right? As we exit Season 7A, Ted is poised to return to New York City and get back in touch with his creative roots. Of course, many fans are hoping that he also gets back in touch with something else: his feelings for Peggy. But we&#x2019;ll have to wait until 2015 to find out if that&#x2019;s meant to be. Meanwhile, <em>GQ</em> spoke to Kevin Rahm about Ted&#x2019;s near-death experience, his feelings for Peggy, and his shiny shiny boots.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.2"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>GQ: I have to ask: Did you come to the set to watch Robert Morse do his last scene?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>Kevin Rahm:</strong> I didn&#x2019;t! I planned on it, but my wife works in Sacramento, so I go back and forth when I&#x2019;m not working. I know that Jay [Ferguson] came to set for it. If I&#x2019;d been in town, I definitely would have been there. I just watched that scene again just now. We watched it last night in Louisiana, where I&#x2019;m from, and my niece and nephew were asking all kinds of questions about what was going on. It was funny&#x2014;during the amazing scene between Megan and Don, my nephew was like, &quot;I don&#x2019;t understand. Is she mad at him?&quot; [Laughs] I said, &quot;It&#x2019;s a long story.&quot; But Bobby Morse is so amazing.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>It was very satisfying to finally see him sing and dance on <em>Mad Men</em>.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.7"> So good! A soft shoe in socks, that has to be a first. And the look on Jon&#x2019;s face at the end&#x2014;wow.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>And you tried to crash your plane.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.9"> You know, just threatened it.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Did you get any forewarning that Ted was in the throes of existential despair?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.b"> You know, just pieces. A lot of it came out of other scenes. I think it was the first episode, when Pete walks into that diner in his plaid pants and Lacoste shirt, and he says, &quot;Ted Chaough, broken man.&quot; And then Harry Crane says, &quot;Ted Chaough, useless.&quot; And in this last episode, he was compared to Lane Pryce. So there were hints, but it all came from other people. And then he was always in his office alone. Well, it started that he was always there with Pete and the secretary, and then it was just Pete, and by the end he&#x2019;s just in a room by himself.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Seems like a lot of your scenes this season consisted of you yelling into a telephone. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Yeah. Which is fun because when they&#x2019;re shooting the other side, you get to come and just sit in the other office right outside the door. They don&#x2019;t shoot the scenes at the same time, but everyone&#x2019;s really good about being there for off-camera. My favorite was when they talk about Don pitching Burger Chef instead of Peggy, and I&#x2019;m on the phone but you don&#x2019;t know it until the very end. So I sat just off-camera, in my flip-flops, while they shot that whole scene.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Were you nervous when you first read the plane scene?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.f"> Well, it&#x2019;s the second scene in the episode, so I was like, &quot;Ummm...do I make it?&quot; <em>[Laughs] </em>Someone asked me the other day if I peed myself when I read that, and I said, &quot;I pee myself when I read every script, until I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;m not dead!&quot; Especially as we get towards the end, you know? Ginsberg cuts off a nipple and goes to the hospital, and Bert Cooper dies&#x2014;so every script you read is like, &quot;Phew, I&#x2019;m still here.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>What was the breaking point for Ted before he decided to cut the engines?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.h"> He&#x2019;s just done with those guys. It&#x2019;s very similar to Ken Cosgrove dealing the guys from Chevy. It&#x2019;s just like, &quot;Look, these guys are douchebags and assholes, and this is not my job.&quot; Ted wants to be creative and he doesn&#x2019;t want to deal with those people. That&#x2019;s Pete&#x2019;s job. And honestly, on those smaller planes, you can easily turn off the engine and start it back up. It&#x2019;s actually not a big deal. It&#x2019;s just, for someone who&#x2019;s not flying&#x2014;personally, it would scare the crap out of me. But for a really good pilot, it&#x2019;s not actually a big deal. So it&#x2019;s just to put them in their place and to shut them up.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Is it challenging to do a scene like that with your eyes hidden behind sunglasses?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.j"> I <em>loved</em> that my eyes were hidden in that scene. There was a lot of eye rolling that you don&#x2019;t see, which would have given away more. Because you can&#x2019;t see my eyes, you don&#x2019;t know if he <em>is </em>trying to kill himself, and they&#x2019;re collateral damage, or if he&#x2019;s just messing with them.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Was that the same plane set from last season?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.l"> I&#x2019;m pretty sure it&#x2019;s the same plane. It&#x2019;s not a set, you know: They put up a green screen and they pull that little plane onto a stage, and they have guys pulling on the wings to make it bounce. And it&#x2019;s a <em>small</em> plane. When we shot the scene two seasons ago with Don and I in the plane&#x2014;you know, I&#x2019;m not a huge guy, I&#x2019;m kind of a small guy, but Jon&#x2019;s pretty big. With the two of us, it was <em>packed</em>. And the guy next to me in this scene was bigger than Jon, and then they had a guy in the back&#x2014;which, we thought, &quot;There&#x2019;s no way we&#x2019;re all gonna fit in that thing.&quot; They turn on all the lights, and it gets hot, and then you have to yell as if it&#x2019;s really loud in there, and these guys are being deliberately douchey&#x2014;so the frustration was not acting, I&#x2019;ll put it that way.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>I love that after the orange juice account nearly drove Ted to suicide, he was sitting in his office drinking&#x2014;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.n"> Yeah, he was drinking a screwdriver! <em>[Laughs] </em>And by the way, this is the guy who doesn&#x2019;t drink, really. He&#x2019;s not the big drinker, which we saw last year.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>At the end, when Ted has decided to throw in the towel, Don appears to change his mind. Why does Don&#x2019;s speech work?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.p"> I think it&#x2019;s three things. I think it&#x2019;s knowing Don, and Don&#x2019;s argument is good&#x2014;&quot;You need to work. If it&#x2019;s not here, it&#x2019;s gonna be somewhere else. Trust me. Look what I went through to get back into it.&quot; I think he also feels like he may owe Don a little, because California was Don&#x2019;s spot, you know? And he took it, and it&#x2019;s worked out horribly for both of them. So there may be some of that. And I also think that moving back to New York is a big draw.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>When Cutler says, &quot;Remember the last time you let [Don] talk you into something?&quot;&#x2014;what specifically is he referring to?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.r"> At first I thought he was talking about Chevy, but from my point of view, that turned out great for all of us. So then maybe, from Cutler&#x2019;s point of view, Don talked me into going to California. Because Cutler&#x2019;s not happy with Ted being in California, and part of it is that Cutler loses power without Ted there. Although there is an argument that he has more power with Ted gone, because he&#x2019;s always voting for Ted&#x2019;s proxy.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>Did you guys crack up after Harry Hamlin said &quot;It&#x2019;s a lot of money?&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.t"> Yes. Yes. There&#x2019;s a <em>lot</em> of cracking up on that set. Our table reads, you would think it was a sitcom. Pete&#x2019;s line, &quot;The clients want to live too, Ted!&quot;&#x2014;that killed me.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong>One of the first scenes we saw this season was Peggy and Ted having an unexpected encounter in the office. Ted seemed a lot less shaken up by it than Peggy was. Why was that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.v"> That&#x2019;s a good question. Obviously a lot of the information comes from the scene they had last season in her office before he leaves, when he says, &quot;You&#x2019;re going to thank me one day that I made this decision,&quot; and she says, &quot;Aren&#x2019;t you lucky you get to make decisions?&quot; So I think part of it is, he&#x2019;s the one who got to make the decision and she never did. And all of a sudden he&#x2019;s back in her world again. She kinda got off easy because he went away, and all of a sudden he&#x2019;s back in her space. And I think he also just hides it better than her. He&#x2019;s clearly not happy about it, and how much that affected him while he was in California, we don&#x2019;t know.</p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong>Before we go, I have to ask you about Ted&#x2019;s shiny boots.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1mr8ntxjzls.1.1.0.0.4.x"> How awesome are those things? Every time I put them on, I hear the theme music to when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9RC6NKPsqQ&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLE283283B0DF1828E">Captain Kirk fights</a>.</p></div><div
