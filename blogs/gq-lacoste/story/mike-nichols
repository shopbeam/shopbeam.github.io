  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMike Nichols, who died on Wednesday at age 83, was an expert at new normals. Shipped to the States as a child refugee from Hitler, he discovered improv with the precursor to Chicago\u0027s Second City troupe in the \u002750s before launching the partnership with fellow smartass Elaine May that turned the duo\u0027s An Evening With Nichols And Elaine May into Broadway\u0027s hottest ticket the year JFK won the White House. Even doughty literary critic Edmund Wilson, who\u0027d been around since the Jazz Age, was a fan. While Nichols and May\u0027s sendups of over-articulate, helplessly fatuous modern neurotics weren\u0027t unprecedented—Village Voice cartoonist Jules Feiffer had gotten there first—the duo\u0027s success helped define the way the \u002760s brought what used to be the egghead fringe\u0027s in-jokes and attitudes into the mainstream.\u000A\u000AMay was probably the real comic genius of the two. Yet Nichols played the vital role of her enabler, able to not only appreciate her talent but keep up with, showcase, and rationalize it. Since being a performer interested him less than being the one contextualizing the performance, it was natural for him to turn director once the act broke up, first in theater—he was Neil Simon\u0027s go-to guy when Simon was making his bones as suburbia\u0027s favorite playwright—and then in film.\u000A\u000AIf his first movie, 1966\u0027s Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, was one kind of generational landmark—movieland\u0027s ultimate farewell to the curdled \u002750s, in a way, featuring the then-iconic Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in the only collaboration of their careers that transcended cartoonishness—his second, The Graduate, was its youth-revolt flip side, from Simon &amp; Garfunkel on the soundtrack to Dustin Hoffman\u0027s emergence as a new breed of movie star. While most people were still trying to get a handle on the generation gap, Nichols and his ultra-clever scenarist Buck Henry had not only pegged the counterculture\u0027s essentially middle-class petri dish—S &amp; G weren\u0027t exactly the Doors, people—but, in the fadeout on Hoffman\u0027s and Katharine Ross\u0027s \u0022What now?\u0022 blank faces, predicted its futility.\u000A\u000AThen, in 1970, amid bonanzas of publicity, Nichols unveiled his Big One: the screen adaptation of Catch-22, which Orson Welles, among others, had been itching to do for years. (Welles ended up acting in it.) But the movie was Nichols\u0027s first dud, simultaneously marring his reputations as an ace wit, a major director, and a man with the Midas touch even as it exposed the tensions between those roles. If you\u0027re going to compete with Buñuel and Fellini, which he self-consciously was, you\u0027re probably better off not doing it on The Longest Day\u0027s budget, and 1970 just wasn\u0027t a good year for Big Ones: Arthur Penn\u0027s Little Big Man came a similar cropper. Once audiences flocked to Robert Altman\u0027s funkier, hipper MASH instead, Nichols\u0027s standing as ye olde Zeitgeist\u0027s shrewdest trend maven never recovered.\u000A\u000ATo his credit, he never seemed bitter about the demotion, assuming he even thought his latest new normal qualified as one. Quite possibly relieved that he was no longer the object of overwrought expectations, since being the apple of everyone\u0027s eye is never the comfiest slot for a born observer, he just went on with his career. After recouping considerably with Carnal Knowledge__—from a Jules Feiffer script, and The Graduate\u0027s real sequel and prequel combined—he settled into steady work right on the cusp of value and inconsequentiality, maybe not bad terrain for someone with his basic mistrust of artistic passion.\u000A\u000ACommitment to his material was never Nichols\u0027s strong point, and the material often didn\u0027t deserve it anyway. Still, his emotional reticence is only a fatal flaw if you think unadorned self-expression is the point of the gig, and he plainly didn\u0027t. Refugees are wary people.\u000A\u000AExcept when he had the likes of Virginia Woolf\u0027s Haskell Wexler on hand to supply a project\u0027s photographic style, his cinematic sense was never very distinctive. Ultimately, he was a filmed-theater guy, not much on visual kineticism in an era when, from Steven Spielberg\u0027s advent on, that was increasingly the ball game. But he never lost his knack for intelligent surprise as an enabler of actors and, especially, actresses, from Cher in 1983\u0027s Silkwood all the way to Natalie Portman in Closer over 20 years later. Maybe Steven Soderbergh gets the credit for winning Julia Roberts her damned Erin Brockovich Oscar, but Nichols was the one who weaned her for good off relying on Colgate as a substitute for talent, in both Closer and his final movie, Charlie Wilson\u0027s War__—which also featured a terrific performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not really Nichols\u0027s fault that, with one exception, he never seemed like the ideal director for much of anything after The Graduate. But that one exception is monumental. Combining filmed theater, his skill with actors, and ye olde Zeitgeist\u0027s unexpectedly resurrected pots of gold, his 2003 HBO adaptation of Tony Kushner\u0027s Angels in America was every bit as epochal an undertaking, in its way, as Catch-22__—and this time, he delivered, making you wonder whether, had he been born a generation or two later, cable TV might have been his logical home. But since he\u0027d started learning how to get along without those in 1939, Broadway and Hollywood had to do in a pinch.",

Shipped to the States as a child refugee from Hitler, he discovered improv with the precursor to Chicago&apos;s Second City troupe in the &apos;50s before launching the partnership with fellow smartass Elaine May that turned the duo&apos;s <em>An Evening With Nichols And Elaine May </em>into Broadway&apos;s hottest ticket the year JFK won the White House. Even doughty literary critic Edmund Wilson, who&apos;d been around since the Jazz Age, was a fan. While Nichols and May&apos;s sendups of over-articulate, helplessly fatuous modern neurotics weren&apos;t unprecedented&#x2014;<em>Village Voice </em>cartoonist Jules Feiffer had gotten there first&#x2014;the duo&apos;s success helped define the way the &apos;60s brought what used to be the egghead fringe&apos;s in-jokes and attitudes into the mainstream.</p><p data-reactid=".1e8l1ye75z4.1.1.0.0.4.2">May was probably the real comic genius of the two. Yet Nichols played the vital role of her enabler, able to not only appreciate her talent but keep up with, showcase, and rationalize it. Since being a performer interested him less than being the one contextualizing the performance, it was natural for him to turn director once the act broke up, first in theater&#x2014;he was Neil Simon&apos;s go-to guy when Simon was making his bones as suburbia&apos;s favorite playwright&#x2014;and then in film.</p><p data-reactid=".1e8l1ye75z4.1.1.0.0.4.3">If his first movie, 1966&apos;s <em>Who<strong>&apos;</strong>s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, </em>was one kind of generational landmark&#x2014;movieland&apos;s ultimate farewell to the curdled &apos;50s, in a way, featuring the then-iconic Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in the only collaboration of their careers that transcended cartoonishness&#x2014;his second, <em>The Graduate, </em>was its youth-revolt flip side, from Simon &amp; Garfunkel on the soundtrack to Dustin Hoffman&apos;s emergence as a new breed of movie star. While most people were still trying to get a handle on the generation gap, Nichols and his ultra-clever scenarist Buck Henry had not only pegged the counterculture&apos;s essentially middle-class petri dish&#x2014;S &amp; G weren&apos;t exactly the Doors, people&#x2014;but, in the fadeout on Hoffman&apos;s and Katharine Ross&apos;s &quot;What now?&quot; blank faces, predicted its futility.</p><p data-reactid=".1e8l1ye75z4.1.1.0.0.4.5">Then, in 1970, amid bonanzas of publicity, Nichols unveiled his Big One: the screen adaptation of <em>Catch-22, </em>which Orson Welles, among others, had been itching to do for years. (Welles ended up acting in it.) But the movie was Nichols&apos;s first dud, simultaneously marring his reputations as an ace wit, a major director, and a man with the Midas touch even as it exposed the tensions between those roles. If you&apos;re going to compete with Bu&#xF1;uel and Fellini, which he self-consciously was, you&apos;re probably better off not doing it on <em>The Longest Day<strong>&apos;</strong>s </em>budget, and 1970 just wasn&apos;t a good year for Big Ones: Arthur Penn&apos;s <em>Little Big Man </em>came a similar cropper. Once audiences flocked to Robert Altman&apos;s funkier, hipper <em>MASH </em>instead, Nichols&apos;s standing as ye olde Zeitgeist&apos;s shrewdest trend maven never recovered.</p><p data-reactid=".1e8l1ye75z4.1.1.0.0.4.6">To his credit, he never seemed bitter about the demotion, assuming he even thought his latest new normal qualified as one. Quite possibly relieved that he was no longer the object of overwrought expectations, since being the apple of everyone&apos;s eye is never the comfiest slot for a born observer, he just went on with his career. After recouping considerably with <em>Carnal Knowledge__&#x2014;</em>from a Jules Feiffer script, and <em>The Graduate</em>&apos;s real sequel and prequel combined&#x2014;he settled into steady work right on the cusp of value and inconsequentiality, maybe not bad terrain for someone with his basic mistrust of artistic passion.</p><p data-reactid=".1e8l1ye75z4.1.1.0.0.4.7">Commitment to his material was never Nichols&apos;s strong point, and the material often didn&apos;t deserve it anyway. Still, his emotional reticence is only a fatal flaw if you think unadorned self-expression is the point of the gig, and he plainly didn&apos;t. Refugees are wary people.</p><p data-reactid=".1e8l1ye75z4.1.1.0.0.4.8">Except when he had the likes of <em>Virginia Woolf<strong>&apos;</strong>s </em>Haskell Wexler on hand to supply a project&apos;s photographic style, his cinematic sense was never very distinctive. Ultimately, he was a filmed-theater guy, not much on visual kineticism in an era when, from Steven Spielberg&apos;s advent on, that was increasingly the ball game. But he never lost his knack for intelligent surprise as an enabler of actors and, especially, actresses, from Cher in 1983&apos;s <em>Silkwood</em> all the way to Natalie Portman in <em>Closer </em>over 20 years later. Maybe Steven Soderbergh gets the credit for winning Julia Roberts her damned <em>Erin Brockovich </em>Oscar, but Nichols was the one who weaned her for good off relying on Colgate as a substitute for talent, in both <em>Closer </em>and his final movie, <em>Charlie Wilson<strong>&apos;</strong>s War__&#x2014;</em>which also featured a terrific performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman.</p><p data-reactid=".1e8l1ye75z4.1.1.0.0.4.9">It&apos;s not really Nichols&apos;s fault that, with one exception, he never seemed like the <em>ideal </em>director for much of anything after <em>The Graduate. </em>But that one exception is monumental. Combining filmed theater, his skill with actors, and ye olde Zeitgeist&apos;s unexpectedly resurrected pots of gold, his 2003 HBO adaptation of Tony Kushner&apos;s <em>Angels in America </em>was every bit as epochal an undertaking, in its way, as <em>Catch-22__&#x2014;</em>and this time, he delivered, making you wonder whether, had he been born a generation or two later, cable TV might have been his logical home. But since he&apos;d started learning how to get along without those in 1939, Broadway and Hollywood had to do in a pinch.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1e8l1ye75z4.1.1.0.0.5"><div
