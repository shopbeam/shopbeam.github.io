  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABV: Is it the GQ Curse? In September 2012 we put Mark Sanchez on our cover (oops!), and this September it was RG3 and Colin Kaepernick. Things aren\u0027t nearly as dire for those two—they\u0027re both healthy starters, and face off tonight in Washington—but it\u0027s fair to say they\u0027ve had downer seasons, especially RG3. As the resident Redskins obsessive and author of our RG3 story, I\u0027ll get into his failings (and upsides) in the course of this conversation. But let\u0027s start with you and Kaepernick, who, in your profile, went out of his way to emphasize his prep, his film study, all the mental things that make him the player he is. This season, it sure seems like opposing defenses have studied up on him. His completion percentage is 56.2—that\u0027s 31st in the league—and he already four more interceptions (7) than he had all of last season. What gives?\u000A\u000AAC: Well, let me start by saying that Trent Dilfer\u0027s recent proclamation—that Kaepernick is a \u0022remedial passer after his first read is taken away\u0022—was a trademark combo of asinine and pat. Kaepernick bears some of the blame with what\u0027s going on (or, rather, isn\u0027t) with the Niners\u0027 offense. But very little of what\u0027s going has to do with his ability to read. He could read like Peyton Manning, and that offense would still be stymied. Fact is, his receivers are getting no separation. Combined with a few other things, it\u0027s been killer, just killer.\u000A\u000ABV: Trent Dilfer still smarts for being widely and correctly considered one of the most remedial QB\u0027s to ever win a Super Bowl. So take that with a large grain of sea salt. Still, his comment touches on something that has dogged Griffin this year, too—the idea that he and Kaepernick are both first-read QB\u0027s who panic if their preferred option on any given play is covered. I certainly agree that Griffin needs to get better at running through his options, but the Skins have the same problem—a very mediocre receiving corps. The bigger issue, though, is the insane lack of patience that NFL media—and fans—have with developing players.\u000A\u000AAC: I often wonder just what that overused term, \u0022Sophomore Slump,\u0022 really means. Isn\u0027t it just a vague, catch-all synonym for \u0022playing poorly\u0022? If it means anything, if there\u0027s a there there to it, it just might be that \u0022Sophomore Slump\u0022 isn\u0027t a phenomenon that begins on the field, but is rather a media-generated term that takes on self-fulfilling qualities once it gets into players\u0027 heads.\u000A\u000AIt does seem to me, with Griffin and especially Kaepernick, that if a wizard waved a wand, magically allowing us to see and read cartoon balloons emanating from their heads during games, we wouldn\u0027t see a calm, lowercase progression of \u0022...read one, not open...read two, covered...read three...\u0022 but instead an all-capitalized mental scream: \u0022DON\u0027T MESS UP! OH GOD DON\u0027T MESS IT UP! AGHHHHHHH!\u0022\u000A\u000ABV: I agree with all that, though I\u0027d add that defensive coaches in the NFL are some of the smartest and most competitive workaholic madmen on earth. And they studied the hell out of these two. So of course that\u0027s going to have an impact. The league is just better at defending them this season than last.\u000A\u000AYour magic-wand scenario is fascinating. We\u0027re constantly force-fed the sports-cliché that when these \u0022elite athletes\u0022 are on the field, they\u0027re able to block everything out, just play, never think about the previous play, only the next etc etc etc. But c\u0027mon. They\u0027re human beings. They\u0027re kids! And of course they have the capacity to psych themselves out and succumb to the pressure. My friend and GQ contributor Mike Silver of NFL.com  reported this week that Griffin is \u0022insecure\u0022 and worried about his backup Kirk Cousins, who played well last year when he had the chance. Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan vigorously disputed the report, but who knows.\u000A\u000AAnyway, when you interviewed Kap for your story, was there anything about him that struck you as a guy who would let the pressure and expectations get to him in game situations?\u000A\u000AAC: I think Kaepernick is a very sensitive individual—and I do not mean that in a sarcastic or snarky way. When I call him \u0022sensitive,\u0022 I\u0027m referring mostly to his empathetic capacity; his life abounds with stories of gratuitously offered kindness. To a lesser extent, I\u0027m referring to his awareness of how others perceive him. I do think he listens to, and cares about...stuff that gets said about him. Which may explain why Jim Harbaugh recently advised Kap to cut back on his social media activities.\u000A\u000AThat said, I don\u0027t think the guy\u0027s personal sensitivity is the issue. At most, it\u0027s an effect, not a cause. The cause, in my opinion: Colin Kaepernick is not only being poorly coached, but actively mis-coached. He\u0027s a read-option god on an offense that has decided—inexplicably, idiotically—not to play read option. The joyful bazooka-armed, antelope-legged Kaepernick of yore has been turned into...Alex Smith II, a joyless, nervous player who dares not: dares not break the pocket. Dares not improvise. Dares not throw to where the receiver is going to be rather than waiting for separation. Dares not stop thinking for one second, \u0022I am the Franchise! Must not make a mistake! Cannot let the freak flag fly!\u0022\u000A\u000ALong and short: Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Greg Roman are trying to fit a transcendent talent into a square-shaped Roger Staubach mold.\u000A\u000ADo you think anything similar is happening with RG3?\u000A\u000ABV: This issue—to read-option or not to read-option—is becoming the dilemma for many NFL teams of the present and probably of the future. Nowhere is it more of an issue than in Washington. Griffin and his father made so much noise in the off-season about wanting him to be a \u0022pass-first\u0022 QB that the Shanahans, who very much wanted to run the read-option, acquiesced. We all saw how that went over the first few games. Griffin was incredibly rusty, way rustier than anyone expected, and the more conventional offense they were trying to run didn\u0027t work at all. (They piled up yards in the second half of games, but only because they were so far behind and the defenses loosened up.) So they start 0-3... and then, hey, look what\u0027s back! The read-option. Partly that was Griffin getting healthier and more able to run that kind of offense, but a lot of it was Griffin recognizing that the team\u0027s success last year was a direct result of him being able to terrorize defenses with the threat of the run. Look, Griffin\u0027s a gamer. You can question a lot of things about him, and in the past week plenty of people in Washington have, but his desire, his fire, is not one of them.\u000A\u000ASo what I think is happening with him is that the Shanahans are running the right offense, more or less, which is an inherently dangerous offense with respect to his long-term health. Griffin knows this, and sometimes he\u0027s thinking about it, which makes him tentative, and sometimes he\u0027s not, which makes him explosive. But he simply isn\u0027t a good enough pocket passer, at least not yet, to run a traditional \u0022pro-style\u0022 offense. (How much longer will that term mean what it has always meant? Ask Cam Newton.) On some level I think he knows this too, even though he\u0027d never admit it. I don\u0027t envy Griffin, and I don\u0027t envy the Shanahans. I do envy Dan Snyder, because no matter what happens, that guy is still gonna be rich.\u000A\u000AAC: Envy Dan Snyder? That\u0027s a bit like envying Mr. Charles \u0022Monty\u0022 Burns, no?\u000A\u000AIn the end, I think you and I have very similar diagnoses for Griffin and Kaepernick. There are concrete, measurable factors contributing to their collapses: hobbled receiver corps, no healthy long-ball receivers to stretch the field and multiply their options. But in both cases much of the problem involves a crisis of confidence brought on by bad coaching. (I was tempted to say \u0022criminally negligent,\u0022 but that term should be applied only in the most egregious situations—like, say, the decision not to pull RG3 and his teetering knee from last year\u0027s playoff game against the Seahawks.) Yes, as you point out, defensive coordinators have spent the off-season studying up on the likes of RG3 and Kap, and have thrown a host of complex schemes at them. In response, the Niners have tried to turn Kap into a pocket-only genius like Peyton Manning—and given the young man too damn much to think about. Kap is a football wonk, as studious and dedicated to film as any of them. But at least at this point, his talent is fueled by an intuitive, rather than a cognitive, genius. In no small part, the run-and-gun suits him because it limits what he has to think about it. It puts a much-needed cap on the Kap. More important, it makes him unpredictable, limiting and even obviating the complicated schemes those defensive coordinators cooked up in the off-season.\u000A\u000AIn short, Norman and Harbaugh—after going with the \u0022hot hand\u0022 after Alex Smith concussed, and in effect saying, \u0022We trust you\u0022—have put Kaepernick in an offensive scheme whose underlying message is: We don\u0027t trust you.\u000A\u000AThat said, there may be another, more ominous, reason Kaepernick is circling the drain this season. Would you like to know what that is, Brendan?      \u000A\u000ABV: Of course.\u000A\u000AAC: A cab driver in Indianapolis, a recent arrival from Morocco, let me in on this secret. After holding forth knowledgeably and eloquently on Peyton Manning and what he has meant, materially and symbolically, to the city of Indianapolis, he changed the subject.\u000A\u000A\u0022You speak of Aaron Hernandez...\u0022 he began. I hadn\u0027t, but let him continue. \u0022And yet I tell you, my friend, before this football season is ended, there will be...another murderer in the NFL. Would you like to know who this will be?\u0022\u000A\u000AYes, I said. I would.\u000A\u000A\u0022Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers! Would you like to know why?\u0022\u000A\u000AYes, I said. I would.\u000A\u000A\u0022Three reasons,\u0022 my cabbie said. \u0022The first is the color of his skin. The tone is identical to that of Aaron Hernandez. They could be brothers! The second is the tattoos. Colin Kaepernick himself may not be aware of this, but inside the tattoos that cover his body are many signs and symbols that speak of the Devil and his intentions! Finally, and most important, Colin Kaepernick lives and plays in San Francisco—a city of most unholy temptations. In San Francisco, a man can walk naked through the streets holding hands with another naked man! Most unholy. If Colin Kaepernick were to be traded to Indianapolis, he could marry an Indiana farm girl, raised on eating corn, with good values! But that is not to happen. So, my friend, I tell you again, before this season has ended, Colin Kaepernick will become...a murderer!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022That is an extraordinary prediction,\u0022 I offered.\u000A\u000A\u0022Nobody knows who his father is,\u0022 my cabbie said. And left it at that. For a while, he eyed me in his rearview mirror.\u000A\u000A\u0022Are you implying...\u0022 I began.\u000A\u000A\u0022Nobody knows!\u0022 he said. \u0022That is all I am saying.\u0022\u000A\u000AI was left to draw my own conclusions from this. And so should you, Brendan. So should you. That\u0027s all I\u0027m saying. I mean, it\u0027s got to be hard for a guy to read through his second, third and fourth options in less than three seconds when he\u0027s got murder on the mind, you know?\u000A\u000AMOST. UNHOLY. TEMPTATIONS.\u000A\u000AThat said, what are you predictions for tonight\u0027s game, Brendan? \u000A\u000ABV: I\u0027m afraid one team is going to get murdered tonight. And Robert Griffin III, a religious man, is unfortunately no murderer.\u000A\u000AAC: Agreed. Niners by 12.",

data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.1"><strong>BV:</strong> Is it the GQ Curse? In September 2012 we put Mark Sanchez on our cover (oops!), and this September it was RG3 and Colin Kaepernick. Things aren&#x2019;t nearly as dire for those two&#x2014;they&#x2019;re both healthy starters, and face off tonight in Washington&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s fair to say they&#x2019;ve had downer seasons, especially RG3. As the resident Redskins obsessive and author of <a href="../entertainment/sports/201309/robert-griffin-iii-rg3-cover-september-2013">our RG3 story</a>, I&#x2019;ll get into his failings (and upsides) in the course of this conversation. But let&#x2019;s start with you and Kaepernick, who, in <a href="../entertainment/sports/201309/colin-kaepernick-cover-september-2013">your profile</a>, went out of his way to emphasize his prep, his film study, all the mental things that make him the player he is. This season, it sure seems like opposing defenses have studied up on <em>him</em>. His completion percentage is 56.2&#x2014;that&#x2019;s 31st in the league&#x2014;and he already four more interceptions (7) than he had all of last season. What gives?</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>AC:</strong> Well, let me start by saying that Trent Dilfer&#x2019;s recent proclamation&#x2014;that Kaepernick is a &quot;remedial passer after his first read is taken away&quot;&#x2014;was a trademark combo of asinine and pat. Kaepernick bears some of the blame with what&#x2019;s going on (or, rather, isn&#x2019;t) with the Niners&#x2019; offense. But very little of what&#x2019;s going has to do with his ability to read. He could read like Peyton Manning, and that offense would still be stymied. Fact is, his receivers are getting <em>no</em> separation. Combined with a few other things, it&#x2019;s been killer, just killer.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>BV:</strong> Trent Dilfer still smarts for being widely and correctly considered one of the most remedial QB&#x2019;s to ever win a Super Bowl. So take that with a large grain of sea salt. Still, his comment touches on something that has dogged Griffin this year, too&#x2014;the idea that he and Kaepernick are both first-read QB&#x2019;s who panic if their preferred option on any given play is covered. I certainly agree that Griffin needs to get better at running through his options, but the Skins have the same problem&#x2014;a very mediocre receiving corps. The bigger issue, though, is the insane lack of patience that NFL media&#x2014;and fans&#x2014;have with developing players.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>AC:</strong> I often wonder just what that overused term, &quot;Sophomore Slump,&quot; really means. Isn&#x2019;t it just a vague, catch-all synonym for &quot;playing poorly&quot;? If it means anything, if there&#x2019;s a <em>there</em> there to it, it just might be that &quot;Sophomore Slump&quot; isn&#x2019;t a phenomenon that begins on the field, but is rather a media-generated term that takes on self-fulfilling qualities once it gets into players&#x2019; heads.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.6">It <em>does</em> seem to me, with Griffin and especially Kaepernick, that if a wizard waved a wand, magically allowing us to see and read cartoon balloons emanating from their heads during games, we wouldn&#x2019;t see a calm, lowercase progression of &quot;...<em>read one, not open...read two, covered...read three...&quot; </em>but instead an all-capitalized mental scream: &quot;<em>DON&#x2019;T MESS UP! OH GOD DON&#x2019;T MESS IT UP! AGHHHHHHH!&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>BV:</strong> I agree with all that, though I&#x2019;d add that defensive coaches in the NFL are some of the smartest and most competitive workaholic madmen on earth. And they studied the hell out of these two. So of course that&#x2019;s going to have an impact. The league is just better at defending them this season than last.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.8">Your magic-wand scenario is fascinating. We&#x2019;re constantly force-fed the sports-clich&#xE9; that when these &quot;elite athletes&quot; are on the field, they&#x2019;re able to block everything out, just play, never think about the previous play, only the next etc etc etc. But c&#x2019;mon. They&#x2019;re human beings. They&#x2019;re kids! And of course they have the capacity to psych themselves out and succumb to the pressure. My friend and GQ contributor Mike Silver of <a href="http://nfl.com/">NFL.com</a> <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000286339/article/rgiii-asked-redskins-not-to-show-his-bad-plays"> reported this week</a> that Griffin is &quot;insecure&quot; and worried about his backup Kirk Cousins, who played well last year when he had the chance. Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan vigorously disputed the report, but who knows.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.9">Anyway, when you interviewed Kap for your story, was there anything about him that struck you as a guy who would let the pressure and expectations get to him in game situations?</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>AC:</strong> I think Kaepernick is a very sensitive individual&#x2014;and I do <em>not</em> mean that in a sarcastic or snarky way. When I call him &quot;sensitive,&quot; I&#x2019;m referring mostly to his empathetic capacity; his life abounds with stories of gratuitously offered kindness. To a lesser extent, I&#x2019;m referring to his awareness of how others perceive him. I <em>do </em>think he listens to, and cares about...stuff that gets said about him. Which may explain why Jim Harbaugh recently advised Kap to cut back on his social media activities.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.b">That said, I don&#x2019;t think the guy&#x2019;s personal sensitivity is the issue. At most, it&#x2019;s an effect, not a cause. The cause, in my opinion: Colin Kaepernick is not only being poorly coached, but actively <em>mis-</em>coached. He&#x2019;s a read-option god on an offense that has decided&#x2014;inexplicably, idiotically&#x2014;<em>not to play read option. </em>The joyful bazooka-armed, antelope-legged Kaepernick of yore has been turned into...Alex Smith II, a joyless, nervous player who dares not: dares not break the pocket. Dares not improvise. Dares not throw to where the receiver is going to be rather than waiting for separation. Dares not stop thinking for one second, &quot;<em>I am the Franchise! Must not make a mistake! Cannot let the freak flag fly!&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.c">Long and short: Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Greg Roman are trying to fit a transcendent talent into a square-shaped Roger Staubach mold.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.d">Do you think anything similar is happening with RG3?</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>BV:</strong> This issue&#x2014;to read-option or not to read-option&#x2014;is becoming <em>the</em> dilemma for many NFL teams of the present and probably of the future. Nowhere is it more of an issue than in Washington. Griffin and his father made so much noise in the off-season about wanting him to be a &quot;pass-first&quot; QB that the Shanahans, who very much wanted to run the read-option, acquiesced. We all saw how <em>that</em> went over the first few games. Griffin was incredibly rusty, way rustier than anyone expected, and the more conventional offense they were trying to run didn&#x2019;t work at all. (They piled up yards in the second half of games, but only because they were so far behind and the defenses loosened up.) So they start 0-3... and then, hey, look what&#x2019;s back! The read-option. Partly that was Griffin getting healthier and more able to run that kind of offense, but a lot of it was Griffin recognizing that the team&#x2019;s success last year was a direct result of him being able to terrorize defenses with the threat of the run. Look, Griffin&#x2019;s a gamer. You can question a lot of things about him, and in the past week plenty of people in Washington have, but his desire, his fire, is not one of them.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.f">So what I think is happening with him is that the Shanahans are running the right offense, more or less, which is an inherently dangerous offense with respect to his long-term health. Griffin knows this, and sometimes he&#x2019;s thinking about it, which makes him tentative, and sometimes he&#x2019;s not, which makes him explosive. But he simply isn&#x2019;t a good enough pocket passer, at least not yet, to run a traditional &quot;pro-style&quot; offense. (How much longer will that term mean what it has always meant? Ask Cam Newton.) On some level I think he knows this too, even though he&#x2019;d never admit it. I don&#x2019;t envy Griffin, and I don&#x2019;t envy the Shanahans. I do envy Dan Snyder, because no matter what happens, that guy is still gonna be rich.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>AC:</strong> Envy Dan Snyder? That&#x2019;s a bit like envying Mr. Charles &quot;Monty&quot; Burns, no?</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.h">In the end, I think you and I have very similar diagnoses for Griffin and Kaepernick. There are concrete, measurable factors contributing to their collapses: hobbled receiver corps, no healthy long-ball receivers to stretch the field and multiply their options. But in both cases much of the problem involves a crisis of confidence brought on by bad coaching. (I was tempted to say &quot;criminally negligent,&quot; but that term should be applied only in the most egregious situations&#x2014;like, say, the decision not to pull RG3 and his teetering knee from last year&#x2019;s playoff game against the Seahawks.) Yes, as you point out, defensive coordinators have spent the off-season studying up on the likes of RG3 and Kap, and have thrown a host of complex schemes at them. In response, the Niners have tried to turn Kap into a pocket-only genius like Peyton Manning&#x2014;and given the young man too damn much to think about. Kap <em>is</em> a football wonk, as studious and dedicated to film as any of them. But at least at this point, his talent is fueled by an intuitive, rather than a cognitive, genius. In no small part, the run-and-gun suits him because it limits what he has to think about it. It puts a much-needed cap on the Kap. More important, it makes him unpredictable, limiting and even obviating the complicated schemes those defensive coordinators cooked up in the off-season.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.i">In short, Norman and Harbaugh&#x2014;after going with the &quot;hot hand&quot; after Alex Smith concussed, and in effect saying, &quot;We trust <em>you&quot;</em>&#x2014;have put Kaepernick in an offensive scheme whose underlying message is: <em>We don&#x2019;t trust you.</em></p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.j">That said, there may be another, more ominous, reason Kaepernick is circling the drain this season. Would you like to know what that is, Brendan?      </p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>BV:</strong> Of course.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>AC: </strong>A cab driver in Indianapolis, a recent arrival from Morocco, let me in on this secret. After holding forth knowledgeably and eloquently on Peyton Manning and what he has meant, materially and symbolically, to the city of Indianapolis, he changed the subject.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.m">&quot;You speak of Aaron Hernandez...&quot; he began. I hadn&#x2019;t, but let him continue. &quot;And yet I tell you, my friend, before this football season is ended, there will be...<em>another murderer</em> in the NFL. Would you like to know who this will be?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.n">Yes, I said. I would.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.o">&quot;Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers! Would you like to know <em>why?&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.p">Yes, I said. I would.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.q">&quot;Three reasons,&quot; my cabbie said. &quot;The first is the color of his skin. The tone is <em>identical</em> to that of Aaron Hernandez. They could be <em>brothers! </em>The second is the tattoos. Colin Kaepernick himself <em>may not be aware of this,</em> but inside the tattoos that cover his body are many signs and symbols that speak of the Devil and his intentions! Finally, and <em>most important,</em> Colin Kaepernick lives and plays in San Francisco&#x2014;a city of <em>most unholy temptations.</em> In San Francisco, a man can walk naked through the streets holding hands with another naked man! Most unholy. If Colin Kaepernick were to be traded to Indianapolis, he could marry an Indiana farm girl, raised on eating corn, with good values! But that is not to happen. So, my friend, I tell you again, before this season has ended, Colin Kaepernick will become...<em>a murderer!&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.r">&quot;That is an extraordinary prediction,&quot; I offered.</p><p data-reactid=".20kcv8zb4sg.1.1.0.0.4.s">&quot;Nobody knows who his father is,&quot; my cabbie said.

And so should you, Brendan. So should you. That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;m saying.
