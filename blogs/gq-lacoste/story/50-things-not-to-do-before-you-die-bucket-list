  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A1. HAVE SEX ON A PLANE.\u000A\u000ANormally, this kind of thing should be written by someone who has actually had sex on an airplane. But I have never had sex on an airplane, and I have come to the realization that I\u0027m going to be okay. If I find out I have a rare blood disorder that will kill me in four days, I\u0027m not going to sit around wishing I\u0027d bent some woman over the sink 30,000 feet above Halifax. Well, not for more than like five seconds, anyway. Sex in public places is fun. (Like on trains.) But being expected to have sex on a commercial jetliner at some point in your life kind of takes the fun out of it. You\u0027re just coaxing your girlfriend into the lavatory so you don\u0027t feel like a loser the next time someone asks you if you\u0027re in the Mile High Club. It\u0027s one of many stupid things we weakly accept as a metric of manhood. It\u0027s uncomfortable enough to even sit on an airplane, let alone grapple with complex anatomical physics near a vacuum-flush toilet.—Devin Friedman\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A 2. TAME A WILD HORSE.\u000A\u000A3. GO TO GRACELAND.\u000A\u000A4. JOIN A FOOD CO-OP.\u000A\u000AI know, I know. The prices are great. The vegetables are stunningly fresh—carrots brighter than highway cones, lettuce as crisp as Doritos. I know that a local food co-op is a good community business, one that supports small farmers instead of scary agribusinesses, like the big corporate supermarkets do. But I don\u0027t have to mop the big corporate supermarket. To join my local food co-op, I have to put in a couple of unpaid hours a month, and I don\u0027t want to do it. Not because I\u0027m afraid of hard labor; I just don\u0027t want to become one of those food—co-op people—you know, the folks who know too much about coffee-bean production and get a little righteous about shiitake mushrooms. I\u0027ll stick to the big corporate supermarket, where what I don\u0027t know may, in fact, kill me, but at least I don\u0027t have to punch in.—Jason Gay\u000A\u000A 5. COME TO TERMS WITH YOUR ANGER.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A6. GET A MOWHAWK.\u000A\u000AI didn\u0027t feel sick exactly, but nervous and spacey, as Damien, the haircut guy, shaved half my head. He sensed my confidence caving and boosted me up, said it would look great. He had a Mohawk, too, so obviously he liked them. \u0022It looks very professional,\u0022 he said when he finished.\u000A\u000AI walked outside, diaper bag over my shoulder, eating a free lollipop, and pushing the baby in the stroller. I could feel the air dancing on my skull, like a thick layer of cold cream cheese. It was Saturday night on 18th Street, and the sidewalk was packed, and I wanted to get home. I was 41 years old, I had a Mohawk, and I wanted my hair back.\u000A\u000AThat next morning, walking outside to my car, I couldn\u0027t breathe. I moved frozenly, praying nobody would connect this head with me. My neighbor, a geriatric physician, his all-knowing, all-nosy wife, and their kids pulled up in their van. I went back inside and canceled my adjustment at the chiropractor. I couldn\u0027t do it. Look at me. I\u0027m ridiculous.\u000A\u000AIt has been a week now, and I\u0027m shaving it off soon. It took me four days just to show the nanny, Blanca, who spends six hours a day in my house. I wore a corduroy ski hat until I couldn\u0027t stand it anymore, and then called out from around the corner, with my head showing, and warned her not to be afraid. She laughed and said I needed an earring, so I figured nobody cared.\u000A\u000AI guess there was a time, maybe around 1973, maybe in London, when the Mohawk stood for defiance. My senior year in high school, the toughest jocks on the lacrosse team gave themselves Mohawks, and ever since I\u0027ve thought of it as an act of intensity and testicular showmanship. But in the twenty years since high school, I\u0027ve come to see hairdos like this one as an admission of utter defeat, and I\u0027ve come to hate people who walk around with overt hair or self-mutilation statements; I think, Hey, idiot, try getting attention from some real accomplishment. I\u0027m not looking at you. But maybe the reason I ended up with this on my head is that I feel that defeat, too, a little bit more lately. I\u0027ve had my ups and downs.\u000A\u000AI guess in these past six days, walking to the grocery store, watching the faces of old men as I join them in the YMCA Jacuzzi, I\u0027ve gained a greater appreciation for the act of elective self-destruction. Now when I see the heavily tattooed arms of a waiter, I feel a twinge of recognition. It\u0027s a sign, but not of defiance, or of defeat. There\u0027s something about exposing the flanks of your head while the top stays hairy as a way to confess your suffering. Like scars from a real suicide attempt, it\u0027s an admission of desperation and fragility, except that this, thank God, grows out in a few weeks.\u000A\u000AAnd it will be gone soon. But even now, I\u0027ll still forget I have it on my head until I catch my reflection. Then I\u0027ll examine the peach fuzz on the sides and the rooster tail on top, and I\u0027ll smile, the way you smile when you see a homeless person, passed out on the sidewalk, by some chicken bones, in a great Hawaiian shirt.—Matthew Klam\u000A\u000A  NEXT: ATTEND BURNING MAN &amp;gt;&amp;gt;\u000A\u000A7. ATTEND BURNING MAN.\u000A\u000A8. UNDERSTAND THE THEORY OF RELATIVITY.\u000A\u000A9. DELIVER A BABY WHILE TRAPPED IN AN ELEVATOR.\u000A\u000A10. BE A DRUG MULE.\u000A\u000AThere are tons of neat things about working for drug dealers: You don\u0027t have to pay tas, you never have to wake up before noon, and you can pretty much wear whatever you want. But I\u0027ve worked for drug dealers, and honestly, most of the time it\u0027s a drag. Though you do little more than wait around while other people talk and talk and talk on the phone, those people on the phone can be kind of uptight. In fact, they\u0027re dicks. The pay\u0027s okay, but it often comes in the form of white powder that disappears in a single, fuzzy twenty-four-hour period. And while it made me feel like a badass, I\u0027m not really sure I\u0027d recommend it. The thrill is short-lived, and all you\u0027re left with is the pathetic little story about the time you were young and stupid enough to fly with a brick of coke in your carry-on. And do you really want to be the guy who\u0027s still telling that story when he\u0027s 53?—Alden Gunn\u000A\u000A 11. CHANGE YOUR OWN OIL.\u000A\u000A12. REMEMBER WHICH ONE\u0027S MONTANA.\u000A\u000A13. BIG-WAVE SURFING.\u000A\u000ASmall-wave surfing\u0027s fun, too.\u000A\u000A 14. CERAMICS!\u000A\u000A15. DROP ACID.\u000A\u000A16. MEMORIZE THE U.S. PRESIDENTS IN ORDER.\u000A\u000A17. GROW A MUSTACHE.\u000A\u000AIrony has its limits. And when irony takes the form of bushy hair that grows on your upper lip, it can become quite a nuisance. It\u0027s not the maintenance so much—the brushing and the trimming and having to carefully shave around it. It\u0027s the sight of your hairy, stupid self in the bathroom mirror every morning. (Do you know what it\u0027s like waking up with a hangover and a mustache?) There\u0027s also the shame you feel when you see an old girlfriend or colleague. And the persistent urge you feel to inform every new person that you meet that, hey, you know, the mustache—it\u0027s really just a goof. A lark. Zany, right? After a few weeks, it isn\u0027t the mustache that you loathe, it\u0027s just you. Silly, vain, unfuckable you. But irony, in this particular form, can do more than inspire deep self-hatred. Sometimes it can stink—like six hours after you\u0027ve eaten some organic yogurt or slurped a half-dozen Malpeques. And the beauty part is, you\u0027re the only one who has to smell it.—Mark Healy\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A 18. HAVE A KID.\u000A\u000AKids will change your life. But what if you don\u0027t want your life changed? What if you like having the freedom to, say, jet to South Beach for the weekend? Which would be great, of course, but it would mean you\u0027d have to skip that dinner party and pass on the chance to spend the evening with four other parent-age couples as they go on and on and on about nannies, and school districts, and poopie!, and how last night one father slept only two hours (seriously, dude, two hours!) because little Max had the worst ear infection. Is it selfish not to bring another child into the world, care for him, and give him a quality life? Maybe. But there are plenty of charitable things you can do with your time. And I imagine Marc Jacobs will get by without selling one more $200 cashmere toddler sweater.—Reid Bixler\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A 19. SWIM WITH SHARKS.\u000A\u000A My fiancée and I were in Australia, and she wanted to \u0022swim with sharks.\u0022 I, of course, said hell no. Jews don\u0027t swim with sharks. She begged and pleaded and obliquely questioned my masculinity, so I relented. But we didn\u0027t do it the way she wanted to—which was in a shark cage in the open ocean. We did it my way, in a shark tank up on land. I figured I\u0027d rather they be captive in my world than the other way around. And the sharks weren\u0027t the kind with scary names like great white or hammerhead. No, these sharks were nurse sharks. And that\u0027s because they might as well wear little white skirts to work. They don\u0027t eat people. In fact, they were completely nonchalant. So, after our jaunt with the nurses didn\u0027t quite ignite my ex, she decided she wanted the great whites in the open ocean. She actually said, \u0022Isn\u0027t that something you want to do before you die?\u0022 I answered, \u0022The list of things I have to do before I die doesn\u0027t include things that might actually precipitate my death.\u0022 So I called off the wedding.—Michael Seitzman\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A 20. VIDEOTAPE YOURSELF HAVING SEX.\u000A\u000ASo you want to join the classy, classy ranks of people like Tommy Lee, Paris Hilton, and Colin Farrell? Hold up. Did you ever stare at a television and blurt out, \u0022Why would the Nazis film their atrocities?\u0022 Or \u0022Why didn\u0027t Nixon just burn those tapes?\u0022 Do you see a pattern here?\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re probably thinking that the production values will be, at worst, like third-rate porn. Wrong. Your videotape will have no zooms, no pans, and no movement whatsoever. Have you ever been turned on by a convenience-store surveillance video? Because that\u0027s what you\u0027re working on. You\u0027re working on one of those, and you\u0027re nude.\u000A\u000AIf that\u0027s not reason enough, there\u0027s the Discussion. It goes a little like this:\u000A\u000A\u0022I think I should keep the tape, because I\u0027ll be more careful with it.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You? I\u0027m more reliable!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Why is this even an issue? Are you planning on us not being together in the future? I want to break up.\u0022\u000A\u000AAs for the nuclear option—showing such a tape to anyone else or releasing it into the permanent indictment that is the Internet—just put that out of your mind. Really, you might as well drive to her workplace, shoot her and everyone else you see, then take your own life. Actually, it\u0027s my long-held theory that amateur sex videos are the direct cause of most office murders, but the FBI has ignored me for many years on this score, and shame on them. Though I guess that\u0027s a story for another day.\u000A\u000A(Special to Wendy H.: I destroyed that tape. I totally did.)—Marshall Sella\u000A\u000A  NEXT: SAIL AROUND CAPE HORN &amp;gt;&amp;gt;\u000A\u000A 21. SAIL AROUND CAPE HORN.\u000A\u000A22. ROAD-TRIP ON THE PCH OR OTHER SIMILARLY ICONIC ROUTES.\u000A\u000AThe Pacific Coast highway? Beautiful. And clogged with douche bags in rented Mustang convertibles. The Blue Ridge Parkway is a parking lot in the summer. And then there\u0027s that old travel-magazine staple: the Mississippi Delta. Southern delicacies! Authentic juke joints! Binge drinkers in Duke hats eating $45 crawfish! Just like Robert Johnson did.—Josh Dean\u000A\u000A 23. MANAGE A HEDGE FUND.\u000A\u000A24. RUN A MARATHON.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s supposed to be pretty amazing to finish a marathon—once the nausea and chills are gone and the blood has stopped leaking from various orifices. And to those who do it, we say: Bravo. But a man should not consider himself deficient just because he\u0027s never run 26.2 miles on the same day. Obsessed people are meant to run marathons; the rest of us are meant to run for a half hour and drink a light beer. And not only does training for a long-distance race overtake your life, but it also may benefit you less than simply hitting a treadmill a few times a week would. So the next time you feel guilty, recite these facts:\u000A\u000A Jim Fixx, the author of The Complete Book of Running, who did more than anyone else to popularize jogging in America, died at 52, in midstride, of a massive heart attack.\u000A\u000A Of 488 runners studied at the 2002 Boston Marathon, 13 percent developed hyponatremia, a potentially fatal condition caused by drinking too much water.\u000A\u000A To quote the Harvard Health Letter, \u0022Long distance running can cause gastrointestinal bleeding.\u0022 That\u0027s not to mention the bleeding nipples.—Nate Penn\u000A\u000A 25. BANG A HILTON SISTER.\u000A\u000A26. EAT A BLOWFISH.\u000A\u000A27. EAT SHEEP TESTICLES.\u000A\u000AOr any other testicles, really.\u000A\u000A 28. RIDE A MOTORCYCLE ACROSS A CURRENT OR FORMER COMMUNIST COUNTRY.\u000A\u000AYou always say you want to ride across a country on your chopper before it\u0027s all over, preferably a really romantic kind of place, maybe Vietnam, possibly Cuba, definitely someplace that used to have a politburo. But before you fasten your leather helmet\u0027s chin strap, consider the following question. Have you ever ridden your bike on anything but nice, smooth, First World blacktop? Because in, say, Cuba, the roads will leave you bruised and battered. You will go days without an Arby\u0027s or even a Cracker Barrel. On a good day, you\u0027ll perhaps get to poop over a hole in the floor of a shack. I once drove across much of Russia, and it was horrible—exciting and sort of thrilling in its peril, yes, but even in a country with abundant concrete and toilets that flush, the journey was harrowing, and nearly fatal to my vehicle. And that was an SUV.—Josh Dean\u000A\u000A 29. JOIN A REVOLUTIONARY PARTY.\u000A\u000A30. LEARN HOW TO DRIVE A STICK SHIFT.\u000A\u000AEvery girlfriend I\u0027ve ever had has the same two complaints about me: I\u0027m not totally in touch with my feelings, and I can\u0027t drive a stick shift. I\u0027m still working on the former, but I\u0027m giving up on the latter. Because, seriously: Who cares? People tell you that a manual transmission makes you feel more in control of the car, more \u0022at one\u0022 with the machine. I\u0027m sure that\u0027s a neat sensation in a Bugatti. But I don\u0027t need to be more \u0022at one\u0022 with a piece-of-shit Subaru. Not knowing how to drive a stick shift is one of those things that seem like a big deal when you\u0027re young but turn out to be pretty meaningless when you\u0027re older. Like trigonometry or Christmas.—Jason Gay\u000A\u000A 31. BLOG.\u000A\u000AYour audience at the company cafeteria is bigger than what you\u0027ll have on the Internet.\u000A\u000A 32. BOMB THE HAHNENKAMM.\u000A\u000AThe hahnenkamm\u0027s streif, the infamous Austrian downhill ski run, opens with a forty-five-degree fall and features a life-threatening 180-degree turn. Even snow-grooming machines can\u0027t traverse its angles. Oh, and the maintenance crews spray the whole mountain down with cold water, turning it into a giant luge. It\u0027s the ski run perhaps most famous for its tendency to nearly kill people. And that makes it really attractive to more than a few ding-dongs out to prove their willingness to be killed.—Mickey Rapkin\u000A\u000A 33. STOP WORKING FOR THE MAN.\u000A\u000AEveryday you drag your ass to work in your monkey suit and get served up a big, steaming pile of humiliation by your boss. And what do you do? You eat it. It\u0027s like The Matrix, man! It\u0027s like you\u0027re a zombie, an automaton with the psycho-emotional breadth of Keanu Reeves! And that ain\u0027t you, man! You\u0027re a free spirit! You know everything would change if you could just tell the boss to fuck off. And sure, there may be some truth to that. Especially if your job is marketing cigarettes to teenagers. But for most people, quitting sets you free for five or six days max. Then you\u0027re like: What happens if I get a cavity? Or: Hey, I like flat-screen TVs. Just remember how much you enjoy talking shit about your coworkers. And fantasizing about quitting. Why would you give that up?—Devin Friedman\u000A\u000A 34. FIND THE VILLAGE IN IRELAND WHERE YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS BORN.\u000A\u000A35. READ \u0027ULYSSES.\u0027\u000A\u000A36. MARDI GRAS.\u000A\u000A  NEXT: RENOVATE YOUR HOUSE &amp;gt;&amp;gt;\u000A\u000A37. RENOVATE YOUR HOUSE.\u000A\u000AA couple of things occurred to me in fairly quick succession as I was changing a light fixture in my kitchen, taking down this extraordinarily ugly fake Tiffany stained-glass hanging shade the size of an SUV tire and putting in its place a little $20 track-lighting job from Ikea. I was standing on a stool, one whose seat spun around, balancing the very heavy fruit shade on one outstretched arm and reaching up with the other to disconnect the knot of wires exploding out of the ceiling.\u000A\u000AHere\u0027s what occurred to me: (1) I\u0027d forgotten to turn the power off at the fuse box down in my basement. (2) I had no idea which wires were hot. (3) My wife and kids were out and wouldn\u0027t be back anytime soon. (4) It was impossible to get off the spinning stool without either falling or dropping the monstrous fruit shade, which would shatter all over the kitchen floor, or both.\u000A\u000ASo I stood there on top of a spinning bar stool, holding a thirty-pound lampshade and staring up into the maw in my ceiling long enough for my legs and lower back to cramp and for me to make a plan that when the time came, I would toss the fake Tiffany fruit shade forward and leap backward so that while I broke some bones, at least I wouldn\u0027t also get impaled by a shard of stained glass.\u000A\u000AEventually, my wife came home, and I called an electrician.\u000A\u000AYou read about people who don\u0027t know jack about home repair taking on a renovation by themselves, and there\u0027s always some lesson about how with each humbling experience they learn something they didn\u0027t know before about who they are and how they connected to their home in some profound ways that men in the modern world have lost touch with.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s all a load of crap. I\u0027m not joking when I say that things with the fruit lamp could\u0027ve gotten very ugly very quickly. Multiply that little scenario by a jillion and you have a rough idea of what it\u0027s like to actually renovate your own place.\u000A\u000AIf you\u0027re anything like me, accept that there are skills you\u0027re just never going to have. So you\u0027re good with books or computers or numbers but not with tools? Stay away from the tools. The man you think is lurking inside of you, waiting for some belt sander to reveal him to the world, he\u0027s full of shit, and chances are he\u0027ll end up in the ER. Or living in a really crappily renovated home, wishing he hadn\u0027t been such a macho-romantic jackass.—Joel Lovell\u000A\u000A 38. FLY AN AIRPLANE.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A39. TAKE THAT ITALIAN-COOKING CLASS IN TUSCANY.\u000A\u000A40. CATCH AND RELEASE A MARLIN.\u000A\u000A41. SPELUNK.\u000A\u000A42. RUN WITH THE BULLS.\u000A\u000ASometimes it\u0027s the fate of a good writer to bear the blame for what he inspires a bunch of idiots to do. Hunter S. Thompson is on the hook for a generation convinced it\u0027s charming to be a drug-addicted asshole. Jack Kerouac spawned a million annoying vagabonds. And then, of course, there\u0027s Ernest Hemingway, who has to answer not only for reams of bad, muscular prose but also for turning the San Ferm&amp;#xED;n festival, celebrated in the town of Pamplona, Spain, into a three-minute institutionalized rite of passage, offering a frisson of real danger to the proceedings without being automatically fatal. It\u0027s worth remembering, though, that courting death is not, ipso facto, cool. If there were a contest in Toledo where you drank a bottle of Drano and saw what happened, would you be proud to tell stories about it over dinner?—Brett Martin\u000A\u000A 43. Be Lady Godiva.\u000A\u000Apeople always say you have to ride a horse bareback, on a beach, with your long hair flowing behind you, naked, before you die. But you don\u0027t have to do that. I would say that there\u0027s a whole category of stuff you shouldn\u0027t do naked, and riding a horse is at the top of the list.\u000A\u000AIf you\u0027re a man, you shouldn\u0027t even walk around naked. If you\u0027re a woman, fine, although for women who think men are whiners, try having your tits attached to your pussy and have them swinging between your legs. Walking naked for a man is tricky enough, depending on how low his balls hang. Jogging naked can give you a headache very quickly. Jogging is to horseback riding as ice-skating is to ice hockey.\u000A\u000AMaybe you admire horses. Horses are fine to sit on while they stand still. But as soon as that horse starts stepping forward, you\u0027re like, \u0022Maybe it\u0027s the pants. My ass hurts. I\u0027m getting pinched nuts.\u0022 Now imagine no shiny padded-leather saddle. No stirrups to help you lift your balls up when the horse bounces. Because as soon as you get out of the walk, into the trot, the canter, the gallop, you\u0027d better know what you\u0027re doing, and even if you do, you don\u0027t want to do it with your hair flowing behind you, freely blowing in the seaborne air.—Matthew Klam\u000A\u000A 44. Climb Mount Kilimanjaro.\u000A\u000AIf you end up doing it, please don\u0027t talk to us about it for more than ten minutes.\u000A\u000A  TAKE A YEAR OFF &amp;gt;&amp;gt;\u000A\u000A 45. Take a year off.\u000A\u000A46. Gaze upon the ruins of Pompeii.\u000A\u000AI once spent a week in Pompeii, and I don\u0027t remember a single fresco. Or the mosaic of Alexander\u0027s conquest over Darius in the House of Faun. This is what I mostly remember about Pompeii: dogs. Big, stray dogs. Everywhere. With overgrown coats and gnarly premolars. I also remember the transvestite hookers who humped wildly in cars parked in my hotel\u0027s lot. Which to me isn\u0027t something a man needs to see before he dies.—Greg Veis\u000A\u000A 47. See Michelangelo\u0027s David.\u000A\u000AThere are great works of art, and then there are the \u0022Things to Do\u0022 masterpieces—those works of art so mired in their own fame they\u0027re more like a Brad Pitt sighting than a cultural experience. The Mona Lisa. The Last Supper.Monet, that prominent freshman-dorm-room decorator. And it\u0027s perhaps David—available in paperweight, refrigerator magnet, or bor-shorts form—that is the worst offender. Seeing him in person won\u0027t change your life. You won\u0027t immediately toss your BlackBerry in the Arno, and dedicate your life to aesthetic pursuits. Here\u0027s what will happen: You\u0027ll wait in line for three hours (there\u0027s no EZ Pass for culture, my friend) with pretentious Boston College art-history majors. And then the moment of truth: You stand in front of the seventeen-foot-tall David wondering, What does everyone else get that I don\u0027t? The answer for most of those people is: nothing. They\u0027re just here because that\u0027s what you\u0027re supposed to do in Florence. Maybe it\u0027d be different if you weren\u0027t expecting so much, but we\u0027ll never know.—Danielle Pergament\u000A\u000A 48. Swim the English Channel.\u000A\u000AJust take the Chunnel train. It\u0027s fast and dark and a little scary. And you can eat good sandwiches and drink wine while you do it.\u000A\u000A 49. Stop lying.\u000A\u000AI can\u0027t be trusted. Not everything I say—even to my wife or my kids—is true. Which is just another way of saying that I lie. I don\u0027t feel bad about this, really, and you shouldn\u0027t, either. (Because you lie, too.) The wee, harmless fib—I\u0027m not talking here about matters of life, death, or infidelity—is an elemental part of human interaction. It allows you to show (feigned) interest, to (falsely) flatter, to express (disingenuous) gratitude—all of which are not only necessary but good. Without these kinds of lies, we\u0027d never leave the house. Life would feel unsafe, grim, a little too realistic. If I give someone a birthday present, for example, and that person doesn\u0027t like it, I\u0027d much prefer that he\u0027d smile and keep that shit to himself. It\u0027s the people who won\u0027t or can\u0027t bring themselves to lie that you really have to watch out for. Ever had a friend who—in the thrall of recovery, sudden religiosity, or a New Year\u0027s resolution gone haywire—announces that he will, from this day forward, refrain from ever lying again? And have you also noticed how insufferable that person then becomes in the month or two—about as long as these things tend to last—that he devotes himself to Truth? Taking the white lie off the table doesn\u0027t always make you more noble or pure; sometimes it makes you the biggest asshole at the party.—Andy Ward\u000A\u000A50. Follow a list in a magazine.",

HAVE SEX ON A PLANE.</em></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.2">Normally, this kind of thing should be written by someone who has actually had sex on an airplane. But I have never had sex on an airplane, and I have come to the realization that I&#x2019;m going to be okay. If I find out I have a rare blood disorder that will kill me in four days, I&#x2019;m not going to sit around wishing I&#x2019;d bent some woman over the sink 30,000 feet above Halifax. Well, not for more than like five seconds, anyway. Sex in public places is fun. (Like on trains.) But being expected to have sex on a commercial jetliner at some point in your life kind of takes the fun out of it. You&#x2019;re just coaxing your girlfriend into the lavatory so you don&#x2019;t feel like a loser the next time someone asks you if you&#x2019;re in the Mile High Club. It&#x2019;s one of many stupid things we weakly accept as a metric of manhood. It&#x2019;s uncomfortable enough to even sit on an airplane, let alone grapple with complex anatomical physics near a vacuum-flush toilet.<em>&#x2014;Devin Friedman</em></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.3"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c9a51177d66d68d58b2d/master/w_806/how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-1.jpg" alt="how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-1.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;t=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-1.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;t=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-1.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9a51177d66d68d58b2d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhow-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-1.jpg&amp;description=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-1.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9a51177d66d68d58b2d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhow-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-1.jpg&amp;description=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-1.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <em>2.

GET A MOWHAWK.</em></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.c">I didn&#x2019;t feel sick exactly, but nervous and spacey, as Damien, the haircut guy, shaved half my head. He sensed my confidence caving and boosted me up, said it would look great. He had a Mohawk, too, so obviously he liked them. &quot;It looks very professional,&quot; he said when he finished.</p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.d">I walked outside, diaper bag over my shoulder, eating a free lollipop, and pushing the baby in the stroller. I could feel the air dancing on my skull, like a thick layer of cold cream cheese. It was Saturday night on 18th Street, and the sidewalk was packed, and I wanted to get home. I was 41 years old, I had a Mohawk, and I wanted my hair back.</p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.e">That next morning, walking outside to my car, I couldn&#x2019;t breathe. I moved frozenly, praying nobody would connect this head with me. My neighbor, a geriatric physician, his all-knowing, all-nosy wife, and their kids pulled up in their van. I went back inside and canceled my adjustment at the chiropractor. I couldn&#x2019;t do it. Look at me. I&#x2019;m ridiculous.</p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.f">It has been a week now, and I&#x2019;m shaving it off soon. It took me four days just to show the nanny, Blanca, who spends six hours a day in my house. I wore a corduroy ski hat until I couldn&#x2019;t stand it anymore, and then called out from around the corner, with my head showing, and warned her not to be afraid. She laughed and said I needed an earring, so I figured nobody cared.</p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.g">I guess there was a time, maybe around 1973, maybe in London, when the Mohawk stood for defiance. My senior year in high school, the toughest jocks on the lacrosse team gave themselves Mohawks, and ever since I&#x2019;ve thought of it as an act of intensity and testicular showmanship. But in the twenty years since high school, I&#x2019;ve come to see hairdos like this one as an admission of utter defeat, and I&#x2019;ve come to hate people who walk around with overt hair or self-mutilation statements; I think, Hey, idiot, try getting attention from some real accomplishment. I&#x2019;m not looking at you. But maybe the reason I ended up with this on my head is that I feel that defeat, too, a little bit more lately. I&#x2019;ve had my ups and downs.</p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.h">I guess in these past six days, walking to the grocery store, watching the faces of old men as I join them in the YMCA Jacuzzi, I&#x2019;ve gained a greater appreciation for the act of elective self-destruction. Now when I see the heavily tattooed arms of a waiter, I feel a twinge of recognition. It&#x2019;s a sign, but not of defiance, or of defeat. There&#x2019;s something about exposing the flanks of your head while the top stays hairy as a way to confess your suffering. Like scars from a real suicide attempt, it&#x2019;s an admission of desperation and fragility, except that this, thank God, grows out in a few weeks.</p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.i">And it will be gone soon. But even now, I&#x2019;ll still forget I have it on my head until I catch my reflection. Then I&#x2019;ll examine the peach fuzz on the sides and the rooster tail on top, and I&#x2019;ll smile, the way you smile when you see a homeless person, passed out on the sidewalk, by some chicken bones, in a great Hawaiian shirt.<em>&#x2014;Matthew Klam</em></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.j"> <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/humor/200609/50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list?currentPage=2"> NEXT: ATTEND BURNING MAN &amp;gt;&amp;gt;</a></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.k"><em>7.

But I&#x2019;ve worked for drug dealers, and honestly, most of the time it&#x2019;s a drag. Though you do little more than wait around while other people talk and talk and talk on the phone, those people on the phone can be kind of uptight. In fact, they&#x2019;re dicks. The pay&#x2019;s okay, but it often comes in the form of white powder that disappears in a single, fuzzy twenty-four-hour period. And while it made me feel like a badass, I&#x2019;m not really sure I&#x2019;d recommend it. The thrill is short-lived, and all you&#x2019;re left with is the pathetic little story about the time you were young and stupid enough to fly with a brick of coke in your carry-on.

And when irony takes the form of bushy hair that grows on your upper lip, it can become quite a nuisance. It&#x2019;s not the maintenance so much&#x2014;the brushing and the trimming and having to carefully shave around it. It&#x2019;s the sight of your hairy, stupid self in the bathroom mirror every morning. (Do you know what it&#x2019;s like waking up with a hangover <em>and</em> a mustache?) There&#x2019;s also the shame you feel when you see an old girlfriend or colleague. And the persistent urge you feel to inform every new person that you meet that, hey, you know, the mustache&#x2014;it&#x2019;s really just a goof. A lark. Zany, right? After a few weeks, it isn&#x2019;t the mustache that you loathe, it&#x2019;s just you. Silly, vain, unfuckable you. But irony, in this particular form, can do more than inspire deep self-hatred. Sometimes it can stink&#x2014;like six hours after you&#x2019;ve eaten some organic yogurt or slurped a half-dozen Malpeques. And the beauty part is, you&#x2019;re the only one who has to smell it.<em>&#x2014;Mark Healy</em></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.y"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c9a41177d66d68d58b2b/master/w_806/how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-3.jpg" alt="how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-3.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;t=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-3.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;t=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-3.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9a41177d66d68d58b2b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhow-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-3.jpg&amp;description=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-3.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9a41177d66d68d58b2b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhow-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-3.jpg&amp;description=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-3.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.z"> <em>18.

What if you like having the freedom to, say, jet to South Beach for the weekend? Which would be great, of course, but it would mean you&#x2019;d have to skip that dinner party and pass on the chance to spend the evening with four other parent-age couples as they go on and on and on about nannies, and school districts, and poopie!, and how last night one father slept only two hours (seriously, dude, two hours!) because little Max had the worst ear infection. Is it selfish not to bring another child into the world, care for him, and give him a quality life? Maybe. But there are plenty of charitable things you can do with your time.

Jews don&#x2019;t swim with sharks. She begged and pleaded and obliquely questioned my masculinity, so I relented. But we didn&#x2019;t do it the way she wanted to&#x2014;which was in a shark cage in the open ocean. We did it my way, in a shark tank up on land. I figured I&#x2019;d rather they be captive in my world than the other way around. And the sharks weren&#x2019;t the kind with scary names like great white or hammerhead. No, these sharks were nurse sharks. And that&#x2019;s because they might as well wear little white skirts to work. They don&#x2019;t eat people. In fact, they were completely nonchalant. So, after our jaunt with the nurses didn&#x2019;t quite ignite my ex, she decided she wanted the great whites in the open ocean. She actually said, &quot;Isn&#x2019;t that something you want to do before you die?&quot; I answered, &quot;The list of things I have to do before I die doesn&#x2019;t include things that might actually precipitate my death.&quot; So I called off the wedding.<em>&#x2014;Michael Seitzman</em></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.14"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c9a5e52bc4b477a9d9aa/master/w_806/how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-5.jpg" alt="how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-5.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;t=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-5.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;t=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-5.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9a5e52bc4b477a9d9aa%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhow-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-5.jpg&amp;description=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-5.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F50-things-not-to-do-before-you-die-bucket-list&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9a5e52bc4b477a9d9aa%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhow-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-5.jpg&amp;description=how-to-2012-05-50-things-inset-5.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.15"> <em>20.

But before you fasten your leather helmet&#x2019;s chin strap, consider the following question. Have you ever ridden your bike on anything but nice, smooth, First World blacktop? Because in, say, Cuba, the roads will leave you bruised and battered. You will go days without an Arby&#x2019;s or even a Cracker Barrel. On a good day, you&#x2019;ll perhaps get to poop over a hole in the floor of a shack. I once drove across much of Russia, and it was horrible&#x2014;exciting and sort of thrilling in its peril, yes, but even in a country with abundant concrete and toilets that flush, the journey was harrowing, and nearly fatal to my vehicle.

I would say that there&#x2019;s a whole category of stuff you shouldn&#x2019;t do naked, and riding a horse is at the top of the list.</p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.2o">If you&#x2019;re a man, you shouldn&#x2019;t even walk around naked. If you&#x2019;re a woman, fine, although for women who think men are whiners, try having your tits attached to your pussy and have them swinging between your legs. Walking naked for a man is tricky enough, depending on how low his balls hang. Jogging naked can give you a headache very quickly. Jogging is to horseback riding as ice-skating is to ice hockey.</p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.2p">Maybe you admire horses. Horses are fine to sit on while they stand still. But as soon as that horse starts stepping forward, you&#x2019;re like, &quot;Maybe it&#x2019;s the pants. My ass hurts. I&#x2019;m getting pinched nuts.&quot; Now imagine no shiny padded-leather saddle. No stirrups to help you lift your balls up when the horse bounces. Because as soon as you get out of the walk, into the trot, the canter, the gallop, you&#x2019;d better know what you&#x2019;re doing, and even if you do, you don&#x2019;t want to do it with your hair flowing behind you, freely blowing in the seaborne air.<em>&#x2014;Matthew Klam</em></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.2q"> <em>44.

Gaze upon the ruins of Pompeii.</em></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.2v">I once spent a week in Pompeii, and I don&#x2019;t remember a single fresco. Or the mosaic of Alexander&#x2019;s conquest over Darius in the House of Faun. This is what I mostly remember about Pompeii: dogs. Big, stray dogs. Everywhere. With overgrown coats and gnarly premolars. I also remember the transvestite hookers who humped wildly in cars parked in my hotel&#x2019;s lot. Which to me isn&#x2019;t something a man needs to see before he dies.<em>&#x2014;Greg Veis</em></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.2w"> <em>47. See Michelangelo&#x2019;s David.</em></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.2x">There are great works of art, and then there are the &quot;Things to Do&quot; masterpieces&#x2014;those works of art so mired in their own fame they&#x2019;re more like a Brad Pitt sighting than a cultural experience. The <em>Mona Lisa. The Last Supper.</em>Monet, that prominent freshman-dorm-room decorator. And it&#x2019;s perhaps <em>David</em>&#x2014;available in paperweight, refrigerator magnet, or bor-shorts form&#x2014;that is the worst offender. Seeing him in person won&#x2019;t change your life. You won&#x2019;t immediately toss your BlackBerry in the Arno, and dedicate your life to aesthetic pursuits. Here&#x2019;s what will happen: You&#x2019;ll wait in line for three hours (there&#x2019;s no EZ Pass for culture, my friend) with pretentious Boston College art-history majors. And then the moment of truth: You stand in front of the seventeen-foot-tall <em>David</em> wondering, What does everyone else get that I don&#x2019;t? The answer for most of those people is: nothing. They&#x2019;re just here because that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re supposed to do in Florence. Maybe it&#x2019;d be different if you weren&#x2019;t expecting so much, but we&#x2019;ll never know.<em>&#x2014;Danielle Pergament</em></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.2y"> <em>48. Swim the English Channel.</em></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.2z">Just take the Chunnel train. It&#x2019;s fast and dark and a little scary.

Stop lying.</em></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.31">I can&#x2019;t be trusted. Not everything I say&#x2014;even to my wife or my kids&#x2014;is true. Which is just another way of saying that I lie. I don&#x2019;t feel bad about this, really, and you shouldn&#x2019;t, either. (Because you lie, too.) The wee, harmless fib&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not talking here about matters of life, death, or infidelity&#x2014;is an elemental part of human interaction. It allows you to show (feigned) interest, to (falsely) flatter, to express (disingenuous) gratitude&#x2014;all of which are not only necessary but good. Without these kinds of lies, we&#x2019;d never leave the house. Life would feel unsafe, grim, a little too realistic. If I give someone a birthday present, for example, and that person doesn&#x2019;t like it, I&#x2019;d much prefer that he&#x2019;d smile and keep that shit to himself. It&#x2019;s the people who won&#x2019;t or can&#x2019;t bring themselves to lie that you really have to watch out for. Ever had a friend who&#x2014;in the thrall of recovery, sudden religiosity, or a New Year&#x2019;s resolution gone haywire&#x2014;announces that he will, from this day forward, refrain from ever lying again? And have you also noticed how insufferable that person then becomes in the month or two&#x2014;about as long as these things tend to last&#x2014;that he devotes himself to Truth? Taking the white lie off the table doesn&#x2019;t always make you more noble or pure; sometimes it makes you the biggest asshole at the party.<em>&#x2014;Andy Ward</em></p><p data-reactid=".22jf05di2v4.1.1.0.0.4.32"><em>50.
