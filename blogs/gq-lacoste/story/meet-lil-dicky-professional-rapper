  	    "articleBody": "Maybe you\u0027ve never heard of Lil Dicky. Maybe you have, and think he\u0027s just a funny guy who makes funny music. But the release of his debut album Professional Rapper in late July of this year made both of those possibilities much less likely. Because the not-so-subtly named album came with an equally unequivocal reality: The dude\u0027s here, and he can spit. \u000A\u000ADicky (whose real name is David Burd and who goes by many nicknames including Mr. Leftward-Sloping Penis, L-D, and Young Dick) made his name with a repertoire of well-produced, viral music videos, and a persona that\u0027s not so much a character as an exaggerated version of his own reality: a white, upper middle-class, Jewish, unkempt guy who raps about being white, getting too high, and the insecurities of meeting a new girl\u0027s ex-boyfriend. He markets himself as a sort of \u0022everyman,\u0022 which, of course, is only true if you share the same descriptors.\u000A\u000AWhile Professional Rapper remains joke-heavy, the beats, the flow, and the featured talent—Fetty Wap, Rich Homie Quan, T-Pain, Snoop Dogg—are not the least bit laughable. The album hit No. 1 on Billboard\u0027s top rap charts, and doesn\u0027t so much ask as it does demand you accept that even though the words might be funny, the idea of Lil Dicky as a rapper is not. We caught up with the man himself, who told us, among other things, what it\u0027s like to buy weed after you go viral.        \u000A\u000AThis interview has been edited and condensed.\u000A\u000AFair to assume you\u0027ve always been a fan of hip-hop?Yeah, I\u0027ve always been totally enamored by hip-hop. I wouldn\u0027t say I liked it exclusively growing up. It was like that and alt-rock. But I always preferred it. It set a tone for everything I wanted to do in life.\u000A\u000ASo it went beyond the phase every upper middle-class white kid goes through?It\u0027s the most self-expressive genre of music. From a raw emotion perspective. I don\u0027t listen to any other music at this point. Listening to the Goo Goo Dolls at this point ends up bumming me out.\u000A\u000AWhen did you start rapping yourself?Always done it very casually. I remember in fifth grade I did a history report on Alexander Pushkin via rap. \u000A\u000AI know when you dropped your \u0022Ex-Boyfriend\u0022 video, it got a million hits the first day, but was there a time before then that you realized you were pretty good at this rap thing?I kept the circle kind of small because I was so disinterested in my dreams being shot down. I didn\u0027t want to show people and have them be like, \u0022No shot. This is stupid.\u0022 It took me two years to make the mix tape [\u0022So Hard,\u0022 in April 2013]—or a year and half—and the videos. I just wanted to have hope alive the entire time. Because when you\u0027re creating, if you don\u0027t have maximum hope, you won\u0027t make the best product. I had two friends who said, yeah, you can rap, but I didn\u0027t know that their opinion actually held value. So to me, the first moment I actually did feel validation was the \u0022Ex-Boyfriend\u0022 day, because that\u0027s like objective, quantifiable data. \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhat was the night before that day like?It took me so long to get it to a place where I was happy. You only get one first impression, and I was finally at a point where I knew the next day I was going to put it online. And the night before I genuinely started crying. \u000A\u000A\u0022I love how supportive my parents are. But they know everything. I\u0027ll tweet something like \u0027Just had sex,\u0027 and my mom thinks it\u0027s, like, cool [to discuss].\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000AWow. Why?I had no idea what was going to happen. I just knew that I couldn\u0027t have made a better effort. It was just such a relief to know like, if you\u0027re not meant to do this, you\u0027re not meant to do it. But it won\u0027t be your fault. You totally did what you had to do and if it works, it works. I was just so happy the weight was off my shoulders. \u000A\u000AWhat do your parents think?It\u0027s great and I love how supportive they are. But they know everything. There\u0027s not a single move I can make without them knowing about it. I\u0027ll tweet something like \u0022Just had sex,\u0022 and then my mom thinks it\u0027s, like, cool [to discuss]. So I\u0027ve said so many times: If there\u0027s something you think I\u0027m not interested in talking with you about, odds are I\u0027m not. That\u0027s my whole shtick, like I\u0027m an open book. But man, do I not want to talk to my mom about certain things.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve been asked a lot whether you\u0027re a comedian who raps, or a rapper who\u0027s funny. And I saw somewhere you said you feel like you\u0027re \u0022locked in a room playing a rapper\u0022. Is that still the case after the success of this album? It\u0027s not that I\u0027m playing a rapper. I definitely feel like I\u0027m a legitimate rapper. I just think that who I am, there\u0027s more to me than just being a rapper. For the last three years, I\u0027ve just been that rapper. I haven\u0027t even been like the friend to my friends. I haven\u0027t even been the guy who writes scripts. I think I have more to offer society from a public-facing perspective and [in my] personal life, than just simply being a rapper. \u000A\u000AWhere is the line between David Burd and Lil Dicky?I think Lil Dicky is my rap spirit animal. He certainly wouldn\u0027t say anything that I didn\u0027t believe in. Both people like to joke around. I just think Lil Dicky is obviously the most unfiltered, uncensored version. He doesn\u0027t necessarily play by societal rules, whereas I\u0027m certainly in our society, and wouldn\u0027t be outlandish. I respect societal convention. Even a guy like Drake, he\u0027s got a rap spirit animal, and he probably raps different than he might act. I think everybody has their own inner rap spirit animal. \u000A\u000AStill have people who look past you because of your look?The other day I was doing a signing at CollegeFest in Boston. Some knew who I was and took pictures with me, and then other people saw people taking pictures and thought, \u0022This guy\u0027s famous.\u0022 I have a hype man named Gata whose got dreads and tattoos on his face. Someone walked up to me, handed me the phone and said, \u0022Can you take a picture of me and Lil Dicky?\u0022 I was like sure. They walk up to Gata and I take a picture. \u000A\u000AYou worked with some serious rappers on your album: Fetty Wap, T-Pain, Snoop Dogg. What\u0027s been the reception you\u0027ve had from guys in the rap game?Dude. Fantastic. I had an extreme concern about like—I don\u0027t just wanna be a sideshow freak in rap. I have no interest in being that guy. I want to be in the game, being able to make songs with everybody. Like you said, it\u0027s easy to see a guy rapping comedically and not take him seriously as a rapper, but I think rappers especially realize how much effort and detail goes into my raps. Beyond that, I think everybody likes to laugh. And hip-hop, to me, used to be all about having fun, and not that it\u0027s gone away from that, but it\u0027s definitely gotten kind of serious and hyper masculine, less self-deprecation than I think used to be in the day. I guess what I\u0027ve found is that if you \u0022go hard\u0022 and you\u0027re real, you\u0027re gonna get a lot of respect. So yeah, they love it. The rappers I\u0027ve met have been the most enthusiastic about what I\u0027m doing. \u000A\u000AIs that still nuts to you, that you\u0027re working with these guys?In the last six months, I\u0027ve felt like I\u0027m sitting in reality and looking at what\u0027s going on and feeling like I\u0027m living in a dream. Spending the day in Atlanta with Rich Homie Quan is like the most fun day ever. Two years ago if you told me that would be happening, I\u0027d literally be sitting in my cube daydreaming about such a thing. The other day I smoked weed for a video with Sarah Silverman. \u000A\u000AWhat did your drug dealer say the first time he sold to you after you went viral?So this guy in San Francisco was selling me weed, and I think he always liked me because it was always an interesting deal. I would go in his car and sometimes he would have his daughter in there, who was very young. I ended up asking the daughter all these questions, and it felt like a very interesting dynamic. Like, \u0022How\u0027s your day going?\u0022 as I hand her dad money. I\u0027d been doing it for like a year and half, and he somehow must have seen \u0022Ex-Boyfriend,\u0022 and he texts me like, \u0022Dude, what the fuck? You\u0027re a rapper?!\u0022 I think he felt like a sense of pride. I told him, Just so you know, my whole mixtape was created off of your weed. Your weed was the weed that inspired my rap career. \u000A\u000AWeed\u0027s a big part of your process, then?I used to smoke a lot less. I smoke more now than I ever have. I never really smoked in college even. Even now, I don\u0027t smoke until it\u0027s past 7 P.M. Like a glass of wine. And I try not to do it every day. I try to do it six days a week. It doesn\u0027t help write, but there\u0027s no way I can even start writing until I freestyle over a beat high and understand what my inner spirit rap animal, like how he sounds over it, what his attitude is. \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASome of your album isn\u0027t typical Dicky laugh raps, though. That song \u0022Molly\u0022 is pretty poignant—that come from a real experience?Yeah. That\u0027s my ex-girlfriend. Like I said, the same way that I think I\u0027m more than a rapper, I think, as a rapper, I don\u0027t have just funny things to say. Being funny is my biggest differentiator and I think I\u0027d be a fool not to use that, and there\u0027s nothing I enjoy personally more than making a human being laugh. But then I also think I have a serious side to me. Like, I\u0027m totally emotionally vulnerable. I love love. There\u0027s nothing more—being single to me is far less interesting to me than being in deep love. Not even close. I don\u0027t even think that\u0027s like a debate. So there\u0027s tons of different angles on my album. You couldn\u0027t listen to my album and not find one thing you liked. And I feel being diverse, not many rappers are that diverse. \u000A\u000ATrying to get people to take you seriously, does that make you want to move away from comedy or show them comedy can win?Show them that comedy can win. It\u0027s a song like \u0022$ave Dat Money,\u0022 with guys like Rich Homie Quan and Fetty Wap, where it sounds like a dope rap song. It\u0027s not just like a Lonely Island song and not gonna go on a hip hop radio station. No, it sounds like it should go on a hip-hop radio station.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s kind of like \u0022Lemme Freak,\u0022 because that is a pretty bomb-ass song, even outside its comedic value.I love \u0022Lemme Freak.\u0022 That hook is like an R. Kelly hook. It\u0027s the best the hook I\u0027ve ever written. \u000A\u000AQuick: Favorite jerseys you own.Jesus Shuttlesworth on Lincoln. Deion Sanders on the Braves. Jackie Robinson. Steph Curry, Davidson. Bo Jackson, powder blue Royals. I outsource them from China for $19 a pop. \u000A\u000AYou\u0027re a bad American.I\u0027m just not that wealthy yet. I\u0027m not paying like $180 for a jersey.\u000A\u000AMaybe when you\u0027re Big Dicky.Then I\u0027ll buy the real ones.\u000A\u000A",

<em>Professional Rapper</em></h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.0">Maybe you&apos;ve never heard of Lil Dicky. Maybe you have, and think he&apos;s just a funny guy who makes funny music. But the release of his debut album <em>Professional Rapper</em> in late July of this year made both of those possibilities much less likely. Because the not-so-subtly named album came with an equally unequivocal reality: The dude&apos;s here, and he can spit. </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.1">Dicky (whose real name is David Burd and who goes by many nicknames including Mr. Leftward-Sloping Penis, L-D, and Young Dick) made his name with a repertoire of well-produced, viral music videos, and a persona that&apos;s not so much a character as an exaggerated version of his own reality: a white, upper middle-class, Jewish, unkempt guy who raps about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rnFlQAvk8U">being white</a>, getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQmaEtUUPyE">too high</a>, and the insecurities of meeting a new girl&apos;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVEeZ7jjHyA">ex-boyfriend</a>. He markets himself as a sort of &quot;everyman,&quot; which, of course, is only true if you share the same descriptors.</p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.2">While <em>Professional Rapper</em> remains joke-heavy, the beats, the flow, and the featured talent&#x2014;Fetty Wap, Rich Homie Quan, T-Pain, Snoop Dogg&#x2014;are not the least bit laughable. The album hit No. 1 on Billboard&apos;s top rap charts, and doesn&apos;t so much ask as it does demand you accept that even though the words might be funny, the idea of Lil Dicky as a rapper is not. We caught up <a href="http://video.gq.com/watch/lil-dicky-on-the-case-for-fighting-with-your-girlfriend">with the man himself</a>, who told us, among other things, what it&apos;s like to buy weed after you go viral.        </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.3"><em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Fair to assume you&#x2019;ve always been a fan of hip-hop?</strong><br>Yeah, I&#x2019;ve always been totally enamored by hip-hop. I wouldn&#x2019;t say I liked it exclusively growing up. It was like that and alt-rock. But I always preferred it. It set a tone for everything I wanted to do in life.</p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>So it went beyond the phase every upper middle-class white kid goes through?</strong><br>It&#x2019;s the most self-expressive genre of music. From a raw emotion perspective. I don&#x2019;t listen to any other music at this point. Listening to the Goo Goo Dolls at this point ends up bumming me out.</p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>When did you start rapping yourself?</strong><br>Always done it very casually. I remember in fifth grade I did a history report on Alexander Pushkin via rap. </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>I know when you dropped your &quot;Ex-Boyfriend&quot; video, it got a million hits the first day, but was there a time before then that you realized you were pretty good at this rap thing?</strong><br>I kept the circle kind of small because I was so disinterested in my dreams being shot down. I didn&#x2019;t want to show people and have them be like, &#x201C;No shot. This is stupid.&#x201D; It took me two years to make the mix tape [&#x201C;So Hard,&#x201D; in April 2013]&#x2014;or a year and half&#x2014;and the videos. I just wanted to have hope alive the entire time. Because when you&#x2019;re creating, if you don&#x2019;t have maximum hope, you won&#x2019;t make the best product. I had two friends who said, yeah, you can rap, but I didn&#x2019;t know that their opinion actually held value. So to me, the first moment I actually did feel validation was the &#x201C;Ex-Boyfriend&#x201D; day, because that&#x2019;s like objective, quantifiable data. </p><div class="embed figure" data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.9"><figure class="embedded-video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RC-e5vs6NeY" height="" width=""></iframe></figure></div><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>What was the night before that day like?</strong><br>It took me so long to get it to a place where I was happy. You only get one first impression, and I was finally at a point where I knew the next day I was going to put it online. And the night before I genuinely started crying. </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.b"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&quot;I love how supportive my parents are.

Why?</strong><br>I had no idea what was going to happen. I just knew that I couldn&#x2019;t have made a better effort. It was just such a relief to know like, if you&#x2019;re not meant to do this, you&#x2019;re not meant to do it. But it won&#x2019;t be your fault. You totally did what you had to do and if it works, it works. I was just so happy the weight was off my shoulders. </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>What do your parents think?</strong><br>It&#x2019;s great and I love how supportive they are. But they know everything. There&#x2019;s not a single move I can make without them knowing about it. I&#x2019;ll tweet something like &#x201C;Just had sex,&#x201D; and then my mom thinks it&#x2019;s, like, cool [to discuss]. So I&#x2019;ve said so many times: If there&#x2019;s something you <em>think</em> I&#x2019;m not interested in talking with you about, odds are I&#x2019;m not. That&#x2019;s my whole shtick, like I&#x2019;m an open book. But <em>man</em>, do I not want to talk to my mom about certain things.</p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>You&#x2019;ve been asked a lot whether you&#x2019;re a comedian who raps, or a rapper who&#x2019;s funny. And I saw somewhere you said you feel like you&#x2019;re &#x201C;<a href="http://www.maxim.com/entertainment/music/article/lil-dicky-professional-rapper-2015-8">locked in a room playing a rapper</a>&#x201D;. Is that still the case after the success of this album?</strong> <br>It&#x2019;s not that I&#x2019;m playing a rapper. I definitely feel like I&#x2019;m a legitimate rapper. I just think that who I am, there&#x2019;s more to me than just being a rapper. For the last three years, I&#x2019;ve just been that rapper. I haven&#x2019;t even been like the friend to my friends. I haven&#x2019;t even been the guy who writes scripts. I think I have more to offer society from a public-facing perspective and [in my] personal life, than just simply being a rapper. </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Where is the line between David Burd and Lil Dicky?</strong><br>I think Lil Dicky is my rap spirit animal. He certainly wouldn&#x2019;t say anything that I didn&#x2019;t believe in. Both people like to joke around. I just think Lil Dicky is obviously the most unfiltered, uncensored version. He doesn&#x2019;t necessarily play by societal rules, whereas I&#x2019;m certainly in our society, and wouldn&#x2019;t be outlandish. I respect societal convention. Even a guy like Drake, he&#x2019;s got a rap spirit animal, and he probably raps different than he might act. I think everybody has their own inner rap spirit animal. </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Still have people who look past you because of your look?</strong><br>The other day I was doing a signing at CollegeFest in Boston. Some knew who I was and took pictures with me, and then other people saw people taking pictures and thought, &#x201C;This guy&#x2019;s famous.&#x201D; I have a hype man named Gata whose got dreads and tattoos on his face. Someone walked up to me, handed me the phone and said, &#x201C;Can you take a picture of me and Lil Dicky?&#x201D; I was like sure. They walk up to Gata and I take a picture. </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>You worked with some serious rappers on your album: Fetty Wap, T-Pain, Snoop Dogg. What&#x2019;s been the reception you&#x2019;ve had from guys in the rap game?</strong><br>Dude. Fantastic. I had an extreme concern about like&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t just wanna be a sideshow freak in rap. I have no interest in being that guy. I want to be in the game, being able to make songs with everybody. Like you said, it&#x2019;s easy to see a guy rapping comedically and not take him seriously as a rapper, but I think rappers especially realize how much effort and detail goes into my raps. Beyond that, I think everybody likes to laugh. And hip-hop, to me, used to be all about having fun, and not that it&#x2019;s gone away from that, but it&#x2019;s definitely gotten kind of serious and hyper masculine, less self-deprecation than I think used to be in the day. I guess what I&#x2019;ve found is that if you &#x201C;go hard&#x201D; and you&#x2019;re real, you&#x2019;re gonna get a lot of respect. So yeah, they love it. The rappers I&#x2019;ve met have been the most enthusiastic about what I&#x2019;m doing. </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Is that still nuts to you, that you&#x2019;re working with these guys?</strong><br>In the last six months, I&#x2019;ve felt like I&#x2019;m sitting in reality and looking at what&#x2019;s going on and feeling like I&#x2019;m living in a dream. Spending the day in Atlanta with Rich Homie Quan is like the most fun day ever. Two years ago if you told me that would be happening, I&#x2019;d literally be sitting in my cube daydreaming about such a thing. The other day I smoked weed for a video with Sarah Silverman. </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>What did your drug dealer say the first time he sold to you after you went viral?</strong><br>So this guy in San Francisco was selling me weed, and I think he always liked me because it was always an interesting deal. I would go in his car and sometimes he would have his daughter in there, who was very young. I ended up asking the daughter all these questions, and it felt like a very interesting dynamic. Like, &#x201C;How&#x2019;s your day going?&#x201D; as I hand her dad money. I&#x2019;d been doing it for like a year and half, and he somehow must have seen &quot;Ex-Boyfriend,&quot; and he texts me like, &#x201C;Dude, what the fuck? You&#x2019;re a rapper?!&#x201D; I think he felt like a sense of pride. I told him, Just so you know, my whole mixtape was created off of your weed. Your weed was the weed that inspired my rap career. </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Weed&#x2019;s a big part of your process, then?</strong><br>I used to smoke a lot less. I smoke more now than I ever have. I never really smoked in college even. Even now, I don&#x2019;t smoke until it&#x2019;s past 7 P.M. Like a glass of wine. And I try not to do it every day. I try to do it six days a week. It doesn&#x2019;t help write, but there&#x2019;s no way I can even start writing until I freestyle over a beat high and understand what my inner spirit rap animal, like how he sounds over it, what his attitude is. </p><div class="embed figure" data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.l"><figure class="embedded-video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ocGiulPm3IU" height="" width=""></iframe></figure></div><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Some of your album isn&#x2019;t typical Dicky laugh raps, though. That song &#x201C;Molly&#x201D; is pretty poignant&#x2014;that come from a real experience?</strong><br>Yeah. That&#x2019;s my ex-girlfriend. Like I said, the same way that I think I&#x2019;m more than a rapper, I think, as a rapper, I don&#x2019;t have just funny things to say. Being funny is my biggest differentiator and I think I&#x2019;d be a fool not to use that, and there&#x2019;s nothing I enjoy personally more than making a human being laugh. But then I also think I have a serious side to me. Like, I&#x2019;m totally emotionally vulnerable. I love love. There&#x2019;s nothing more&#x2014;being single to me is far less interesting to me than being in deep love. Not even close. I don&#x2019;t even think that&#x2019;s like a debate. So there&#x2019;s tons of different angles on my album. You couldn&#x2019;t listen to my album and not find one thing you liked. And I feel being diverse, not many rappers are that diverse. </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>Trying to get people to take you seriously, does that make you want to move away from comedy or show them comedy can win?</strong><br>Show them that comedy can win. It&#x2019;s a song like &quot;$ave Dat Money,&quot; with guys like Rich Homie Quan and Fetty Wap, where it sounds like a dope rap song. It&#x2019;s not just like a <em>Lonely Island</em> song and not gonna go on a hip hop radio station. No, it sounds like it <em>should</em> go on a hip-hop radio station.</p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>That&#x2019;s kind of like &#x201C;Lemme Freak,&#x201D; because that is a pretty bomb-ass song, even outside its comedic value.</strong><br>I love &#x201C;Lemme Freak.&#x201D; That hook is like an R. Kelly hook. It&#x2019;s the best the hook I&#x2019;ve ever written. </p><p data-reactid=".nekxkxu0ow.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>Quick: Favorite jerseys you own.</strong><br>Jesus Shuttlesworth on Lincoln.
