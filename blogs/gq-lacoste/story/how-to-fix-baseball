  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAt the outset of spring training, and on the heels of that annual dump of Super Bowl-pegged media reports chronicling the feeble sputterings of baseball as compared to the smothering reign of football, MLB announced some new initiatives. The league had a new commissioner, after all—for the first time in twenty-four years—and he was interested in reversing the atrophy of attendance, television viewership, and, most especially, interest among younger fans. One way to do this, MLB made clear with the initiatives, was to speed up the pace of play—anything to bring it down from the three-hours-and-two-minutes games took on average in 2014, which was sort of like watching the new King Kong 162 times over the course of eight months.\u000A\u000AYou might\u0027ve noticed the results if you\u0027ve been to the ballpark this season: Pitchers are on the clock—a physical ticker in the outfield—between innings (they have about two-and-a-half minutes at the change-over), batters aren\u0027t permitted to step out of the box (with a few exceptions, like a foul ball), and several other mechanisms of the game—the PA announcement of the next batter and his Top 40-scored stroll to the plate, for example—have been given an unofficial giddyup, as well.\u000A\u000AHere, at the quarter-pole of the season, we\u0027re already seeing significant results. Average game times have shaved off nine minutes, which is a rapid march in the right direction. A semi-related triumph: attendance is up slightly over last year (correlation not necessarily causation in this instance, but still). Personnel-wise, baseball seems healthier than it\u0027s been in recent years, too. There are real-deal young stars—your Trouts, Harveys, Stantons, Harpers—and the teams that\u0027ve stepped up as surprising early leaders are just beginning to hit a fiercely competitive stride. Most critically, MLB seems to understand it\u0027s got plenty going for it, that it doesn\u0027t need to be defensive about the product it\u0027s selling: Check out the new \u0022THIS\u0022 campaign, for example. Good job baseball!\u000A\u000AStill, the concerns are real. Baseball is doomed if it doesn\u0027t do more than girdle in ten minutes of game time. The slightly faster game is sort of like having your cough clear up, but knowing the lung cancer is still hanging around. Fans like me want more. We want radical. Baseball is still losing ground to perennial land-grabbers—the NFL, the FBS, whatever sports league Netflix decides to launch, etc—and it\u0027s got newcomers to the American market, like English soccer, breathing down its neck. I\u0027m one of the recent converts. Not because soccer is necessarily more exceptional than anything we\u0027ve had before, but because it\u0027s new and it\u0027s on when I\u0027m up and these guys are great. The 2014-2015 Premier League season wraps up Sunday, and while the title has already been decided (there are no playoffs—don\u0027t abort yet, you\u0027ll grow to respect the logic there!), plenty is at stake. Soccer has a few tricks to make things interesting even for teams that are tanking. And in baseball, where the season is endless and half the teams suck and the draft can\u0027t turn things around the way it can in other sports, this shouldn\u0027t be underestimated. It should be stolen! Baseball is long—the games are long, the season is long, the playoffs are (inexplicably) short. And baseball, if you\u0027re susceptible to the arguments, is boring as fuck. These are a few ways back from the brink.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A1) Boot the 3 worst teams down to Triple A\u000A\u000A It\u0027s funny to me, thinking back, that the patriotic adults of my childhood used to harp that soccer was a \u0022communist\u0022 sport. And yet soccer—not football, not basketball, not baseball— is the only sport that makes its ultimate judgments based on the numbers alone. Sink or swim: let the market of competition decide. Each season in the English Premier League, the three worst teams are \u0022relegated\u0022 and replaced by three teams from the second division. (The same basic model exists in almost every European league.) It doesn\u0027t matter if you\u0027re a perma-contender like Manchester United or Chelsea or Arsenal—if you finish the season in the bottom three, you\u0027re going down. (Whereas Major League Baseball will provide Water Wings for to the Miami Marlins until the end of days.) As morbid as this is for teams under threat of relegation, it sure keeps things interesting. Interesting enough, if appropriate in fact, to keep Indians fans in their seats at The Jake well after their shot at the playoffs has expired…\u000A\u000AImagine if baseball instituted relegation: Think how much more engaging a late-August Brewers game would be if their demotion to Triple A were on the line. (Yeah yeah, I know how farm systems work—that Triple A teams are subsidiaries of their parent Major League franchise, that they\u0027re not separate entities that sign players, make trades, and otherwise act autonomously. But play it out…) Had the rule been in effect during the 2014 season—that is if the three worst MLB teams had gone down and the three best Triple A teams had come up—Major League Baseball would\u0027ve dropped the Rockies, Diamondbacks, and Rangers. (The Rangers! Who won more regular-season games than any other team over the three years previous.) Which, of course, would be an enormous loss for fans in Denver, Phoenix, and Dallas. But think how much more interest you\u0027d have in the current season, with their replacements—the top 3 teams from Triple A—moving into their division slots. The Pawtucket Red Sox, the Omaha Storm Chasers, and the Reno Aces. No fan of sports isn\u0027t tuning in to watch their hometown team make its first trip to Omaha. Or, for that matter, to watch the $142 million Texas Rangers take their first bus ride away for a stand with the El Paso Chihuahuas. It\u0027s one of the great freshenings-up of soccer leagues worldwide—when each new season the giants of, say, Barcelona or Munich or Liverpool roll into town to play league fixtures in matchbox stadiums that seat fewer than fifteen thousand. Baseball could use the injection of newness: It\u0027s a gimmick, but at least it\u0027s a Jumbotron-free gimmick.\u000A\u000A2) Pump some steroids into the interleague play\u000A\u000A What watching this Premier League season made clear to me is that no matter how low teams like Newcastle and Sunderland could sink themselves, their northeast England home-and-away series (\u0022The Tyne-Wear Derby\u0022)—at moments when each team needed a lift most—provided a pair of the most thrilling matches league-wide all season. In baseball\u0027s 162-game marathon, there\u0027s not a lot to play for (or watch) in August when your team\u0027s out of postseason contention and there\u0027s not even a #1 prospect whom they can biff it for, like in the NFL. But an actual-stakes, week-long series between opposite-league teams like the Reds and Indians, with all of Ohio pride on the line?? IN!\u000A\u000AThe introduction of interleague play in 1997 was an undeniable initiative—just the sort of shake-up that brought fresh energy to baseball without compromising the stubborn \u0022integrity\u0022 of the truly important things: the 162-game season, the seven-game World Series, the batting pitcher in the National League. But while interleague play drew eyes and fans, I\u0027d always felt the games were more exhibition-y than heated. Then I saw the Dodgers and Angels play last August, when both teams were leading their divisions and stars on each squad (Kershaw and Trout) were in the MVP conversation. The game was as loud as the Dodgers\u0027 playoff games the season before, and the tickets were just as pricey, too. Here was a summer playoff vibe with something real-feeling on the line. Not just city pride, but something that could be nurtured into future historical consequence if the right steps were taken.\u000A\u000ARather than just the one three- or four-game series each year, each geographic NL-AL \u0022rivalry\u0022 should engage in a best-of-seven series right smack in the middle of summer, for one extra-hyped week, MLB-wide. A rivalry week played out 2-3-2, just like the LCS and World Series. A major, marketable event in the summer doldrums when baseball needs its greatest lift. An annual series with a trophy and everything. Seriously, give them a trophy! The trophy is important!\u000A\u000ABaseball\u0027s been close on this for years—they just need to impart fifty percent more significance on \u0022The Freeway Series\u0022 and \u0022The Subway Series\u0022 and whatever the sad, loose-geography, Manifest Destiny match-up between the Rockies and Mariners is called. (\u0022The Old Mountain and the Sea Series.\u0022)\u000A\u000A3) Build a national tournament that includes all levels of baseball\u000A\u000A The FA Cup is a 144-year-old soccer tournament in England that includes 945 teams, is conducted throughout the year, and begins competition with clubs from the 11th tier of English soccer. By the sixth round, when the top-tier Premier League teams are introduced to the competition, the tournament has been whittled down to a 64-team bracket. However, there\u0027s still a chance that a fourth-division team will be playing host to a Premier League team, the sort of matchup that can float a smaller club financially for years. (That kind of thing happened with fourth-division Cambridge United and Manchester United this winter.)\u000A\u000AImagine a baseball tournament like this one. Best of three games, beginning with Rookie league teams playing each other in April for the opportunity to face Single A teams in May, up through Double A, Triple A, and then eventually the introduction of MLB\u0027s 30 to the bracket, providing the opportunity for dream matchups such as: New York Yankees at Myrtle Beach Pelicans (Single A-advanced); Chicago Cubs at Akron RubberDucks (Double A); Boston Red Sox at Erie Seawolves (Double A). How cool would that be? Most of the time it\u0027d amount to Major League pros teeing off on young\u0027uns and journeymen, nine innings of b.p., with everyone in attendance heading home with a dinger like the fans at the Home Run Derby. But then every once in while, the cinderella Rubberducks knock out the Cubs at Wrigley. It\u0027s the sort of thing that leads SportsCenter. It\u0027s the sort of thing the Cubs exist to lose.",

spring training, and on the heels of that annual dump of Super Bowl-pegged media reports chronicling the feeble sputterings of baseball as compared to the smothering reign of football, MLB announced some new initiatives. The league had a new commissioner, after all&#x2014;for the first time in twenty-four years&#x2014;and he was interested in reversing the atrophy of attendance, television viewership, and, most especially, interest among younger fans. One way to do this, MLB made clear with the initiatives, was to speed up the pace of play&#x2014;anything to bring it down from the three-hours-and-two-minutes games took on average in 2014, which was sort of like watching the new <em>King Kong </em>162 times over the course of eight months.</p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.2">You might&#x2019;ve noticed the results if you&#x2019;ve been to the ballpark this season: Pitchers are on the clock&#x2014;a physical ticker in the outfield&#x2014;between innings (they have about two-and-a-half minutes at the change-over), batters aren&#x2019;t permitted to step out of the box (with a few exceptions, like a foul ball), and several other mechanisms of the game&#x2014;the PA announcement of the next batter and his Top 40-scored stroll to the plate, for example&#x2014;have been given an unofficial giddyup, as well.</p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.3">Here, at the quarter-pole of the season, we&#x2019;re already seeing significant results. Average game times have shaved off nine minutes, which is a rapid march in the right direction. A semi-related triumph: attendance is up slightly over last year (correlation not necessarily causation in this instance, but still). Personnel-wise, baseball seems healthier than it&#x2019;s been in recent years, too. There are real-deal young stars&#x2014;your Trouts, Harveys, Stantons, Harpers&#x2014;and the teams that&#x2019;ve stepped up as surprising early leaders are just beginning to hit a fiercely competitive stride. Most critically, MLB seems to understand it&#x2019;s got plenty going for it, that it doesn&#x2019;t need to be defensive about the product it&#x2019;s selling: <a href="http://m.mlb.com/video/v59814883/this-major-league-baseball-2015">Check out the new</a> &quot;THIS&quot; campaign, for example. Good job baseball!</p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.5">Still, the concerns are real. Baseball is doomed if it doesn&#x2019;t do more than girdle in ten minutes of game time. The slightly faster game is sort of like having your cough clear up, but knowing the lung cancer is still hanging around. Fans like me want more. We want <em>radical</em>. Baseball is still losing ground to perennial land-grabbers&#x2014;the NFL, the FBS, whatever sports league Netflix decides to launch, etc&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s got newcomers to the American market, like English soccer, breathing down its neck. I&#x2019;m one of the recent converts. Not because soccer is necessarily more exceptional than anything we&#x2019;ve had before, but because it&#x2019;s new and it&#x2019;s on when I&#x2019;m up and <a href="http://meninblazers.com">these guys are great</a>. The 2014-2015 Premier League season wraps up Sunday, and while the title has already been decided (there are no playoffs&#x2014;don&#x2019;t abort yet, you&#x2019;ll grow to respect the logic there!), plenty is at stake. Soccer has a few tricks to make things interesting even for teams that are tanking. And in baseball, where the season is endless and half the teams suck and the draft can&#x2019;t turn things around the way it can in other sports, this shouldn&#x2019;t be underestimated. It should be stolen! Baseball is long&#x2014;the games are long, the season is long, the playoffs are (inexplicably) short. And baseball, if you&#x2019;re susceptible to the arguments, is boring as fuck. These are a few ways back from the brink.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.6"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>1) Boot the 3 worst teams down to Triple A</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.8"> It&#x2019;s funny to me, thinking back, that the patriotic adults of my childhood used to harp that soccer was a &quot;communist&quot; sport. And yet soccer&#x2014;not football, not basketball, not baseball&#x2014; is the only sport that makes its ultimate judgments based on the numbers alone. Sink or swim: let the market of competition decide. Each season in the English Premier League, the three worst teams are &quot;relegated&quot; and replaced by three teams from the second division. (The same basic model exists in almost every European league.) It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you&#x2019;re a perma-contender like Manchester United or Chelsea or Arsenal&#x2014;if you finish the season in the bottom three, you&#x2019;re going down. (Whereas Major League Baseball will provide Water Wings for to the Miami Marlins until the end of days.) As morbid as this is for teams under threat of relegation, it sure keeps things interesting. Interesting enough, if appropriate in fact, to keep Indians fans in their seats at The Jake well after their shot at the playoffs has expired&#x2026;</p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.9">Imagine if baseball instituted relegation: Think how much more engaging a late-August Brewers game would be if their demotion to Triple A were on the line. (Yeah yeah, I know how farm systems work&#x2014;that Triple A teams are subsidiaries of their parent Major League franchise, that they&#x2019;re not separate entities that sign players, make trades, and otherwise act autonomously. But play it out&#x2026;) Had the rule been in effect during the 2014 season&#x2014;that is if the three worst MLB teams had gone down and the three best Triple A teams had come up&#x2014;Major League Baseball would&#x2019;ve dropped the Rockies, Diamondbacks, and Rangers. (The Rangers! Who won more regular-season games than any other team over the three years previous.) Which, of course, would be an enormous loss for fans in Denver, Phoenix, and Dallas. But think how much more interest you&#x2019;d have in the current season, with their replacements&#x2014;the top 3 teams from Triple A&#x2014;moving into their division slots. The Pawtucket Red Sox, the Omaha Storm Chasers, and the Reno Aces. No fan of sports isn&#x2019;t tuning in to watch their hometown team make its first trip to Omaha. Or, for that matter, to watch the $142 million Texas Rangers take their first bus ride away for a stand with the El Paso Chihuahuas. It&#x2019;s one of the great freshenings-up of soccer leagues worldwide&#x2014;when each new season the giants of, say, Barcelona or Munich or Liverpool roll into town to play league fixtures in matchbox stadiums that seat fewer than fifteen thousand. Baseball could use the injection of newness: It&#x2019;s a gimmick, but at least it&#x2019;s a Jumbotron-free gimmick.</p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>2) Pump some steroids into the interleague play</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.b"> What watching this Premier League season made clear to me is that no matter how low teams like Newcastle and Sunderland could sink themselves, their northeast England home-and-away series (&quot;The Tyne-Wear Derby&quot;)&#x2014;at moments when each team needed a lift most&#x2014;provided a pair of the most thrilling matches league-wide all season. In baseball&#x2019;s 162-game marathon, there&#x2019;s not a lot to play for (or watch) in August when your team&#x2019;s out of postseason contention and there&#x2019;s not even a #1 prospect whom they can biff it for, like in the NFL. But an actual-stakes, week-long series between opposite-league teams like the Reds and Indians, with all of Ohio pride on the line?? IN!</p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.c">The introduction of interleague play in 1997 was an undeniable initiative&#x2014;just the sort of shake-up that brought fresh energy to baseball without compromising the stubborn &quot;integrity&quot; of the truly important things: the 162-game season, the seven-game World Series, the batting pitcher in the National League. But while interleague play drew eyes and fans, I&#x2019;d always felt the games were more exhibition-y than heated. Then I saw the Dodgers and Angels play last August, when both teams were leading their divisions and stars on each squad (Kershaw and Trout) were in the MVP conversation. The game was as loud as the Dodgers&#x2019; playoff games the season before, and the tickets were just as pricey, too. Here was a summer playoff vibe with something real-feeling on the line. Not just city pride, but something that could be nurtured into future historical consequence if the right steps were taken.</p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.d">Rather than just the one three- or four-game series each year, each geographic NL-AL &quot;rivalry&quot; should engage in a best-of-seven series right smack in the middle of summer, for one extra-hyped week, MLB-wide. A rivalry week played out 2-3-2, just like the LCS and World Series. A major, marketable event in the summer doldrums when baseball needs its greatest lift. An annual series with a trophy and everything. Seriously, give them a trophy! The trophy is important!</p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.e">Baseball&#x2019;s been close on this for years&#x2014;they just need to impart fifty percent more significance on &quot;The Freeway Series&quot; and &quot;The Subway Series&quot; and whatever the sad, loose-geography, Manifest Destiny match-up between the Rockies and Mariners is called. (&quot;The Old Mountain and the Sea Series.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>3) Build a national tournament that includes all levels of baseball</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong> </strong>The FA Cup is a 144-year-old soccer tournament in England that includes 945 teams, is conducted throughout the year, and begins competition with clubs from the 11th tier of English soccer. By the sixth round, when the top-tier Premier League teams are introduced to the competition, the tournament has been whittled down to a 64-team bracket. However, there&#x2019;s still a chance that a fourth-division team will be playing host to a Premier League team, the sort of matchup that can float a smaller club financially for years. (That kind of thing happened with fourth-division Cambridge United and Manchester United this winter.)</p><p data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.4.h">Imagine a baseball tournament like this one. Best of three games, beginning with Rookie league teams playing each other in April for the opportunity to face Single A teams in May, up through Double A, Triple A, and then eventually the introduction of MLB&#x2019;s 30 to the bracket, providing the opportunity for dream matchups such as: New York Yankees at Myrtle Beach Pelicans (Single A-advanced); Chicago Cubs at Akron RubberDucks (Double A); Boston Red Sox at Erie Seawolves (Double A). How cool would that be? Most of the time it&#x2019;d amount to Major League pros teeing off on young&#x2019;uns and journeymen, nine innings of b.p., with everyone in attendance heading home with a dinger like the fans at the Home Run Derby. But then every once in while, the cinderella Rubberducks knock out the Cubs at Wrigley. It&#x2019;s the sort of thing that leads <em>SportsCenter</em>. It&#x2019;s the sort of thing the Cubs <em>exist </em>to lose.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".12w4j4xbxmo.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col
