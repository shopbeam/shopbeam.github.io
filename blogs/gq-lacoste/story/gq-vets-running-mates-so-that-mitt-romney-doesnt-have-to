  	    "articleBody": "GQ sent Jason Zengerle to Ted Frank, one of D.C.\u0027s top vetters, to find out if he had what it takes to be the next Sarah Palin. (He didn\u0027t.) We also asked Frank to discuss vetting issues for the Republican politicians most widely speculated to be in the running for Mitt Romney\u0027s vice presidential slot. The short answer, of course, is: vet every candidate for everything. But Romney\u0027s team will need to anticipate the opposition research the Obama campaign is engaging in, and, to that extent, will want to look especially closely at the following issues for the following candidates. Here\u0027s Ted Frank\u0027s take:\u000A\u000ATim Pawlenty, former governor, Minnesota\u000A\u000A The Risk Area: Attacks on Romney\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A The advantage of selecting a candidate who has already run for president is that they already have some experience with the scrutiny that comes with a national campaign. The disadvantage, in the YouTube age, is that a candidate such as Pawlenty has given dozens, perhaps hundreds, of recorded speeches where he might have spoken ill of Romney. This isn\u0027t fatal (recall the first George Bush complaining of Ronald Reagan\u0027s \u0022voodoo economics\u0022), but the campaign will need to be prepared for the inevitable viral videos. Romney already has the problem of threading the needle defending his Massachusetts healthcare plan while opposing to the federal Affordable Care Act; Pawlenty previously highlighted that contradiction. How will Pawlenty respond when pressed on his earlier comments? But the same things that make Pawlenty a good presidential candidate on paper—a smart economically conservative blue-state governor with legitimate evangelical Christian credentials, an inspiring biography, and a sharp-as-a-tack wife who\u0027d appeal to women voters—make him a good match for Romney\u0027s ticket. (Disclosure: I co-hosted a couple of Pawlenty fundraisers for his short-lived campaign, and donated enough money to pay for a handful of Ames straw-poll votes.)\u000A\u000AChris Christie, governor, New Jersey\u000A\u000A The Risk Area: Prosecutorial Deal Making\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A (1) As a U.S. Attorney, Christie negotiated at least one deferred prosecution agreement where a corporate defendant gave money to Christie\u0027s alma mater, Seton Hall, and avoided criminal prosecution. To date, there has been little fuss over this, perhaps because the Obama Department of Justice likes the flexibility of being able to engage in similar slush-fund arrangements that fund favored special-interest constituencies outside of the spotlight of legislative appropriations. Will the rules change if Christie becomes a national political figure and opponents\u000A\u000A (and journalists) look for scandals to create? (2) Mitch Daniels got lambasted by social conservatives in 2011 for calling for a \u0022truce\u0022 on social issues to focus on economic issues. But Christie, unlike Daniels, has actually proclaimed himself pro-choice. Will Christie\u0027s red-meat forthrightness be enough to assuage social conservatives that he can be on a ticket with Romney? Dick Cheney got a pass on gay rights but evangelicals were happy with Bush on the top of the ticket. Obama seems to have done Romney a big favor by picking two fights with the Christian right this year, which might permit Romney to lock down that vote without having to explicitly balance the ticket. (3) The obvious one is health issues: does the 300-pound-plus Christie have the physical stamina to run for vice-president? What do his doctors say?\u000A\u000AJohn Thune, Senator, South Dakota\u000A\u000A The Risk Area: Religious affiliations\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Like most Bush-era Republican Congressmen, Thune is going to have several budget-busting votes on his record that might make it awkward to attack President Obama\u0027s spending record. I would expect the Obama campaign to use surrogates to attack Thune\u0027s membership in \u0022The Family,\u0022 and, while the bipartisan Christian organization is almost certainly innocuous, a Romney-Thune communications team will want to be prepared for questions and investigations on the subject: Thune\u0027s stated \u0022Christian worldview\u0022 may be too aggressive and polarizing for independent voters. The selling point of Thune is that he can supposedly carry swing-state Iowa votes from his next-door South Dakota base; if the Romney team is making that political calculation, you would think a HBS-trained presidential candidate will want empirical proof of the proposition.\u000A\u000ARob Portman, Senator, Ohio\u000A\u000A The Risk Area: Ties to Bush 43\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Portman has never run in a heavily contested election, so will need closer vetting than one would expect given the length of his political career. As with Thune, vetters will need to be prepared to analyze potential attacks based on his Bush-era budget votes, especially because of Portman\u0027s role on critical committees and as head of OMB. Portman worked for D.C. lobbying firm Patton Boggs in his early career, and vetters will want to scrutinize his work there carefully. Romney has hinted that he wants a running mate with ecutive-branch experience: does the Bush administration Trade Representative count? Does Romney-Portman attract more swing-state Ohio votes than Romney-Pawlenty?\u000A\u000AMarco Rubio, Senator, Florida\u000A\u000A The Risk Area: Uproven policy chops\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A High risk, high reward. The rules changed after Sarah Palin, at least for Republicans. Palin got dragged through the cable-tv news mud because she knew details about Paul Revere that the media didn\u0027t, but a Joe Biden still gets a pass for blundering about Lebanon in a nationally televised debate. National Republican politicians without an Ivy-League pedigree are presumed by the media to be of subpar intelligence, and are going to be held to an unfair double standard that pre-Palin politicians weren\u0027t subjected to. The Romney team is going to want to know how Rubio would respond to a Palin-level of scrutiny on policy minutiae. Washington Post reporter Manuel Roig-Franzia\u0027s unauthorized biography is a several-hundred page vetting report (and opposition research guide) in and of itself.\u000A\u000ABobby Jindal, Governor, Louisiana\u000A\u000A The Risk Area: Faith-based extremism\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A He has surprising ties to Louisiana trial lawyers (butting heads\u000A\u000A with Louisiana Republicans and the Chamber of Commerce in defending certain abusive lawsuits) and vetters will want to look at those connections very closely lest he be embarrassed by a Dickie Scruggs-type scandal. (Scruggs was imprisoned on bribery convictions after a famously successful career waging class-action lawsuits.) If Jindal runs for national office, Democrats will publicize his authorship of a New Oord Review article about \u0022spiritual warfare\u0022 and attending an exorcism, as well as his signing an anti-evolution bill as governor.\u000A\u000ATed Frank, a lawyer in Washington, DC, was part of the team that vetted Sarah Palin for John McCain\u0027s presidential campaign in 2008.\u000A\u000ARead more on Death Race 2012\u000A\u000ARomney Officially Hates Athletes and Hard Work, We Assume\u000A\u000AHunger Reads: Michele Bachmann and the Truth about the Muslim Brotherhood, Bruce Springstein on the Recession and the Politics of the Dark Knight Rises\u000A\u000AToday\u0027s Political Firestorm: Bush is Going to Skip the Republican Convention\u000A\u000ARecollections From Another American Shooting\u000A\u000AFollow us @GQPolitics on Twitter for more updates on the campaign trail",

But Romney&#x2019;s team will need to anticipate the opposition research the Obama campaign is engaging in, and, to that extent, will want to look especially closely at the following issues for the following candidates.

The disadvantage, in the YouTube age, is that a candidate such as Pawlenty has given dozens, perhaps hundreds, of recorded speeches where he might have spoken ill of Romney. This isn&#x2019;t fatal (recall the first George Bush complaining of Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s &quot;voodoo economics&quot;), but the campaign will need to be prepared for the inevitable viral videos. Romney already has the problem of threading the needle defending his Massachusetts healthcare plan while opposing to the federal Affordable Care Act; Pawlenty previously highlighted that contradiction. How will Pawlenty respond when pressed on his earlier comments? But the same things that make Pawlenty a good presidential candidate on paper&#x2014;a smart economically conservative blue-state governor with legitimate evangelical Christian credentials, an inspiring biography, and a sharp-as-a-tack wife who&#x2019;d appeal to women voters&#x2014;make him a good match for Romney&#x2019;s ticket. (Disclosure: I co-hosted a couple of Pawlenty fundraisers for his short-lived campaign, and donated enough money to pay for a handful of Ames straw-poll votes.)</p><p data-reactid=".2cb0bxhhj4.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Chris Christie</strong>, governor, New Jersey</p><p data-reactid=".2cb0bxhhj4.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>The Risk Area:</strong> <em>Prosecutorial Deal Making</em></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2cb0bxhhj4.1.1.0.0.4.8"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fd763655c24c6c9552dd/master/w_806/news-politics-blogs-death-race-chris-christie.jpg" alt="news-politics-blogs-death-race-chris-christie.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgq-vets-running-mates-so-that-mitt-romney-doesnt-have-to&amp;t=news-politics-blogs-death-race-chris-christie.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgq-vets-running-mates-so-that-mitt-romney-doesnt-have-to&amp;t=news-politics-blogs-death-race-chris-christie.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgq-vets-running-mates-so-that-mitt-romney-doesnt-have-to&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fd763655c24c6c9552dd%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-politics-blogs-death-race-chris-christie.jpg&amp;description=news-politics-blogs-death-race-chris-christie.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgq-vets-running-mates-so-that-mitt-romney-doesnt-have-to&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fd763655c24c6c9552dd%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-politics-blogs-death-race-chris-christie.jpg&amp;description=news-politics-blogs-death-race-chris-christie.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".2cb0bxhhj4.1.1.0.0.4.9"> (1) As a U.S. Attorney, Christie negotiated at least one deferred prosecution agreement where a corporate defendant gave money to Christie&#x2019;s alma mater, Seton Hall, and avoided criminal prosecution. To date, there has been little fuss over this, perhaps because the Obama Department of Justice likes the flexibility of being able to engage in similar slush-fund arrangements that fund favored special-interest constituencies outside of the spotlight of legislative appropriations.

(2) Mitch Daniels got lambasted by social conservatives in 2011 for calling for a &quot;truce&quot; on social issues to focus on economic issues. But Christie, unlike Daniels, has actually proclaimed himself pro-choice. Will Christie&#x2019;s red-meat forthrightness be enough to assuage social conservatives that he can be on a ticket with Romney? Dick Cheney got a pass on gay rights but evangelicals were happy with Bush on the top of the ticket. Obama seems to have done Romney a big favor by picking two fights with the Christian right this year, which might permit Romney to lock down that vote without having to explicitly balance the ticket. (3) The obvious one is health issues: does the 300-pound-plus Christie have the physical stamina to run for vice-president?
