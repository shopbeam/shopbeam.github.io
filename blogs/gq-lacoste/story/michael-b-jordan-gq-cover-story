  	    "articleBody": "Photos: Michael B. Jordan: How to Dress Down for the Weekend\u000A\u000AMichael B. Jordan moved out to Los Angeles nine years ago, when he was 19, to see whether he could convert a teenage acting career into something that would last. But before then, he lived in a rough part of Newark, and he took plenty of what he learned there with him.  \u0022I\u0027m still very much an East Coast city boy,\u0022 he says. \u0022East Coast, growing up, going to Manhattan gives you a certain sense of just being able to make it. Hustle. Go-getter. Grind it out, you know.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s been working fine. In 2013, after a pair of teenage roles in the best of modern episodic TV, The Wire and Friday Night Lights, he was showered with acclaim for the way he commanded the screen in Fruitvale Station, re-creating the last day in the life of the 22-year-old Oscar Grant, inexplicably shot dead by a transit cop in San Francisco on New Year\u0027s Eve; this year he has already appeared as one of the reimagined Fantastic Four—a mark of his growing stature, however stuttering the end result—and he will soon play the title role in Creed, an unexpected and unexpectedly promising extension of the Rocky franchise.\u000A\u000AMeanwhile, nearly everything Michael B. Jordan does—in public, in the media—is done pretty smoothly, as though there are few things he prioritizes more than presenting an unruffled sheen and a dignified poise. Even if, sometimes, it seems as though this may come at the expense of releasing a more genuine Michael B. Jordan, one with a few rougher edges but also some sharper and deeper thoughts—the man you sense must surely exist when you watch him do what he does best on screen.\u000A\u000AI\u0027m not certain how much of that Michael B. Jordan he intended to show GQ. Maybe it was always his plan—he expressed excitement multiple times about being on the cover of this magazine (\u0022I\u0027m living the dream, man. This is crazy for me, bro! The cover of GQ was something I always wanted to do as a kid, bro—like, unreal\u0022), so perhaps he had also decided that this was the time to loosen things up a little. But I think it\u0027s also possible that circumstances tonight just led him in that direction. As it turns out, right from the very start.\u000A\u000A1. A Night in New York\u000A\u000AWe have arranged to meet for an eight o\u0027clock dinner at a well-regarded restaurant on Manhattan\u0027s Lower East Side, a place that neither of us has visited before but that was recommended to him by his manager. \u0022I\u0027m a foodie,\u0022 he\u0027ll tell me, \u0022so wherever the good food is...\u0022\u000A\u000AI arrive ﬁrst, and when I ask for the \u0022table-for-two for Jordan,\u0022 I am instantly led there. Jordan arrives about 15 minutes later, and I can see him talking to the greeter. And standing there. And standing there some more, a kind of ﬁxed expression on his face. He has to wait for a couple of minutes before, eventually, they lead him over. \u0022That\u0027s a whole other thing,\u0022 he says to me when I ask him what just happened, as if he\u0027s trying not to look as annoyed as he clearly is. As though he thinks whatever just took place fits all too neatly into a pattern that a successful black man has to endure as he traverses this world.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Just how annoyed Jordan actually is only becomes clear a little later, when he takes a sideways kind of retribution. It happens after he is brought his first tequila-and-cucumber cocktail. He has a first sip, then realizes this was not a fair taste test—he still has his chewing gum in his mouth. Removing it, he makes a swift decision, one that I only half-see. \u0022Right under the table,\u0022 he declares. A wide grin. \u0022Classy. I\u0027m classy, okay?\u0022\u000A\u000A A little surprised—and not wanting to get it wrong—I ask him whether he really did just stick his gum under there.\u000A\u000A\u0022Fuck, yeah, goddamn right I did,\u0022 he says. \u0022They made me wait outside for no reason. I\u0027m from north New Jersey, bro. I love real people, bro. I come from nothing. I come from sleeping in the kitchen with my family with the oven open to keep us warm during winter, you know? When you come from that background, all this extra stuff is just...extra stuff, you know? If somebody\u0027s not real with you, you can tell.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAs Michael B. Jordan makes clear, the career he is having is one that he is carefully steering. \u0022Looking back at it,\u0022 he says, \u0022I\u0027ve been doing it for so long—like, sixteen years—and it wasn\u0027t like I got too much too fast. It wasn\u0027t like I blew up overnight. I wasn\u0027t a child star. That wasn\u0027t what it was. It was just something that, you know, I grew into it, and I fell in love with it as it came along. And I kind of saw it for what it was. I\u0027m always good at seeing five, ten steps ahead. Like, really thinking ahead, you know? Reverse engineering whatever it is, you know.\u0022\u000A\u000A Which is to say that he has plans. A lot of plans. Almost from the moment he sits opposite me at this table, they flow out of him. He is not short of confidence, and he sees no reason why he should be. Right now he\u0027s concentrating on his production company. Films, of course. But animation, too: \u0022I\u0027m heavily into cartoons. Like my geek side, you know,\u0022 he says, detailing his manga devotion and how the genre favors underdog stories, \u0022so it kind of speaks to me.\u0022 And TV: \u0022smart television—that\u0027s where I come from, obviously... I also love telling true stories,\u0022 he says. \u0022I love telling the experience of a black male in America, but modern, not always having to go back to a period piece to remind people where we come from. It\u0027s more a modern sense of where we are today, and where we want to go in the future. So I try to choose projects somewhere around that space.\u0022\u000A\u000A You don\u0027t think that\u0027s being done well enough at the moment?\u000A\u000A \u0022Not to my liking. Not taking away from anybody that\u0027s done anything. I feel it\u0027s the next generation\u0027s job to pick up the baton. I feel like a lot of old filmmakers are victims of their own time period. In a way I feel like a certain racer can only take the race up to a certain leg, until they have to pass it off to the next generation to continue that race. I feel like, generationally speaking, there\u0027s a lot of racers that have taken it as far as they can. It\u0027s so interesting, man. There\u0027s no blueprint to what I want to do. You know, we got Leo, we got Tom Hanks, we got Brad Pitt, we got Ben Affleck—they always get the roles and the characters that, you know, fit the mold. When it comes to African-American characters, there\u0027s a huge gap between old school and new school.\u0022 He lists some of the former: \u0022It\u0027s Will and Denzel, Cheadle and Forest, Jamie...and there\u0027s a huge gap.\u0022 He leaves me to fill in what he is clearly implying—that there are not many people of Jordan\u0027s age making their mark—but when I say it, he nods.\u000A\u000A\u0022For sure,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000APlenty that he says on these subjects, on race and opportunity and modern Hollywood, makes plenty of sense. For instance, it\u0027s easy to imagine why he\u0027d want to find \u0022not just stereotypical roles of a black actor playing a thug or the drug dealer, doesn\u0027t know his mom, doesn\u0027t know his dad—you know, the same old, same old. I\u0027m not about stereotypes.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut this is just one of his plans. And, as will become clear, they often seem to contradict each other. This doesn\u0027t seem to bother him, and maybe it shouldn\u0027t over-bother us, either. The openhearted way of looking at it—and the way that seems most in keeping with his ebullient spirit—is that Michael B. Jordan feels too much possibility to be tied down to one path, one plan.  He has what you might call a generosity of ambition, one immune to the narrow-minded strictures of blunt logic. So in the same few minutes that he\u0027ll passionately discuss contemporary ways to depict African-American characters, he\u0027ll also declare, with equal conviction, \u0022I want to be part of that movement that blurs the line between white and black,\u0022 and tells me this: \u0022I told my team after I finished Chronicle [the successful low-budget sci-fi movie that first partnered him with Fantastic Four director Josh Trank] that I only want to go out for roles that were written for white characters. Me playing the role will make it what it is.\u0022\u000A\u000A I ask him whether his team saw that as realistic.\u000A\u000A \u0022I feel like,\u0022 he replies carefully, \u0022from an agency standpoint, they respected my ambition for what I was trying to do.\u0022\u000A\u000A So when you said that you only wanted to go out for roles written for white characters, what did your agent say?\u000A\u000A \u0022 ‘I hear you, and I understand.\u0027 The first time I sat down with multiple agents at the agency I told them, ‘Don\u0027t treat me like another actor that\u0027s coming through here just wanting to be famous. Understand the situation that I\u0027m in and the opportunities that are presented in front of me and the expectations that come with doing a film like Fruitvale Station moving forward.\u0027 You know, for my community, the African-American community, there was a certain expectation. You do a role that represents African-Americans, of Oscar Grant being wrongfully accused, wrongfully killed by the police, it\u0027s a certain expectation comes with it to be the one to speak out.\u0022\u000A\u000A Based on many other things Jordan says during our time together, it\u0027s clear that he doesn\u0027t expect this only-roles-written-for-white-actors mandate to be a blanket rule. In fact, the week before we met, Jordan announced plans to star in an adaptation of the memoir Just Mercy, about the African-American attorney Bryan Stevenson\u0027s fights on behalf of the innocent and the unfairly incarcerated. Perhaps a more accurate way of putting it is that he would like the same breadth of opportunities as the white actors he takes as career models. The two he has mentioned most often are Leonardo DiCaprio and Ryan Gosling. \u0022They made smart choices,\u0022 he says. \u0022They played people, not being ‘a white actor playing a person,\u0027 them playing a person. When I play a person or profession, it\u0027s black this, black that. It\u0027s obvious that I\u0027m black, but why do I have to be labeled as that?\u0022 And the best way to guarantee himself a better path, he says, is to be involved when the material is conceived: \u0022Instead of taking something conceptually written for a black guy, I want the stuff that was written for a guy.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe simple version of Michael B. Jordan\u0027s early years as a teenage actor is that he walked into two magical roles in two of the finest shows from the twenty-first-century TV renaissance: the young projects kid Wallace in the first season of The Wire and the conflicted quarterback Vince Howard, whose story wound through the center of Friday Night Lights\u0027 final two seasons. He\u0027ll tell it that way, too: \u0022I\u0027ve been blessed, bro. The things I\u0027ve done, I can\u0027t take credit for.\u0022\u000A\u000AFor The Wire, he originally auditioned for one of the other projects drug hustlers, Bodie, but he was told he was too young. \u0022Then they brought me back in for Wallace,\u0022 he says. As celebrated as The Wire is now, it\u0027s easy to forget that relatively few people noticed it—or Jordan\u0027s small but pivotal role within it—when HBO first aired it. \u0022At the moment it was just a show,\u0022 he remembers. But as its audience slowly grew, Jordan discovered that not only had he been part of something very special, but that his character had been particularly iconic. For instance, Oscar Grant\u0027s surviving family members instinctively called him Wallace for the first few days after they met. \u0022It was definitely something that broke the ice,\u0022 he recalls.\u000A\u000AEven though he was still playing a teenager in Friday Night Lights, it actually came seven years later, when he was 22, and it was in that show where you can really see Jordan coming of age as an actor. \u0022It helped me gain respect,\u0022 he says. \u0022It showed that I could handle a storyline. It\u0027s the first time I ever got that much meat. It taught me how to character-build. It didn\u0027t get any awards or nominations, but all the key people in the industry love that show, so when it came to me coming into auditions, it was tremendous. It was a very key show for me.\u0022\u000A\u000A So that\u0027s the simple version. In truth, though, The Wire and Friday Night Lights were the highlights of his early career. His real origin story is messier, with plenty of weirder, more discordant moments.\u000A\u000AHis first significant break came before The Wire, when he was 12, and it came courtesy of Bill Cosby, who cast him as a disruptive school kid on Cosby. Consequently, at a time when few people can find a good word for Cosby, Jordan still has some. \u0022First time I ever got a motivation as an actor, Bill Cosby gave me a thing, like a physical action—said, ‘You care about your hair, you love your hair, I want you to brush your hair throughout the entire thing and don\u0027t stop brushing it. Even when you\u0027re not talking, brush your hair. Okay?\u0027 It just gave me something else to think about, something to chew on moving forward. Like, ‘Okay, this worked alright, he knows what he\u0027s taking about.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AHis first significant movie role—also before The Wire—came in the Keanu Reeves–saves-the-inner-city baseball movie Hardball. In those days, Jordan would pick up acting and modeling jobs here and there, but he was far from committed. \u0022At that age, I didn\u0027t even know acting was what I wanted to do. I was just ‘I get to get out of school early, I get to go to New York and work on a set and get craft services—Skittles and candy and shit—it\u0027s awesome.\u0027 So young, bro. I was so young.\u0022\u000A\u000ALikewise, the job he went to straight after The Wire wasn\u0027t anything like Friday Night Lights—it was the daytime soap opera All My Children. He spent three years on the show, appearing in 52 episodes. \u0022I knew that it was a chess move,\u0022 he says. \u0022You work on a show like All My Children—we know what it is, but you\u0027re still able to grow outside of it. It\u0027s the perfect situation. I learned, I grew as an actor, I worked with professionals, I got paid.\u0022 He was also playing a part he knew he didn\u0027t want to repeat for his entire career: \u0022No dad, no mom, a fucking stereotypical black role in a soap opera. And I saw the stereotype, so moving forward I was like, ‘Nah, those are the roles I don\u0027t want to play.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AIt would take a while. Over the next few years he had guest-starring roles on an almost encyclopedic list of TV crime procedurals—CSI, Without a Trace, Cold Case, Burn Notice, Bones, Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent, Lie to Me—and it was very rare that he wasn\u0027t cast as a troubled young black man up to no good, a problem for someone probably much smarter and often much whiter to work out in the next 42 minutes.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ALast week, Jordan bought his first house. He\u0027ll be living alone for the first time, apart from a few months solo when he first arrived in Los Angeles as a teenager. Most recently he\u0027s been sharing a West Hollywood place with Justin Nappi, one of the producers on That Awkward Moment. \u0022You know, you can\u0027t have a roommate forever,\u0022 he says. \u0022I\u0027m 28. You know, just coming into my own.\u0022\u000A\u000A If it all goes to plan, Creed will only increase his public profile—something that he insists, for all his ambition, he\u0027s very uncomfortable with. \u0022I hate it,\u0022 he says. \u0022I\u0027m a quiet guy. I\u0027m very to myself. Don\u0027t like attention. I\u0027m getting a lot more now. I\u0027m extremely quiet, bro.\u0022 He echoes what he said earlier. \u0022All the extra shit is extra shit, you know.\u0022 And then, unbidden, he clarifies what he considers part of the extra shit. \u0022The females,\u0022 he says, \u0022they\u0027ll always be there. Like, honestly, bro. Oh, my God. Female-wise from now? I ain\u0027t got to do too much work. And it\u0027s weird, because I\u0027m the same guy. I haven\u0027t fucking changed, right? I don\u0027t look any different. I haven\u0027t done anything different.\u0022 He pauses, reconsiders this. \u0022Okay, maybe a blockbuster film.\u0022\u000A\u000A I think that makes a difference.\u000A\u000A \u0022So crazy, isn\u0027t it?\u0022\u000A\u000A So how do girls, or women, fit into your life right now?\u000A\u000A \u0022Um, I try and be focused. I told myself at a young age, once I kind of saw this momentum, that I would sacrifice all my twenties to my work. I\u0027m 28. I\u0027ve got a year and a half.\u0022\u000A\u000A And have you pretty much stuck to that?\u000A\u000A \u0022Yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000A So you\u0027ve never had serious...?\u000A\u000A He interrupts me. \u0022No. No.\u0022\u000A\u000A Is that a good thing?\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t know the answer to that. I\u0027m pretty sure the women won\u0027t say that\u0027s good, but for me it\u0027s like I can\u0027t have any regrets and I have to know that I gave everything I had to making my family okay. At the end of the day, that\u0027s all that matters to me is my family, bro. I come from nothing, so it\u0027s like my family, they came with me. That\u0027s all I care about. Couldn\u0027t give a fuck less about anything else. My mom, my dad, my sister, my brother—they\u0027re good, I\u0027m good. They\u0027re not good, I\u0027m not good. I put everything I had into everything, so once they\u0027re good I can start living a little. My mid-thirties I can live a little. And I\u0027m so okay with that. I\u0027m cool with that.\u0022\u000A\u000A I\u0027m guessing you might have come across a girl or two who didn\u0027t agree with this agenda.\u000A\u000A \u0022A lot of females that didn\u0027t agree with this agenda.\u0022\u000A\u000A How does that go?\u000A\u000A \u0022It goes like it goes. They want what they want, I tell them what I want. It doesn\u0027t quite work out that well. That\u0027s why I\u0027m by myself.\u0022\u000A\u000A Are you lonely?\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m not. I understand what females want and need, you know. I\u0027m good at that. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m the guy to give it to them right now. I\u0027m emotionally unavailable. Until I find something that\u0027s so undeniable that I can\u0027t help myself. Other than that, I need to work on making sure my mom is okay. That\u0027s all I care about, honestly. Females, they come and go.\u0022\u000A\u000A Do you think you\u0027ve ever been in love?\u000A\u000A He pauses. \u0022I\u0027ve probably been in infatuation.\u0022\u000A\u000A That\u0027s kind of a \u0022no.\u0022\u000A\u000A He nods. \u0022Kind of a ‘no.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s not to say that his life is free of more temporary distractions.\u000A\u000AThe week before we meet he posted a picture of himself on vacation in Capri. He shows me more photos on his phone: living on a boat, shimmering blue sea, offshore rocks with holes in them that remind him of The Goonies. He\u0027s not the only person in some of the photos. There\u0027s also someone he identifies as a girl from Milan. \u0022Just friends,\u0022 he says. \u0022Getting to know each other.\u0022\u000A\u000A Jordan was recently photographed leaving a Met Gala afterparty in New York at the same time as Kendall Jenner, and there was a brief ripple of stories wondering whether the two of them were dating, speculation which was dampened by \u0022sources\u0022 insisting that the photo was simply two people leaving a party at the same time by chance in the same frame. Nevertheless, it stirred up a little online squall, with those who presented themselves as Jordan\u0027s fans almost universally hostile to the idea.\u000A\u000A \u0022It\u0027s the world we live in,\u0022 says Jordan. \u0022They see white and black. I don\u0027t. Kendall\u0027s a friend of mine, you know. I don\u0027t know her, like, that well, but I know her enough. People\u0027s perspective on that is what it is. I don\u0027t fucking know. I don\u0027t live my life to make other people happy. It\u0027s so weird, though, right? A lot of black fans were feeling like, ‘Oh, my God, he should have been with a black woman\u0027 and that whole thing. I get it, but on the other hand it\u0027s, like, relax. You know—it\u0027s 2015. It\u0027s okay! People can like one another, not necessarily from the same history or culture or whatever the fuck it is. It\u0027s just the new world, you know what I mean?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAs Jordan graduated from TV to bigger and bigger movie roles, they all had one increasingly uncomfortable thing in common: He always ended up dying. His principal film roles between 2007 and 2013 were as follows: Blackout, Red Tails, Chronicle, and Fruitvale Station. He survives in none of them. During the promotional interviews for That Awkward Moment, he would often explain that one reason he took the role was that he didn\u0027t want to put his mother through another on-screen death. He\u0027d joke about it, but it bothered him. \u0022It\u0027s like, you know, stereotypes of black-guys-always-die-in-movies and all that shit. That didn\u0027t help any. My friends gave me a lot of shit about that. It was one of those things: ‘Stop dying in those movies, man.\u0027 It\u0027s like the running joke with horror movies—if the black guy\u0027s there, you know he\u0027s the first one gone.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat became another line drawn in the sand: \u0022I told [my agents] after Fruitvale, ‘I\u0027m not dying anymore—it\u0027s not happening,\u0027 \u0022 he says. \u0022I don\u0027t want people to get comfortable with seeing me die all the time.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe knows perfectly well that it\u0027s a rule he\u0027ll have to break, sooner or later.\u000A\u000A\u0022Of course. But I had to establish a run of films that I win, and I am on top. I ain\u0027t dying in Creed. I\u0027ll tell you that right now—spoiler alert! Adonis does not die, okay? Then, yeah, later on, down the line...you know, I want to play Sam Cooke one day.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAs we sit here, Jordan has three of those tequila-and-cucumber cocktails. I have no idea if they\u0027re crazy strong, but it takes me a while to realize that he\u0027s a little gone. Some of his answers confuse me, and it\u0027s only when I listen back to our conversation that I realize he has answered a completely different question to the one I have asked, or moved on to a totally different subject from the one we had been talking about. His pronouncements are also getting bolder and bigger, and sometimes with a slightly combative edge.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m not chasing anything,\u0022 he tells me. \u0022I\u0027m not chasing money, I\u0027m not chasing fame. I\u0027m out here in my own time doing things that matter to me, and what I feel like would matter to people. That\u0027s honestly it. I want to do roles that fucking people think about. I don\u0027t want people coming to me, ‘I want to pitch you because you\u0027re famous...oh, I see you on TV\u0027—that\u0027s fucking wack. I want to do roles that are like, ‘Oh, man, I have a cousin that went through that...I went through that, or I know what that feels like.\u0027 Like, it just means more.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s in town for a final promotional tour with the Fantastic Four cast before the movie\u0027s release. When I mention the mixed online chatter about the film and suggest it might be a little annoying to him, he replies: \u0022A little bit? Pretty fucking annoying, bro. Pretty fucking annoying.\u0022 He doesn\u0027t say too much more. \u0022I don\u0027t know how the movie\u0027s gonna turn out,\u0022 he says. \u0022I haven\u0027t seen it, but hopefully it\u0027s good.\u0022 He also remarks that with such a big movie, \u0022you have so many people that\u0027s involved in the making of this film, sometimes what you set out to do might not ultimately be the thing you end up doing.\u0022 But perhaps it\u0027s a little telltale—of some unease about Fantastic Four\u0027s prospects, and maybe also of how his conversation slips toward the end of our meal—that when I mention the movie the next day he will ask, a little anxiously, \u0022How much did I say last night?\u0022 (And then, at the end of the day, after we part, he calls me to make sure he hadn\u0027t said anything really bad about it. Which, for better or worse, he hadn\u0027t.)\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s also around this point in our evening that I ask him about Creed, and he starts to tell me about getting into shape. Tomorrow he will give me the sober version. But this is the week that another boxing movie, Southpaw, has just opened—a movie neither of us has mentioned up until this point—and this, somewhat surreally, is what Jordan says to me tonight as he faces me across the dinner table: \u0022Physically...fuck Jake, fuck Gyllenhaal, fuck all that shit...we want to come for him, look better than him...you know, I\u0027m competitive, so in my head it was, I\u0027ma work harder than all of them. Fuck that.\u0022\u000A\u000A A few minutes later, he pulls himself up. \u0022I\u0027m fading...I\u0027m kind of like...I\u0027m drunk, for sure,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AWe are meeting tomorrow at lunchtime, to head out to Newark, to see some of the world of his youth. He seems perfectly lucid talking about this: not showing off, but just gently suggesting that if we are to make this trip, it\u0027s best that I have some sense beforehand of what to expect.\u000A\u000A \u0022My home, growing up,\u0022 he explains, \u0022is hood as fuck.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A2. A Day in New Jersey\u000A\u000AIf Jordan remembers how much or how oddly he wilted toward the end of the previous evening, he doesn\u0027t mention it when we meet the next day. He\u0027s dressed up smartly, a thin black tie over a two-tone black-and-blue Oxford, and he\u0027s already co-hosted an event this morning for the charity Sport Matter. \u0022I\u0027m like, man, I don\u0027t know if he wants to see Newark,\u0022 he says to me. \u0022Newark, like, ain\u0027t nothing really.\u0022 He laughs. \u0022It\u0027s rough.\u0022\u000A\u000A As a hired car shuttles us out of the city toward Newark, he tells me about his parents. I ask how he is like each of them. \u0022My mom\u0027s super-compassionate, giving and selfless,\u0022 he says. \u0022I have my moments when I\u0027m like that. She\u0027s endured a lot—I\u0027m nowhere near as strong as my mom, but I think I get some of my strength from her, because she\u0027s been through a lot and she\u0027ll put a smile on your face and you\u0027ll never know. And I get my smile from her, for sure.\u0022\u000A\u000A As for his father, \u0022he\u0027s a thinker. He\u0027s in his head, he\u0027s quiet. When he speaks, you listen. And he knows how to sacrifice for the long term. Dad was a Marine, you know—he did what he had to do for his family. I\u0027m very much like that, to a T. My dad keeps a lot of his emotions to himself. I was like that a lot. I used to keep a lot of things in. Sometimes people can\u0027t really know what\u0027s going on with me because I\u0027m very internal.\u0022\u000A\u000A I ask Jordan whether that\u0027s a weakness or a strength; the very question seems to surprise him.\u000A\u000A\u0022I think it\u0027s a strength,\u0022 he answers firmly. \u0022I think I open up to the people I feel I need to open up to. And I think it\u0027s helped me a lot, going through this transition of me losing my privacy day by day. Of being able to handle that. Being able to navigate all these personalities and pitfalls.\u0022\u000A\u000A On Father\u0027s Day this year, Jordan posted a photograph of himself and his father on Instagram with the following caption: The guy who set the bar for me. You put your dreams on hold to help raise 3 kids. Beat my ass enough so I wouldnt get too far out of line but also gave me the lead way to stumble fall &amp; grow into the man I am today. Love you pop #FathersDay.\u000A\u000AThis in mind, I ask him whether his father was pretty strict, and he fills in some more details without prompting.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah,\u0022 he says. \u0022Yeah, growing up was definitely strict. Just wanting the best for us. Like, did I get beatings? Yes, I deserved them, you know what I\u0027m saying? I needed them. I can\u0027t imagine not being able to discipline your kids. Nowadays everybody: ‘Can\u0027t say this...can\u0027t touch a kid...child services...,\u0027 all that stuff. Of course it\u0027s a definite line between abusiveness and disciplining your kids. [But] look how I came out, you know. I came out just fine.\u0022 He laughs. \u0022Still get a little crazy...might be a little off, but whatever. I mean, I was a mischievous kid. I got into some mischief.\u0022\u000A\u000AAs we talk, we rise up on an elevated stretch of highway 78 over New Jersey, acres of parked cars below us.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s funny, I\u0027m looking at all these cars,\u0022 he says. \u0022You know, Jersey\u0027s like the car-thief capital of the world. For a really long time the reputation of Newark was stealing cars and all that stuff.\u0022 He offers one defensive clarification: \u0022Never stolen a car in my life.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut as for all that stuff...\u000A\u000A\u0022Driving, drifting, racing—that was a big part of my upbringing,\u0022 he says. \u0022You know. I love driving fast, and I love cars. Avenue P, the spot we used to go when we were kids...Thursday nights, it\u0027s a community. Kind of like The Fast and the Furious, man. That\u0027s pretty much what I used to do growing up. Hundred cars out there. Everybody out, you know. It\u0027s an industrial area. Listening to music. Racing cars back and forth. Some out there racing for pink slips, some out there just racing for fun. I burnt out a few clutches out there, and my dad come and get me. It was that, you know: ‘Argghhh, I know, I know, I know, I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m sorry...\u0027 \u0022 This was when he was working days on All My Children, which made it hard for his parents to draw lines. \u0022I\u0027m treated like an adult, this other life I live. I was making money, so if I burn out a clutch, I pay for it.\u0022\u000A\u000AI ask him whether he\u0027d win when he raced.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah!\u0022 he answers at first, but then adds, \u0022I mean, I lost a lot. I would never put my car up for a race—I\u0027m not that stupid. I just like the thrill of it. That\u0027s where I honed my driving skills. The risk would be once the cops came, because the cops would always come. It was just trying to figure out when and where they would come. The cops came, everybody was like roaches with the light on. Everybody scatters, you know. You just hop in somebody\u0027s car, meet up with your friends later. It was a rush, man. It was so much fun. That takes me back, bro.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe says that he used to time himself on the journey we just took, from the Holland Tunnel on the 78 freeway until his exit.\u000A\u000A\u0022My record is 11 minutes,\u0022 he says. \u0022Eleven minutes.\u0022 I look at him questioningly. \u0022I know,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AI ask what his top speed was.\u000A\u000A\u0022Probably about 127. 130. Maybe 127. I had a BMW 330 Ci.\u0022 He explains that he knew there were usually no cops in that stretch. \u0022No, I\u0027m just saying,\u0022 he adds. Meaning, I think, that he\u0027s not defending his teenage recklessness. \u0022No, I\u0027m talking about my rationale. As a kid, me thinking, Of course it\u0027s dangerous. You know what I\u0027m saying? But when I did do it...when I do speed, I take calculated risks.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWe\u0027re heading to the house where he grew up. He says his mother should be home. \u0022I wonder if she cooked,\u0022 he mutters. He decides to call ahead. \u0022You decent?\u0022 he asks her. It turns out that she\u0027s at Macy\u0027s, but says she\u0027ll head back.\u000A\u000AWhen we pull up outside, she\u0027s not yet there. Jordan points out where his grandmother used to live, next door, with her sister upstairs, and to his aunt\u0027s house nearby. He shows me the driveway where he chipped his tooth when he was slap-boxing with his neighbor and ran into the back of a parked car. And he shows me a bush in the corner of the tiny front garden that supplied the switches his grandmother used to hit him with when he misbehaved. \u0022I was a pyromaniac growing up,\u0022 Jordan says. \u0022Like the plastic shower curtains, sitting on the toilet, you get bored. I used to get incense and poke little holes in it. It was so dumb. ‘Bakari!\u0027 It was: ‘Go out there, get one of those branches right here, take off all the leaves.\u0027 And I used to come back with the wimpiest-looking wilted thing ever, and she\u0027s ‘No—no, get back out there and get another one.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AHe gestures up toward the attic room where he used to live. \u0022It was so hot up there, so hot it\u0027s crazy,\u0022 he says. But it was his. \u0022It was like my little sanctuary.\u0022 I ask him what he used to do up there. \u0022Play video games...study...freestyle,\u0022 he says, and laughs. \u0022I used to think that I was a rapper. Because I used to write poetry—that kind of turned into rapping.\u0022\u000A\u000AI ask him what his poems were about.\u000A\u000A\u0022A little bit of everything,\u0022 he says. \u0022I think it started out with me writing letters to girls. That was my thing. Letters turned to poetry.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd would they work?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah,\u0022 he says, grinning. \u0022Yeah, it worked. Yeah, man. Sometimes it didn\u0027t, you know, but a lot of times it did.\u0022\u000A\u000AIf the stories he told on the way out to Newark—the Fast and the Furious–style car antics, for instance—sounded just a little cocky, he strikes a very different tone now that he really is here, back in the world of his youth. He talks as though this is a place that requires his respect and his deference, one that might still have the power to reach out and cower him. Much of what he\u0027ll say to me here—which could sound on the page as someone talking up, and playing up to, the colorful and tough life he has left behind—is actually said in the polite and careful tone of a man explaining to an outsider like me exactly where I am and what I am seeing. Or, just as often, failing to see.\u000A\u000A\u0022This is a rough place to live and grow up,\u0022 he explains. \u0022This crazy-ass city. I had the protection of this street, because I had so many people on this block that knew me my entire life, that were family. A block this way, a block that way, you don\u0027t know. You know, I grew up piss-poor, you know what I\u0027m saying? I mean, I got into fights, all the normal kids\u0027 stuff. Got robbed at gunpoint. All that stuff. But on this street, it was kind of like a safe haven.\u0022 Even so. \u0022You can\u0027t live on a street the entire life. You can\u0027t stay on the block.\u0022 And out there, a few feet further from home, things were clearly more complicated. \u0022I always tried to use my best judgment,\u0022 Jordan says, \u0022even though sometimes my best judgment wasn\u0027t the best judgment. I had a lot of people looking out for me, making sure I didn\u0027t do too many dumb things... I was a good kid at heart. My mom and dad raised three intelligent kids, so we tried to do our best, make them proud.\u0022\u000A\u000AAfter a while, instead of waiting longer outside the house, we go for a drive \u0027round the neighborhood and the tour continues. As we hit one particular street, Clinton Place, which to the ignorant eye looks quite sweetly suburban, he says, \u0022This is rough over here... I mean, \u0027round where I\u0027m at, too, but it\u0027s just familiar because it\u0027s my rough. So many shootings, so many killings here.\u0022\u000A\u000AI ask whether he\u0027d actually be aware of all that when he was a kid.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah,\u0022 he says. \u0022I saw dead bodies, for sure. You know, you saw the crime scenes, for sure. Tons of car chases, cops right behind. Lots of fights, you know. Saw a lot.\u0022\u000A\u000AWe pass a court on the corner of Clinton Place and Chancellor. \u0022One of the most dangerous places to play basketball,\u0022 he says. \u0022At night, it\u0027s very exposed; it\u0027s on the corner. A crazy area, man.\u0022\u000A\u000AWe pick up chicken sandwiches from Jordan\u0027s favorite local spot and head back to his house; his mother, now home, greets us at the door. She apologizes for the mess; a slow process of packing has begun. Jordan\u0027s parents are soon moving out to Los Angeles. Jordan\u0027s father actually comes from California—South Central L.A.—and Jordan himself was born in Orange County, though they moved east when he was still a baby.\u000A\u000AA friend of his mother\u0027s, whom he calls Miss Rogers, is here, too. She asks him whether he\u0027s back to eating normal now. She\u0027s referring to the restrictive regime that got him into boxer shape for Creed.\u000A\u000A\u0022I should not be,\u0022 he says, unwrapping his sandwich. \u0022I should not be eating this right now. I\u0027m about to start back on that diet pretty soon. So I\u0027m not going to be eating anything.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ACreed was Fruitvale Station director Ryan Coogler\u0027s idea. The Rocky movies had a particular, personal weight in his life. Coogler was a serious athlete who became a college-football player. \u0022I started off young, with my dad coaching me, and before big games he would make me watch Rocky movies, specifically Rocky II,\u0022 he says. \u0022And he would always get really emotional in different parts of the movie—my pops, he\u0027s a tough guy from Oakland, and I\u0027d always kind of find it funny that my dad would tear up at certain parts of the movie. When I grew up, I learned that he would tear up because he used to watch that movie with his mom when she was sick—his mom passed away when he was 18. At the time when she was kind of at her worst, and she was bedridden, taking real difficult medication, Rocky II was on TV all the time.\u0022 Then, when Coogler was in film school and preparing to make Fruitvale Station, it was his father who got sick. It made Coogler think of a story based on the characters in the Rocky movies, but a generation on—a story where the man who was once a hero is no longer so strong. He and a friend wrote a script together based on the idea. \u0022It was almost like fan fiction, do you know what I mean?\u0022 he says. \u0022I never thought in a million years that I would go to Stallone and pitch this idea.\u0022\u000A\u000ANor was Stallone in any way looking for an idea like this, never mind from some unknown director with no track record. \u0022I thought the character and the journey had been put to bed at the end of Rocky Balboa,\u0022 says Stallone. \u0022I was very satisfied with it, and it had been a long journey to get that last one done. I thought, ‘OK, I\u0027ve completed my mission.\u0027 The more he presented the idea, the more I was opposed to it.\u0022\u000A\u000AStallone reconsidered after Fruitvale Station came out, and Coogler, despite all the other opportunities now coming his way, still wanted to make Creed. \u0022I realized to do this would be actually a very interesting social experiment as well as a cinematic experiment,\u0022 Stallone says now. \u0022Because it\u0027s being taken over by a whole new generation who is reinterpreting the character and perhaps even taking it on a completely different journey. And I was to be a passenger on that ride. And I said, ‘You know, maybe this is interesting that I\u0027ve evolved into the Burgess Meredith character, and it\u0027s now time for another generation to shine.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AStallone didn\u0027t know much about Jordan. \u0022I didn\u0027t know if he could actually take the hardship that I knew was coming. Because this is not a weekend or six-week gig—it\u0027s probably a ten-month situation where you literally live a monastic life, in a sense that you\u0027re in training constantly. You\u0027re eating four, five, six meals a day. Your mind is set in such a way that, if you\u0027re committed, you live this Spartan lifestyle, and then you begin to think like a fighter, you begin to move like a fighter.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Sly knew Mike could act—he had seen his work,\u0022 says Coogler, \u0022but he was concerned about his work ethic, you know what I mean? And, really, what Sly was asking was: ‘Is he gonna work as hard as I worked when I was doing these?\u0027 And I would guarantee him that once he met Mike, all his questions would be answered. I still have footage from the first day that they met, and you know, they just really, really, really got great chemistry together, man.\u0022\u000A\u000A At this point it might be instructive to hear their observations on first meeting each other.\u000A\u000AStallone on Jordan: \u0022The first impression is that you have this very complex individual whose waters run very deep. But on the surface he\u0027s approachable, affable, and relatable, which is very, very rare and has nothing to do with something that you could learn in any sort of acting class.\u0022\u000A\u000AJordan on Stallone: \u0022First meeting him, you never know what you\u0027re going to get yourself into; then you realize he\u0027s smart as fuck. He\u0027s dope.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AJordan and I eat our takeout on foldout tables in the living room, next to a giant old TV.  \u0022I took him to my spot,\u0022 he explains to his mother and her friend. The chicken sandwiches, too big for any normal person to finish, have French fries folded into them. \u0022I didn\u0027t tell you about that one,\u0022 he says. \u0022Out here in Jersey, that\u0027s kind of how we do it.\u0022\u000A\u000AAs we eat, he explains to his mother and her friend all the travel he has coming up to promote Fantastic Four.\u000A\u000A\u0022We\u0027re proud of you,\u0022 Miss Rogers says. \u0022Really very proud of you. Just keep it straight and narrow.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I am,\u0022 he says. \u0022I am. I am.\u0022 And he explains that we\u0027ve just been talking in the car about the things that have changed in the wake of the new attention he\u0027s receiving. \u0022Like people coming out of the woodwork and all of a sudden just treating me different,\u0022 he says. \u0022Not in a negative way, but just like...it is what it is, I guess.\u0022 His mother shares her own version—the calls from people she hasn\u0027t heard from for a long time, which share all the usual friendly catch-up information until she hears: \u0022Oh, yeah, just one more thing...\u0022 \u0022You know, whatever they want to ask you,\u0022 she says. \u0022Whether it be a picture or a ticket to a premiere or whatever. You don\u0027t see it coming sometimes.\u0022 And then she passes on the most recent request, for him to be grand marshal at a local homecoming.\u000A\u000ASoon he says his goodbyes, and we head back toward the city.\u000A\u000AThere is no journey like the journey back to where we come from, because as it reminds us who we were, it also makes us see who we no longer are. Being back in Newark, and being asked about it, has clearly thrown up plenty of thoughts for Jordan—about the good and the bad of his childhood; about paths taken and paths avoided, and perhaps about how thin and precarious the line is between them sometimes—and on the ride back into the city, his tone is reflective.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s a lot of memories, man,\u0022 he says. \u0022So many things that are familiar. So it\u0027s not sad. It\u0027s just like a nostalgic feeling of just being around things you remember. It\u0027s like that: This is where I came from, this is what built me, this is where I used to live, this is my home, this is me. And then there\u0027s a feeling of guilt, a little bit—still having my parents live there, me living in L.A., them still being not yet where I need them to be or where I want them to be. That guilt of leaving the hood but your mom and dad are still there, but just for right now. You\u0027ve seen the house—we\u0027re in the process of packing up and leaving. So I know they\u0027re coming out eventually. But that\u0027s how I feel right now. It\u0027s always weird when I leave my mom—I always have a sense of sadness.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd then there\u0027s the more general, complicated feelings that come with achievement and escape and empathy.\u000A\u000A\u0022After getting out, seeing so much of the world and seeing different things, and you come back to where you started,\u0022 he says, \u0022sometimes you want that for everybody, to be able to have that perspective. So it\u0027s a lot of different emotions.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe knows that all of this might so easily have never happened. His acting career was triggered more or less by happenstance when the receptionist at his mother\u0027s doctor—she has lupus—mentioned that young Michael should try modeling. He\u0027d never thought of anything like that. If he had an ambition, it was to play basketball. I ask what he thought about this new idea at the time. \u0022 ‘Whatever...okay...cool,\u0027 \u0022 he says. \u0022I didn\u0027t give a fuck. As a kid at 11, 12, you don\u0027t think that far ahead. I didn\u0027t care about that shit. I had no perspective.\u0022\u000A\u000AI tell him that some kids at that age really want it.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah,\u0022 he says, \u0022but I didn\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t something I ever wanted. Acting to me was something so foreign. Didn\u0027t give a fuck. It was so out of my hands, bro.\u0022 To this day, he\u0027s never taken acting classes. \u0022I didn\u0027t come from that background, you know what I\u0027m saying? I just like being real. As real as I think you can be. I\u0027ve been doing it since I was 11 years old, and it\u0027s like I gradually grew into it.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThis summer\u0027s new version of Fantastic Four, of course, will turn out to be a textbook debacle. After a flurry of reviews that range from disappointed to savagely dismissive, the director Josh Trank posts a tweet before the opening weekend that effectively disowns the version of the movie being released. The ensuing grosses are massively below even the most pessimistic predictions, and multiple stories begin leaking about just how messy and conflicted the film\u0027s production was. Few of these stories directly involve Jordan, whose performance in the film somehow exists on its periphery, as though the few moments when he is allowed to speak freely are excerpted random snatches from a bigger, edgier performance delivered with an attitude that this movie had no room for. Though it won\u0027t have delivered him the international box-office credentials he hoped for, I doubt Fantastic Four\u0027s failure will damage him too much—albeit for the sad and surprising reason that, for the first time in his movie career, it is quite hard to remember that he was even in it.\u000A\u000AJust from Creed\u0027s trailer, it\u0027s clear that particular problem won\u0027t repeat itself there. And it\u0027s hard to imagine Michael B. Jordan allowing it to happen again anytime soon.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHis father is called Michael Jordan, and it was obvious to his father that his first son should carry the same name. This was 1987, and his father was aware that someone else of this name was becoming popular. \u0022He didn\u0027t care,\u0022 his son tells me. And to put the decision in perspective, the other Jordan was still four years away from his first championship—\u0022He wasn\u0027t the legend, the icon, yet,\u0022 Michael B. points out—so his father had no reason to know what was coming or how much weight would be attached to that name. As for Michael B.\u0027s mother, when her son was profiled as an up-and-coming actor by a local New Jersey newspaper at the age of 17, she was asked her thoughts about her son\u0027s name. Her reply? \u0022After 89 hours of labor, I told my husband, ‘I don\u0027t care what you name him.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A Jordan realized when he was young that his name came with a lot of baggage. \u0022It made me competitive, you know,\u0022 he says. \u0022I played basketball a lot growing up, and people used to tease and joke about the name. Until I got on the court, and then they didn\u0027t talk as much. So that was definitely something that pushed me, moving forward.\u0022\u000A\u000A For his first acting roles, he appeared in the credits simply as \u0022Michael Jordan,\u0022 until the Screen Actors Guild pointed out that this name was already taken. (He says the story that he was mistakenly sent a $45,000 Space Jam check is untrue, but that he did get sent some tax forms intended for his namesake.) He needed to find something different. \u0022Small fish, big pond,\u0022 he says. \u0022MJ won that battle.\u0022\u000A\u000A At first he considered using his middle name, Bakari, as a surname to become Michael Bakari. \u0022My family calls me Bakari,\u0022 he points out. \u0022Nobody calls me Michael. Anybody that really knows me—like, knows me knows me—they don\u0027t call me Michael. My mom, even when I\u0027m in trouble, it\u0027s ‘Bakari!\u0027 My spiritual name—in Swahili it means ‘of noble promise.\u0027 That\u0027s why names are very powerful, you know. Bakari\u0027s something that\u0027s been said to me all my life by the people I really care about and respect.\u0022 But in the end he decided that just a hint of Bakari was enough; that\u0027s how he became Michael B. Jordan.\u000A\u000A He now sees this whole issue as one more lever that has propelled him to where he is now.\u000A\u000A\u0022I used to not like my name,\u0022 he says. \u0022I used to want to change it. But it gave me a chip on my shoulder—a healthy chip to want to have my own purpose. I want people to think of me when they hear my name. Not, you know, the other guy.\u0022\u000A\u000AChris Heath is a GQ correspondent.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARecommended Reading:Michael B.

Jordan: How to Dress Down for the Weekend</a></strong></p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.1">Michael B. Jordan moved out to Los Angeles nine years ago, when he was 19, to see whether he could convert a teenage acting career into something that would last. But before then, he lived in a rough part of Newark, and he took plenty of what he learned there with him.  &#x201C;I&#x2019;m still very much an East Coast city boy,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;East Coast, growing up, going to Manhattan gives you a certain sense of just being able to make it. Hustle. Go-getter. Grind it out, you know.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2">It&#x2019;s been working fine. In 2013, after a pair of teenage roles in the best of modern episodic TV, <em>The Wire</em> and <em>Friday Night Lights</em>, he was <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/michael-b-jordan-men-of-the-year-breakout">showered with acclaim</a> for the way he commanded the screen in <em>Fruitvale Station</em>, re-creating the last day in the life of the 22-year-old Oscar Grant, inexplicably shot dead by a transit cop in San Francisco on New Year&#x2019;s Eve; this year he has already appeared as one of the reimagined Fantastic Four&#x2014;a mark of his growing stature, however stuttering the end result&#x2014;and he will soon play the title role in <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/rocky-spinoff-creed-trailer"><em>Creed</em></a>, an unexpected and unexpectedly promising extension of the <em>Rocky</em> franchise.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3">Meanwhile, nearly everything Michael B. Jordan does&#x2014;in public, in the media&#x2014;is done pretty smoothly, as though there are few things he prioritizes more than presenting an unruffled sheen and a dignified poise. Even if, sometimes, it seems as though this may come at the expense of releasing a more genuine Michael B. Jordan, one with a few rougher edges but also some sharper and deeper thoughts&#x2014;the man you sense must surely exist when you watch him do what he does best on screen.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.5">I&#x2019;m not certain how much of that Michael B. Jordan he intended to show <em>GQ</em>. Maybe it was always his plan&#x2014;he expressed excitement multiple times about being on the cover of this magazine (&#x201C;I&#x2019;m living the dream, man. This is crazy for me, bro! The cover of <em>GQ</em> was something I always wanted to do as a kid, bro&#x2014;like, unreal&#x201D;), so perhaps he had also decided that this was the time to loosen things up a little. But I think it&#x2019;s also possible that circumstances tonight just led him in that direction. As it turns out, right from the very start.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>1. A Night in New York</strong></p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.7">We have arranged to meet for an eight o&#x2019;clock dinner at a well-regarded restaurant on Manhattan&#x2019;s Lower East Side, a place that neither of us has visited before but that was recommended to him by his manager. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a foodie,&#x201D; he&#x2019;ll tell me, &#x201C;so wherever the good food is...&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.8">I arrive &#xFB01;rst, and when I ask for the &#x201C;table-for-two for Jordan,&#x201D; I am instantly led there. Jordan arrives about 15 minutes later, and I can see him talking to the greeter. And standing there. And standing there some more, a kind of &#xFB01;xed expression on his face. He has to wait for a couple of minutes before, eventually, they lead him over. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s a whole other thing,&#x201D; he says to me when I ask him what just happened, as if he&#x2019;s trying not to look as annoyed as he clearly is. As though he thinks whatever just took place fits all too neatly into a pattern that a successful black man has to endure as he traverses this world.</p><div class="embed cnevideo" data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.9"><figure class="embedded-video" data-src="//player.cnevids.com/embedjs/5601655361646d1f0d000007/51097beb8ef9aff9f5000005.js" data-type="cnevideo"><script src="http://player.cnevids.com/embedjs/5601655361646d1f0d000007/51097beb8ef9aff9f5000005.js"></script></figure></div><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.a"> Just how annoyed Jordan actually is only becomes clear a little later, when he takes a sideways kind of retribution. It happens after he is brought his first tequila-and-cucumber cocktail. He has a first sip, then realizes this was not a fair taste test&#x2014;he still has his chewing gum in his mouth. Removing it, he makes a swift decision, one that I only half-see. &#x201C;Right under the table,&#x201D; he declares. A wide grin. &#x201C;Classy. I&#x2019;m classy, okay?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.b"> A little surprised&#x2014;and not wanting to get it wrong&#x2014;I ask him whether he really did just stick his gum under there.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.c">&#x201C;Fuck, yeah, goddamn right I did,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;They made me wait outside for no reason. I&#x2019;m from north New Jersey, bro. I love real people, bro. I come from nothing. I come from sleeping in the kitchen with my family with the oven open to keep us warm during winter, you know? When you come from that background, all this extra stuff is just...<em>extra stuff</em>, you know? If somebody&#x2019;s not real with you, you can tell.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.d"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.e">As Michael B. Jordan makes clear, the career he is having is one that he is carefully steering. &#x201C;Looking back at it,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been doing it for so long&#x2014;like, sixteen years&#x2014;and it wasn&#x2019;t like I got too much too fast. It wasn&#x2019;t like I blew up overnight. I wasn&#x2019;t a child star. That wasn&#x2019;t what it was. It was just something that, you know, I grew into it, and I fell in love with it as it came along. And I kind of saw it for what it was. I&#x2019;m always good at seeing five, ten steps ahead. Like, really thinking ahead, you know? Reverse engineering whatever it is, you know.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.f"> Which is to say that he has plans. A lot of plans. Almost from the moment he sits opposite me at this table, they flow out of him. He is not short of confidence, and he sees no reason why he should be. Right now he&#x2019;s concentrating on his production company. Films, of course. But animation, too: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m heavily into cartoons. Like my geek side, you know,&#x201D; he says, detailing his manga devotion and how the genre favors underdog stories, &#x201C;so it kind of speaks to me.&#x201D; And TV: &#x201C;smart television&#x2014;that&#x2019;s where I come from, obviously... I also love telling true stories,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I love telling the experience of a black male in America, but <em>modern</em>, not always having to go back to a period piece to remind people where we come from. It&#x2019;s more a modern sense of where we are today, and where we want to go in the future. So I try to choose projects somewhere around that space.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.g"> <em>You don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s being done well enough at the moment?</em></p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.h"> &#x201C;Not to my liking. Not taking away from anybody that&#x2019;s done anything. I feel it&#x2019;s the next generation&#x2019;s job to pick up the baton. I feel like a lot of old filmmakers are victims of their own time period. In a way I feel like a certain racer can only take the race up to a certain leg, until they have to pass it off to the next generation to continue that race. I feel like, generationally speaking, there&#x2019;s a lot of racers that have taken it as far as they can. It&#x2019;s so interesting, man. There&#x2019;s no blueprint to what I want to do. You know, we got Leo, we got Tom Hanks, we got Brad Pitt, we got Ben Affleck&#x2014;they always get the roles and the characters that, you know, fit the mold. When it comes to African-American characters, there&#x2019;s a huge gap between old school and new school.&#x201D; He lists some of the former: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s Will and Denzel, Cheadle and Forest, Jamie...and there&#x2019;s a huge gap.&#x201D; He leaves me to fill in what he is clearly implying&#x2014;that there are not many people of Jordan&#x2019;s age making their mark&#x2014;but when I say it, he nods.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.i">&#x201C;For sure,&#x201D; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.j">Plenty that he says on these subjects, on race and opportunity and modern Hollywood, makes plenty of sense. For instance, it&#x2019;s easy to imagine why he&#x2019;d want to find &#x201C;not just stereotypical roles of a black actor playing a thug or the drug dealer, doesn&#x2019;t know his mom, doesn&#x2019;t know his dad&#x2014;you know, the same old, same old. I&#x2019;m not about stereotypes.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.k">But this is just one of his plans. And, as will become clear, they often seem to contradict each other. This doesn&#x2019;t seem to bother him, and maybe it shouldn&#x2019;t over-bother us, either. The openhearted way of looking at it&#x2014;and the way that seems most in keeping with his ebullient spirit&#x2014;is that Michael B. Jordan feels too much possibility to be tied down to one path, one plan.  He has what you might call a generosity of ambition, one immune to the narrow-minded strictures of blunt logic. So in the same few minutes that he&#x2019;ll passionately discuss contemporary ways to depict African-American characters, he&#x2019;ll also declare, with equal conviction, &#x201C;I want to be part of that movement that blurs the line between white and black,&#x201D; and tells me this: &#x201C;I told my team after I finished <em>Chronicle</em> [the successful low-budget sci-fi movie that first partnered him with <em>Fantastic Four</em> director Josh Trank] that I only want to go out for roles that were written for white characters. Me playing the role will make it what it is.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.l"> I ask him whether his team saw that as realistic.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.m"> &#x201C;I feel like,&#x201D; he replies carefully, &#x201C;from an agency standpoint, they respected my ambition for what I was trying to do.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.n"> <em>So when you said that you only wanted to go out for roles written for white characters, what did your agent say?</em></p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.o"> &#x201C; &#x2018;I hear you, and I understand.&#x2019; The first time I sat down with multiple agents at the agency I told them, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t treat me like another actor that&#x2019;s coming through here just wanting to be famous. Understand the situation that I&#x2019;m in and the opportunities that are presented in front of me and the expectations that come with doing a film like <em>Fruitvale Station</em> moving forward.&#x2019; You know, for my community, the African-American community, there was a certain expectation. You do a role that represents African-Americans, of Oscar Grant being wrongfully accused, wrongfully killed by the police, it&#x2019;s a certain expectation comes with it to be the one to speak out.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.p"> Based on many other things Jordan says during our time together, it&#x2019;s clear that he doesn&#x2019;t expect this only-roles-written-for-white-actors mandate to be a blanket rule. In fact, the week before we met, Jordan announced plans to star in an adaptation of the memoir <em>Just Mercy</em>, about the African-American attorney Bryan Stevenson&#x2019;s fights on behalf of the innocent and the unfairly incarcerated. Perhaps a more accurate way of putting it is that he would like the same breadth of opportunities as the white actors he takes as career models. The two he has mentioned most often are Leonardo DiCaprio and Ryan Gosling. &#x201C;They made smart choices,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;They played people, not being &#x2018;a white actor playing a person,&#x2019; them playing a person. When I play a person or profession, it&#x2019;s black this, black that. It&#x2019;s obvious that I&#x2019;m black, but why do I have to be labeled as that?&#x201D; And the best way to guarantee himself a better path, he says, is to be involved when the material is conceived: &#x201C;Instead of taking something conceptually written for a black guy, I want the stuff that was written for a <em>guy</em>.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.q"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.r">The simple version of Michael B. Jordan&#x2019;s early years as a teenage actor is that he walked into two magical roles in two of the finest shows from the twenty-first-century TV renaissance: the young projects kid Wallace in the first season of <em>The Wire</em> and the conflicted quarterback Vince Howard, whose story wound through the center of <em>Friday Night Lights&#x2019;</em> final two seasons. He&#x2019;ll tell it that way, too: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been blessed, bro. The things I&#x2019;ve done, I can&#x2019;t take credit for.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.s">For <em>The Wire</em>, he originally auditioned for one of the other projects drug hustlers, Bodie, but he was told he was too young. &#x201C;Then they brought me back in for Wallace,&#x201D; he says. As celebrated as <em>The Wire</em> is now, it&#x2019;s easy to forget that relatively few people noticed it&#x2014;or Jordan&#x2019;s small but pivotal role within it&#x2014;when HBO first aired it. &#x201C;At the moment it was just a show,&#x201D; he remembers. But as its audience slowly grew, Jordan discovered that not only had he been part of something very special, but that his character had been particularly iconic. For instance, Oscar Grant&#x2019;s surviving family members instinctively called him Wallace for the first few days after they met. &#x201C;It was definitely something that broke the ice,&#x201D; he recalls.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.t">Even though he was still playing a teenager in <em>Friday Night Lights</em>, it actually came seven years later, when he was 22, and it was in that show where you can really see Jordan coming of age as an actor. &#x201C;It helped me gain respect,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;It showed that I could handle a storyline. It&#x2019;s the first time I ever got that much meat. It taught me how to character-build. It didn&#x2019;t get any awards or nominations, but all the key people in the industry love that show, so when it came to me coming into auditions, it was tremendous. It was a very key show for me.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.u"> So that&#x2019;s the simple version. In truth, though, <em>The Wire</em> and <em>Friday Night Lights</em> were the highlights of his early career. His real origin story is messier, with plenty of weirder, more discordant moments.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.v">His first significant break came before <em>The Wire,</em> when he was 12, and it came courtesy of Bill Cosby, who cast him as a disruptive school kid on <em>Cosby</em>. Consequently, at a time when few people can find a good word for Cosby, Jordan still has some. &#x201C;First time I ever got a motivation as an actor, Bill Cosby gave me a thing, like a physical action&#x2014;said, &#x2018;You care about your hair, you love your hair, I want you to brush your hair throughout the entire thing and don&#x2019;t stop brushing it. Even when you&#x2019;re not talking, brush your hair. Okay?&#x2019; It just gave me something else to think about, something to chew on moving forward. Like, &#x2018;Okay, this worked alright, he knows what he&#x2019;s taking about.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.w">His first significant movie role&#x2014;also before <em>The Wire</em>&#x2014;came in the Keanu Reeves&#x2013;saves-the-inner-city baseball movie <em>Hardball</em>. In those days, Jordan would pick up acting and modeling jobs here and there, but he was far from committed. &#x201C;At that age, I didn&#x2019;t even know acting was what I wanted to do. I was just &#x2018;I get to get out of school early, I get to go to New York and work on a set and get craft services&#x2014;Skittles and candy and shit&#x2014;it&#x2019;s awesome.&#x2019; So young, bro. I was so young.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.x">Likewise, the job he went to straight after <em>The Wire</em> wasn&#x2019;t anything like <em>Friday Night Lights</em>&#x2014;it was the daytime soap opera <em>All My Children</em>. He spent three years on the show, appearing in 52 episodes. &#x201C;I knew that it was a chess move,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;You work on a show like <em>All My Children</em>&#x2014;we know what it is, but you&#x2019;re still able to grow outside of it. It&#x2019;s the perfect situation. I learned, I grew as an actor, I worked with professionals, I got paid.&#x201D; He was also playing a part he knew he didn&#x2019;t want to repeat for his entire career: &#x201C;No dad, no mom, a fucking stereotypical black role in a soap opera. And I saw the stereotype, so moving forward I was like, &#x2018;Nah, those are the roles I don&#x2019;t want to play.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.y">It would take a while. Over the next few years he had guest-starring roles on an almost encyclopedic list of TV crime procedurals&#x2014;<em>CSI</em>, <em>Without a Trace</em>, <em>Cold Case</em>, <em>Burn Notice</em>, <em>Bones</em>, <em>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</em>, <em>Lie to Me&#x2014;</em>and it was very rare that he wasn&#x2019;t cast as a troubled young black man up to no good, a problem for someone probably much smarter and often much whiter to work out in the next 42 minutes.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.z"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.10">Last week, Jordan bought his first house. He&#x2019;ll be living alone for the first time, apart from a few months solo when he first arrived in Los Angeles as a teenager. Most recently he&#x2019;s been sharing a West Hollywood place with Justin Nappi, one of the producers on <em>That Awkward Moment</em>. &#x201C;You know, you can&#x2019;t have a roommate forever,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m 28. You know, just coming into my own.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.11"> If it all goes to plan, <em>Creed</em> will only increase his public profile&#x2014;something that he insists, for all his ambition, he&#x2019;s very uncomfortable with. &#x201C;I hate it,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a quiet guy. I&#x2019;m very to myself. Don&#x2019;t like attention. I&#x2019;m getting a lot more now. I&#x2019;m extremely quiet, bro.&#x201D; He echoes what he said earlier. &#x201C;All the extra shit is extra shit, you know.&#x201D; And then, unbidden, he clarifies what he considers part of the extra shit. &#x201C;The females,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;they&#x2019;ll always be there. Like, honestly, bro. Oh, my God. Female-wise from now? I ain&#x2019;t got to do too much work. And it&#x2019;s weird, because I&#x2019;m the same guy. I haven&#x2019;t fucking changed, right? I don&#x2019;t look any different. I haven&#x2019;t done anything different.&#x201D; He pauses, reconsiders this. &#x201C;Okay, maybe a blockbuster film.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.12"> <em>I think that makes a difference.</em></p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.13"> &#x201C;So crazy, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.14"> <em>So how do girls, or women, fit into your life right now?</em></p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.15"> &#x201C;Um, I try and be focused.

I&#x2019;m pretty sure the women won&#x2019;t say that&#x2019;s good, but for me it&#x2019;s like I can&#x2019;t have any regrets and I have to know that I gave everything I had to making my family okay. At the end of the day, that&#x2019;s all that matters to me is my family, bro. I come from nothing, so it&#x2019;s like my family, they came with me. That&#x2019;s all I care about. Couldn&#x2019;t give a fuck less about anything else. My mom, my dad, my sister, my brother&#x2014;they&#x2019;re good, I&#x2019;m good. They&#x2019;re not good, I&#x2019;m not good. I put everything I had into everything, so once they&#x2019;re good I can start living a little. My mid-thirties I can live a little. And I&#x2019;m so okay with that.

Until I find something that&#x2019;s so undeniable that I can&#x2019;t help myself. Other than that, I need to work on making sure my mom is okay. That&#x2019;s all I care about, honestly.

He shows me more photos on his phone: living on a boat, shimmering blue sea, offshore rocks with holes in them that remind him of <em>The Goonies</em>. He&#x2019;s not the only person in some of the photos. There&#x2019;s also someone he identifies as a girl from Milan. &#x201C;Just friends,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Getting to know each other.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.1o"> Jordan was recently photographed leaving a Met Gala afterparty in New York at the same time as Kendall Jenner, and there was a brief ripple of stories wondering whether the two of them were dating, speculation which was dampened by &#x201C;sources&#x201D; insisting that the photo was simply two people leaving a party at the same time by chance in the same frame. Nevertheless, it stirred up a little online squall, with those who presented themselves as Jordan&#x2019;s fans almost universally hostile to the idea.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.1p"> &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the world we live in,&#x201D; says Jordan. &#x201C;They see white and black. I don&#x2019;t. Kendall&#x2019;s a friend of mine, you know. I don&#x2019;t know her, like, that well, but I know her enough. People&#x2019;s perspective on that is what it is. I don&#x2019;t fucking know. I don&#x2019;t live my life to make other people happy. It&#x2019;s so weird, though, right? A lot of black fans were feeling like, &#x2018;Oh, my God, he should have been with a black woman&#x2019; and that whole thing. I get it, but on the other hand it&#x2019;s, like, relax. You know&#x2014;it&#x2019;s 2015. It&#x2019;s okay! People can like one another, not necessarily from the same history or culture or whatever the fuck it is.

His principal film roles between 2007 and 2013 were as follows: <em>Blackout</em>, <em>Red Tails</em>, <em>Chronicle</em>, and <em>Fruitvale Station</em>. He survives in none of them. During the promotional interviews for <em>That Awkward Moment</em>, he would often explain that one reason he took the role was that he didn&#x2019;t want to put his mother through another on-screen death. He&#x2019;d joke about it, but it bothered him. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s like, you know, stereotypes of black-guys-always-die-in-movies and all that shit. That didn&#x2019;t help any. My friends gave me a lot of shit about that. It was one of those things: &#x2018;Stop dying in those movies, man.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s like the running joke with horror movies&#x2014;if the black guy&#x2019;s there, you know he&#x2019;s the first one gone.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.1s">That became another line drawn in the sand: &#x201C;I told [my agents] after <em>Fruitvale,</em> &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not dying anymore&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not happening,&#x2019; &#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want people to get comfortable with seeing me die all the time.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.1t">He knows perfectly well that it&#x2019;s a rule he&#x2019;ll have to break, sooner or later.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.1u">&#x201C;Of course. But I had to establish a run of films that I win, and I am on top. I ain&#x2019;t dying in <em>Creed</em>. I&#x2019;ll tell you that right now&#x2014;spoiler alert! Adonis does not die, okay?

I have no idea if they&#x2019;re crazy strong, but it takes me a while to realize that he&#x2019;s a little gone. Some of his answers confuse me, and it&#x2019;s only when I listen back to our conversation that I realize he has answered a completely different question to the one I have asked, or moved on to a totally different subject from the one we had been talking about. His pronouncements are also getting bolder and bigger, and sometimes with a slightly combative edge.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.1x">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not chasing anything,&#x201D; he tells me. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not chasing money, I&#x2019;m not chasing fame. I&#x2019;m out here in my own time doing things that matter to me, and what I feel like would matter to people. That&#x2019;s honestly it. I want to do roles that fucking people think about. I don&#x2019;t want people coming to me, &#x2018;I want to pitch you because you&#x2019;re famous...oh, I see you on TV&#x2019;&#x2014;that&#x2019;s fucking wack. I want to do roles that are like, &#x2018;Oh, man, I have a cousin that went through that...I went through that, or I know what that feels like.&#x2019; Like, it just means more.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.1y">He&#x2019;s in town for a final promotional tour with the <em>Fantastic Four</em> cast before the movie&#x2019;s release. When I mention the mixed online chatter about the film and suggest it might be a little annoying to him, he replies: &#x201C;A little bit? Pretty fucking annoying, bro. Pretty fucking annoying.&#x201D; He doesn&#x2019;t say too much more. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know how the movie&#x2019;s gonna turn out,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I haven&#x2019;t seen it, but hopefully it&#x2019;s good.&#x201D; He also remarks that with such a big movie, &#x201C;you have so many people that&#x2019;s involved in the making of this film, sometimes what you set out to do might not ultimately be the thing you end up doing.&#x201D; But perhaps it&#x2019;s a little telltale&#x2014;of some unease about <em>Fantastic Four</em>&#x2019;s prospects, and maybe also of how his conversation slips toward the end of our meal&#x2014;that when I mention the movie the next day he will ask, a little anxiously, &#x201C;How much did I say last night?&#x201D; (And then, at the end of the day, after we part, he calls me to make sure he hadn&#x2019;t said anything really bad about it. Which, for better or worse, he hadn&#x2019;t.)</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.1z">It&#x2019;s also around this point in our evening that I ask him about <em>Creed</em>, and he starts to tell me about getting into shape.

But this is the week that another boxing movie, <em>Southpaw</em>, has just opened&#x2014;a movie neither of us has mentioned up until this point&#x2014;and this, somewhat surreally, is what Jordan says to me tonight as he faces me across the dinner table: &#x201C;Physically...fuck Jake, fuck Gyllenhaal, fuck all that shit...we want to come for him, look better than him...you know, I&#x2019;m competitive, so in my head it was, I&#x2019;ma work harder than all of them.

He&#x2019;s dressed up smartly, a thin black tie over a two-tone black-and-blue Oxford, and he&#x2019;s already co-hosted an event this morning for the charity Sport Matter. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m like, man, I don&#x2019;t know if he wants to see Newark,&#x201D; he says to me. &#x201C;Newark, like, ain&#x2019;t nothing really.&#x201D; He laughs. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s rough.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.26"> As a hired car shuttles us out of the city toward Newark, he tells me about his parents. I ask how he is like each of them. &#x201C;My mom&#x2019;s super-compassionate, giving and selfless,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I have my moments when I&#x2019;m like that. She&#x2019;s endured a lot&#x2014;I&#x2019;m nowhere near as strong as my mom, but I think I get some of my strength from her, because she&#x2019;s been through a lot and she&#x2019;ll put a smile on your face and you&#x2019;ll never know. And I get my smile from her, for sure.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.27"> As for his father, &#x201C;he&#x2019;s a thinker. He&#x2019;s in his head, he&#x2019;s quiet. When he speaks, you listen. And he knows how to sacrifice for the long term. Dad was a Marine, you know&#x2014;he did what he had to do for his family. I&#x2019;m very much like that, to a T. My dad keeps a lot of his emotions to himself. I was like that a lot. I used to keep a lot of things in. Sometimes people can&#x2019;t really know what&#x2019;s going on with me because I&#x2019;m very internal.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.28"> I ask Jordan whether that&#x2019;s a weakness or a strength; the very question seems to surprise him.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.29">&#x201C;I think it&#x2019;s a strength,&#x201D; he answers firmly. &#x201C;I think I open up to the people I feel I need to open up to. And I think it&#x2019;s helped me a lot, going through this transition of me losing my privacy day by day. Of being able to handle that. Being able to navigate all these personalities and pitfalls.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2a"> On Father&#x2019;s Day this year, Jordan posted a photograph of himself and his father on Instagram with the following caption: <em>The guy who set the bar for me.

Just wanting the best for us. Like, did I get beatings? Yes, I deserved them, you know what I&#x2019;m saying? I needed them. I can&#x2019;t imagine not being able to discipline your kids. Nowadays everybody: &#x2018;Can&#x2019;t say this...can&#x2019;t touch a kid...child services...,&#x2019; all that stuff. Of course it&#x2019;s a definite line between abusiveness and disciplining your kids. [But] look how I came out, you know. I came out just fine.&#x201D; He laughs. &#x201C;Still get a little crazy...might be a little off, but whatever. I mean, I was a mischievous kid. I got into some mischief.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2d">As we talk, we rise up on an elevated stretch of highway 78 over New Jersey, acres of parked cars below us.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2e">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s funny, I&#x2019;m looking at all these cars,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;You know, Jersey&#x2019;s like the car-thief capital of the world. For a really long time the reputation of Newark was stealing cars and all that stuff.&#x201D; He offers one defensive clarification: &#x201C;Never stolen a car in my life.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2f">But as for <em>all that stuff</em>...</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2g">&#x201C;Driving, drifting, racing&#x2014;that was a big part of my upbringing,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;You know. I love driving fast, and I love cars. Avenue P, the spot we used to go when we were kids...Thursday nights, it&#x2019;s a community. Kind of like <em>The Fast and the Furious</em>, man. That&#x2019;s pretty much what I used to do growing up. Hundred cars out there. Everybody out, you know. It&#x2019;s an industrial area. Listening to music. Racing cars back and forth. Some out there racing for pink slips, some out there just racing for fun. I burnt out a few clutches out there, and my dad come and get me. It was that, you know: &#x2018;Argghhh, I know, I know, I know, I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2019;m sorry...&#x2019; &#x201D; This was when he was working days on <em>All My Children</em>, which made it hard for his parents to draw lines. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m treated like an adult, this other life I live. I was making money, so if I burn out a clutch, I pay for it.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2h">I ask him whether he&#x2019;d win when he raced.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2i">&#x201C;Yeah!&#x201D; he answers at first, but then adds, &#x201C;I mean, I lost a lot. I would never put my car up for a race&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not that stupid. I just like the thrill of it. That&#x2019;s where I honed my driving skills. The risk would be once the cops came, because the cops would always come. It was just trying to figure out when and where they would come. The cops came, everybody was like roaches with the light on. Everybody scatters, you know. You just hop in somebody&#x2019;s car, meet up with your friends later. It was a rush, man. It was so much fun. That takes me back, bro.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2j">He says that he used to time himself on the journey we just took, from the Holland Tunnel on the 78 freeway until his exit.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2k">&#x201C;My record is 11 minutes,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Eleven minutes.&#x201D; I look at him questioningly. &#x201C;I know,&#x201D; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2l">I ask what his top speed was.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2m">&#x201C;Probably about 127. 130. Maybe 127. I had a BMW 330 Ci.&#x201D; He explains that he knew there were usually no cops in that stretch. &#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m just saying,&#x201D; he adds. Meaning, I think, that he&#x2019;s not defending his teenage recklessness. &#x201C;No, I&#x2019;m talking about my rationale. As a kid, me thinking, Of course it&#x2019;s dangerous. You know what I&#x2019;m saying?

He says his mother should be home. &#x201C;I wonder if she cooked,&#x201D; he mutters. He decides to call ahead. &#x201C;You decent?&#x201D; he asks her. It turns out that she&#x2019;s at Macy&#x2019;s, but says she&#x2019;ll head back.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2p">When we pull up outside, she&#x2019;s not yet there. Jordan points out where his grandmother used to live, next door, with her sister upstairs, and to his aunt&#x2019;s house nearby. He shows me the driveway where he chipped his tooth when he was slap-boxing with his neighbor and ran into the back of a parked car. And he shows me a bush in the corner of the tiny front garden that supplied the switches his grandmother used to hit him with when he misbehaved. &#x201C;I was a pyromaniac growing up,&#x201D; Jordan says. &#x201C;Like the plastic shower curtains, sitting on the toilet, you get bored. I used to get incense and poke little holes in it. It was so dumb. &#x2018;Bakari!&#x2019; It was: &#x2018;Go out there, get one of those branches right here, take off all the leaves.&#x2019; And I used to come back with the wimpiest-looking wilted thing ever, and she&#x2019;s &#x2018;No&#x2014;no, get back out there and get another one.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2q">He gestures up toward the attic room where he used to live. &#x201C;It was so hot up there, so hot it&#x2019;s crazy,&#x201D; he says. But it was his. &#x201C;It was like my little sanctuary.&#x201D; I ask him what he used to do up there. &#x201C;Play video games...study...freestyle,&#x201D; he says, and laughs. &#x201C;I used to think that I was a rapper. Because I used to write poetry&#x2014;that kind of turned into rapping.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2r">I ask him what his poems were about.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2s">&#x201C;A little bit of everything,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I think it started out with me writing letters to girls. That was my thing. Letters turned to poetry.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2t"><em>And would they work?</em></p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2u">&#x201C;Yeah,&#x201D; he says, grinning. &#x201C;Yeah, it worked.

Sometimes it didn&#x2019;t, you know, but a lot of times it did.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2v">If the stories he told on the way out to Newark&#x2014;the <em>Fast and the Furious</em>&#x2013;style car antics, for instance&#x2014;sounded just a little cocky, he strikes a very different tone now that he really is here, back in the world of his youth. He talks as though this is a place that requires his respect and his deference, one that might still have the power to reach out and cower him. Much of what he&#x2019;ll say to me here&#x2014;which could sound on the page as someone talking up, and playing up to, the colorful and tough life he has left behind&#x2014;is actually said in the polite and careful tone of a man explaining to an outsider like me exactly where I am and what I am seeing. Or, just as often, failing to see.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2w">&#x201C;This is a rough place to live and grow up,&#x201D; he explains. &#x201C;This crazy-ass city. I had the protection of this street, because I had so many people on this block that knew me my entire life, that were family. A block this way, a block that way, you don&#x2019;t know. You know, I grew up piss-poor, you know what I&#x2019;m saying? I mean, I got into fights, all the normal kids&#x2019; stuff. Got robbed at gunpoint. All that stuff. But on this street, it was kind of like a safe haven.&#x201D; Even so. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t live on a street the entire life. You can&#x2019;t stay on the block.&#x201D; And out there, a few feet further from home, things were clearly more complicated. &#x201C;I always tried to use my best judgment,&#x201D; Jordan says, &#x201C;even though sometimes my best judgment wasn&#x2019;t the best judgment. I had a lot of people looking out for me, making sure I didn&#x2019;t do too many dumb things... I was a good kid at heart. My mom and dad raised three intelligent kids, so we tried to do our best, make them proud.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2x">After a while, instead of waiting longer outside the house, we go for a drive &#x2019;round the neighborhood and the tour continues. As we hit one particular street, Clinton Place, which to the ignorant eye looks quite sweetly suburban, he says, &#x201C;This is rough over here... I mean, &#x2019;round where I&#x2019;m at, too, but it&#x2019;s just familiar because it&#x2019;s my rough. So many shootings, so many killings here.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2y">I ask whether he&#x2019;d actually be aware of all that when he was a kid.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.2z">&#x201C;Yeah,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I saw dead bodies, for sure. You know, you saw the crime scenes, for sure. Tons of car chases, cops right behind. Lots of fights, you know. Saw a lot.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.30">We pass a court on the corner of Clinton Place and Chancellor. &#x201C;One of the most dangerous places to play basketball,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;At night, it&#x2019;s very exposed; it&#x2019;s on the corner. A crazy area, man.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.31">We pick up chicken sandwiches from Jordan&#x2019;s favorite local spot and head back to his house; his mother, now home, greets us at the door. She apologizes for the mess; a slow process of packing has begun. Jordan&#x2019;s parents are soon moving out to Los Angeles. Jordan&#x2019;s father actually comes from California&#x2014;South Central L.A.&#x2014;and Jordan himself was born in Orange County, though they moved east when he was still a baby.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.32">A friend of his mother&#x2019;s, whom he calls Miss Rogers, is here, too. She asks him whether he&#x2019;s back to eating normal now. She&#x2019;s referring to the restrictive regime that got him into boxer shape for <em>Creed.</em></p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.33">&#x201C;I should not be,&#x201D; he says, unwrapping his sandwich. &#x201C;I should not be eating this right now. I&#x2019;m about to start back on that diet pretty soon. So I&#x2019;m not going to be eating anything.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.34"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.35"><em>Creed</em> was <em>Fruitvale Station</em> director Ryan Coogler&#x2019;s idea. The <em>Rocky</em> movies had a particular, personal weight in his life. Coogler was a serious athlete who became a college-football player. &#x201C;I started off young, with my dad coaching me, and before big games he would make me watch <em>Rocky</em> movies, specifically <em>Rocky II</em>,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;And he would always get really emotional in different parts of the movie&#x2014;my pops, he&#x2019;s a tough guy from Oakland, and I&#x2019;d always kind of find it funny that my dad would tear up at certain parts of the movie. When I grew up, I learned that he would tear up because he used to watch that movie with his mom when she was sick&#x2014;his mom passed away when he was 18. At the time when she was kind of at her worst, and she was bedridden, taking real difficult medication, <em>Rocky II</em> was on TV all the time.&#x201D; Then, when Coogler was in film school and preparing to make <em>Fruitvale Station</em>, it was his father who got sick. It made Coogler think of a story based on the characters in the <em>Rocky</em> movies, but a generation on&#x2014;a story where the man who was once a hero is no longer so strong. He and a friend wrote a script together based on the idea. &#x201C;It was almost like fan fiction, do you know what I mean?&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I never thought in a million years that I would go to Stallone and pitch this idea.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.36">Nor was Stallone in any way looking for an idea like this, never mind from some unknown director with no track record. &#x201C;I thought the character and the journey had been put to bed at the end of <em>Rocky Balboa</em>,&#x201D; says Stallone. &#x201C;I was very satisfied with it, and it had been a long journey to get that last one done. I thought, &#x2018;OK, I&#x2019;ve completed my mission.&#x2019; The more he presented the idea, the more I was opposed to it.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.37">Stallone reconsidered after <em>Fruitvale Station</em> came out, and Coogler, despite all the other opportunities now coming his way, still wanted to make <em>Creed</em>. &#x201C;I realized to do this would be actually a very interesting social experiment as well as a cinematic experiment,&#x201D; Stallone says now. &#x201C;Because it&#x2019;s being taken over by a whole new generation who is reinterpreting the character and perhaps even taking it on a completely different journey. And I was to be a passenger on that ride. And I said, &#x2018;You know, maybe this is interesting that I&#x2019;ve evolved into the Burgess Meredith character, and it&#x2019;s now time for another generation to shine.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.38">Stallone didn&#x2019;t know much about Jordan. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know if he could actually take the hardship that I knew was coming. Because this is not a weekend or six-week gig&#x2014;it&#x2019;s probably a ten-month situation where you literally live a monastic life, in a sense that you&#x2019;re in training constantly. You&#x2019;re eating four, five, six meals a day. Your mind is set in such a way that, if you&#x2019;re committed, you live this Spartan lifestyle, and then you begin to think like a fighter, you begin to move like a fighter.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.39">&#x201C;Sly knew Mike could act&#x2014;he had seen his work,&#x201D; says Coogler, &#x201C;but he was concerned about his work ethic, you know what I mean? And, really, what Sly was asking was: &#x2018;Is he gonna work as hard as I worked when I was doing these?&#x2019; And I would guarantee him that once he met Mike, all his questions would be answered. I still have footage from the first day that they met, and you know, they just really, really, really got great chemistry together, man.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3a"> At this point it might be instructive to hear their observations on first meeting each other.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3b">Stallone on Jordan: &#x201C;The first impression is that you have this very complex individual whose waters run very deep.

The chicken sandwiches, too big for any normal person to finish, have French fries folded into them. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t tell you about that one,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Out here in Jersey, that&#x2019;s kind of how we do it.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3f">As we eat, he explains to his mother and her friend all the travel he has coming up to promote <em>Fantastic Four</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3g">&#x201C;We&#x2019;re proud of you,&#x201D; Miss Rogers says. &#x201C;Really very proud of you.

I am.&#x201D; And he explains that we&#x2019;ve just been talking in the car about the things that have changed in the wake of the new attention he&#x2019;s receiving. &#x201C;Like people coming out of the woodwork and all of a sudden just treating me different,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Not in a negative way, but just like...it is what it is, I guess.&#x201D; His mother shares her own version&#x2014;the calls from people she hasn&#x2019;t heard from for a long time, which share all the usual friendly catch-up information until she hears: &#x201C;Oh, yeah, just one more thing...&#x201D; &#x201C;You know, whatever they want to ask you,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Whether it be a picture or a ticket to a premiere or whatever. You don&#x2019;t see it coming sometimes.&#x201D; And then she passes on the most recent request, for him to be grand marshal at a local homecoming.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3i">Soon he says his goodbyes, and we head back toward the city.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3j">There is no journey like the journey back to where we come from, because as it reminds us who we were, it also makes us see who we no longer are. Being back in Newark, and being asked about it, has clearly thrown up plenty of thoughts for Jordan&#x2014;about the good and the bad of his childhood; about paths taken and paths avoided, and perhaps about how thin and precarious the line is between them sometimes&#x2014;and on the ride back into the city, his tone is reflective.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3k">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a lot of memories, man,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;So many things that are familiar. So it&#x2019;s not <em>sad</em>. It&#x2019;s just like a nostalgic feeling of just being around things you remember. It&#x2019;s like that: This is where I came from, this is what built me, this is where I used to live, this is my home, this is me. And then there&#x2019;s a feeling of guilt, a little bit&#x2014;still having my parents live there, me living in L.A., them still being not yet where I need them to be or where I want them to be. That guilt of leaving the hood but your mom and dad are still there, but just for right now. You&#x2019;ve seen the house&#x2014;we&#x2019;re in the process of packing up and leaving. So I know they&#x2019;re coming out eventually. But that&#x2019;s how I feel right now. It&#x2019;s always weird when I leave my mom&#x2014;I always have a sense of sadness.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3l">And then there&#x2019;s the more general, complicated feelings that come with achievement and escape and empathy.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3m">&#x201C;After getting out, seeing so much of the world and seeing different things, and you come back to where you started,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;sometimes you want that for everybody, to be able to have that perspective. So it&#x2019;s a lot of different emotions.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3n">He knows that all of this might so easily have never happened. His acting career was triggered more or less by happenstance when the receptionist at his mother&#x2019;s doctor&#x2014;she has lupus&#x2014;mentioned that young Michael should try modeling. He&#x2019;d never thought of anything like that. If he had an ambition, it was to play basketball. I ask what he thought about this new idea at the time. &#x201C; &#x2018;Whatever...okay...cool,&#x2019; &#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t give a fuck. As a kid at 11, 12, you don&#x2019;t think that far ahead. I didn&#x2019;t care about that shit.

It wasn&#x2019;t something I ever wanted. Acting to me was something so foreign. Didn&#x2019;t give a fuck. It was so out of my hands, bro.&#x201D; To this day, he&#x2019;s never taken acting classes. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t come from that background, you know what I&#x2019;m saying? I just like being real. As real as I think you can be. I&#x2019;ve been doing it since I was 11 years old, and it&#x2019;s like I gradually grew into it.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3q"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3r">This summer&#x2019;s new version of <em>Fantastic Four</em>, of course, will turn out to be a textbook debacle. After a flurry of reviews that range from disappointed to savagely dismissive, the director Josh Trank posts a tweet before the opening weekend that effectively disowns the version of the movie being released. The ensuing grosses are massively below even the most pessimistic predictions, and multiple stories begin leaking about just how messy and conflicted the film&#x2019;s production was. Few of these stories directly involve Jordan, whose performance in the film somehow exists on its periphery, as though the few moments when he is allowed to speak freely are excerpted random snatches from a bigger, edgier performance delivered with an attitude that this movie had no room for. Though it won&#x2019;t have delivered him the international box-office credentials he hoped for, I doubt <em>Fantastic Four</em>&#x2019;s failure will damage him too much&#x2014;albeit for the sad and surprising reason that, for the first time in his movie career, it is quite hard to remember that he was even in it.</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3s">Just from <em>Creed</em>&#x2019;s trailer, it&#x2019;s clear that particular problem won&#x2019;t repeat itself there.

This was 1987, and his father was aware that someone else of this name was becoming popular. &#x201C;He didn&#x2019;t care,&#x201D; his son tells me. And to put the decision in perspective, the other Jordan was still four years away from his first championship&#x2014;&#x201C;He wasn&#x2019;t the legend, the icon, yet,&#x201D; Michael B. points out&#x2014;so his father had no reason to know what was coming or how much weight would be attached to that name. As for Michael B.&#x2019;s mother, when her son was profiled as an up-and-coming actor by a local New Jersey newspaper at the age of 17, she was asked her thoughts about her son&#x2019;s name. Her reply? &#x201C;After 89 hours of labor, I told my husband, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t care what you name him.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3v"> Jordan realized when he was young that his name came with a lot of baggage. &#x201C;It made me competitive, you know,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I played basketball a lot growing up, and people used to tease and joke about the name. Until I got on the court, and then they didn&#x2019;t talk as much. So that was definitely something that pushed me, moving forward.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3w"> For his first acting roles, he appeared in the credits simply as &#x201C;Michael Jordan,&#x201D; until the Screen Actors Guild pointed out that this name was already taken. (He says the story that he was mistakenly sent a $45,000 <em>Space Jam</em> check is untrue, but that he did get sent some tax forms intended for his namesake.) He needed to find something different. &#x201C;Small fish, big pond,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;MJ won that battle.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".scwbrylyio.1.1.0.0.4.3x"> At first he considered using his middle name, Bakari, as a surname to become Michael Bakari. &#x201C;My family calls me Bakari,&#x201D; he points out. &#x201C;Nobody calls me Michael. Anybody that really knows me&#x2014;like, knows me knows me&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t call me Michael. My mom, even when I&#x2019;m in trouble, it&#x2019;s &#x2018;Bakari!&#x2019; My spiritual name&#x2014;in Swahili it means &#x2018;of noble promise.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s why names are very powerful, you know. Bakari&#x2019;s something that&#x2019;s been said to me all my life by the people I really care about and respect.&#x201D; But in the end he decided that just a hint of Bakari was enough; that&#x2019;s how he became Michael B.
