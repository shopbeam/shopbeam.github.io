  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestBloomberg via Getty Images\u000A\u000A _**\u000A\u000A](http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2014/06/video-game-life-lessons.html)\u000A\u000A Back in the \u002790s and early aughts, my Gameboy was like my best friend. I even hacked a book once so I could play it during silent reading in middle school (sorry, mom). These days, it\u0027s been replaced by my iPhone, which comes with its own host of games, some good and some bad. I\u0027ve always been a nintendo kid—just the other day I bought a vintage lapel pin of Link from Zelda, and am actively involved in an ongoing Super Smash Brothers league of sorts. Needless to say Candy Crush and the other games available in the app store have never really piqued my interest. But today, Nintendo has revealed plans to develop games for smartphones, tablets, and PCs in partnership with Japanese Gaming megacompany DeNA. They won\u0027t be duplicating existing titles, but rather creating new ones with familiar characters and worlds in order to create a solid gaming experience. This is big. This is like getting a star in Mario Kart when you\u0027re already in first place, this is like getting a flute in Super Mario Bros 3, this is like destroying everybody in multi-player Goldeneye with one artfully placed proximity mine. I\u0027ve got hope, I\u0027ve got hope that Nintendo will read this and make these nine games we\u0027ve loved for so long.\u000A\u000ADuck Hunt: I mean, come on, this is easy. You couldn\u0027t exactly do it the old school NES way with a gun (for like, a million reasons), but if there were something where you had to tap the screen to fire the shot, it would be pretty entertaining. The speed and volume of the ducks would have to be faster than the original to make it a challenge, but there\u0027s potential here.\u000A\u000ASuper Mario Something: As Nintendo, you can\u0027t promise the world you\u0027re coming to smartphones and not deliver us a Super Mario something. That\u0027s like telling somebody you\u0027re giving them a puppy and then giving them a box of cereal. Soulless, senseless, and fucked up. Of course, there\u0027s a lot of directions you can go with this—old school classic, Super NES (my personal favorite), N64 (revolutionary), or something more advanced. Whatever it is, just stay true to Mario. \u0022It\u0027s a meee, Mario! ON YOUR SMARTPHONE.\u0022\u000A\u000AMario Kart: Okay okay, similar to the above, but with the wireless capabilities on smartphones these days, you could do some really interesting things with the Mario Kart legacy and multiplayer mode. Racing games are pretty common on smartphones too, so you have to imagine this has at least been mentioned by the minds.\u000A\u000AZelda Anything: My dream of dreams would be an Ocarina of Time style adventure. That was honestly the height of the Zelda games. That was when technology finally caught up to imagination and the whole experience got to new levels (No disrespect to previous versions). As a franchise, Zelda is just as important as Mario, so this can\u0027t be overlooked. I need to find the tri-force. I have to. I must. The fate of Hyrule is in my hands (on my phone).\u000A\u000ACalifornia Games: I think of all the Nintendo games, this one frustrated me the most. I\u0027m not sure if any of you ever participated in the rollerblading event here, but it was straight up impossible. But it was that kind of wonderful impossible that kept you trying for hours upon hours, from when mom made you lunch to when mom made you dinner. Also, it was one of the first, and best, sports games I remember. Wouldn\u0027t mind if they did it with throwback graphics. I\u0027d happily sit with my phone and try that rollerblading over and over and over.\u000A\u000ADonkey Kong: To be honest with you guys, I was never a huge fan of Donkey Kong. I didn\u0027t really approach this one until N64 came out, and the piling on of characters like Diddy and Dixie seemed a little much for me. However, it\u0027s such an important part of the Nintendo pantheon that it can\u0027t be ignored. Keep it old school, though, please.\u000A\u000ATetris: Okay, yes, there are plenty of Tetris options out there, but I want one created by Nintendo. I want the original recipe. I want that damn theme song stuck in my head for DAYS. I want all the lines. Give me the lines.\u000A\u000AStar Fox: What would really round out this mix is an awesome in-your-face space adventure with animals. Luckily, Star Fox and his crew can fill that void. For this, it would be best to keep the gameplay in the ships, like the N64 version, as opposed to the first person action on Dinosaur Planet. Back to the Lylat system!\u000A\u000APaperboy: A true classic, but updated. Imagine riding up that sidewalk once more, throwing papers, avoiding the dogs, the neighbors, and that weird construction worker that definitely doesn\u0027t look like he\u0027s using a jackhammer, but actually is. You know exactly what I\u0027m talking about.\u000A\u000AAs much as it pains me to say this, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a way to recreate the gameplay experience of Super Smash Bros on the iPhone. I only say this because it seems like such a glaring omission. But in truth, the screen is too small. Even on a decent size television the action can be hard to follow. Some things are sacred.",

But today, Nintendo has revealed plans to develop games for smartphones, tablets, and PCs in partnership with Japanese Gaming megacompany DeNA. They won&#x2019;t be duplicating existing titles, but rather creating new ones with familiar characters and worlds in order to create a solid gaming experience. This is big. This is like getting a star in Mario Kart when you&#x2019;re already in first place, this is like getting a flute in Super Mario Bros 3, this is like destroying everybody in multi-player Goldeneye with one artfully placed proximity mine. I&#x2019;ve got hope, I&#x2019;ve got hope that Nintendo will read this and make these nine games we&#x2019;ve loved for so long.</p><p data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Duck Hunt</strong>: I mean, come on, this is easy. You couldn&#x2019;t exactly do it the old school NES way with a gun (for like, a million reasons), but if there were something where you had to tap the screen to fire the shot, it would be pretty entertaining. The speed and volume of the ducks would have to be faster than the original to make it a challenge, but there&#x2019;s potential here.</p><p data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Super Mario Something</strong>: As Nintendo, you can&#x2019;t promise the world you&#x2019;re coming to smartphones and not deliver us a Super Mario something. That&#x2019;s like telling somebody you&#x2019;re giving them a puppy and then giving them a box of cereal. Soulless, senseless, and fucked up. Of course, there&#x2019;s a lot of directions you can go with this&#x2014;old school classic, Super NES (my personal favorite), N64 (revolutionary), or something more advanced. Whatever it is, just stay true to Mario. &quot;It&#x2019;s a meee, Mario! ON YOUR SMARTPHONE.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Mario Kart</strong>: Okay okay, similar to the above, but with the wireless capabilities on smartphones these days, you could do some really interesting things with the Mario Kart legacy and multiplayer mode. Racing games are pretty common on smartphones too, so you have to imagine this has at least been mentioned by the minds.</p><p data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Zelda Anything</strong>: My dream of dreams would be an Ocarina of Time style adventure. That was honestly the height of the Zelda games. That was when technology finally caught up to imagination and the whole experience got to new levels (No disrespect to previous versions). As a franchise, Zelda is just as important as Mario, so this can&#x2019;t be overlooked. I need to find the tri-force. I have to. I must. The fate of Hyrule is in my hands (on my phone).</p><p data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>California Games</strong>: I think of all the Nintendo games, this one frustrated me the most. I&#x2019;m not sure if any of you ever participated in the rollerblading event here, but it was straight up impossible. But it was that kind of wonderful impossible that kept you trying for hours upon hours, from when mom made you lunch to when mom made you dinner. Also, it was one of the first, and best, sports games I remember. Wouldn&#x2019;t mind if they did it with throwback graphics. I&#x2019;d happily sit with my phone and try that rollerblading over and over and over.</p><p data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Donkey Kong</strong>: To be honest with you guys, I was never a huge fan of Donkey Kong. I didn&#x2019;t really approach this one until N64 came out, and the piling on of characters like Diddy and Dixie seemed a little much for me. However, it&#x2019;s such an important part of the Nintendo pantheon that it can&#x2019;t be ignored. Keep it old school, though, please.</p><p data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Tetris</strong>: Okay, yes, there are plenty of Tetris options out there, but I want one created by Nintendo. I want the original recipe. I want that damn theme song stuck in my head for DAYS. I want all the lines. Give me the lines.</p><p data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Star Fox</strong>: What would really round out this mix is an awesome in-your-face space adventure with animals. Luckily, Star Fox and his crew can fill that void. For this, it would be best to keep the gameplay in the ships, like the N64 version, as opposed to the first person action on Dinosaur Planet. Back to the Lylat system!</p><p data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Paperboy</strong>: A true classic, but updated. Imagine riding up that sidewalk once more, throwing papers, avoiding the dogs, the neighbors, and that weird construction worker that definitely doesn&#x2019;t look like he&#x2019;s using a jackhammer, but actually is. You know exactly what I&#x2019;m talking about.</p><p data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.4.e">As much as it pains me to say this, I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s a way to recreate the gameplay experience of Super Smash Bros on the iPhone. I only say this because it seems like such a glaring omission. But in truth, the screen is too small. Even on a decent size television the action can be hard to follow. Some things are sacred.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".o7mgknh62o.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
