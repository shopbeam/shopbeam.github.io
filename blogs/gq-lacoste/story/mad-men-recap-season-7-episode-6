  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022Does this family exist anymore?\u0022 asks Peggy, who\u0027s far from the only person in this episode with domesticity issues. \u0022Little Katie\u0027s pregnant, Jimmy got drafted, but there\u0027s a burger and fries on that table?\u0022 The growing complication of family life in 1969 was everywhere in this week\u0027s Mad Men with everyone grappling with second marriages both prospective and decaying, and the loneliness that won\u0027t go away, even when everything goes absolutely right. Those first images of homemaker Betty and the Ossining crew, this is not.\u000A\u000APete Campbell, ever the smarmy little punk, thinks he\u0027s run as far away as possible from his prim and proper marriage with his new girlfriend, Bonnie, a Californian blonde sex kitten who at first appears to be everything that Trudy wasn\u0027t: totally chill with his work life, and kinky enough to propose a little mile-high rendezvous in the airplane bathroom. \u0022I want you shopping all day...and screwing all night,\u0022 he says, because Pete can\u0027t help but but reveal all those fiendish power fantasies when given the chance. But then the talk turns to divorce and remarriage, Pete\u0027s compelled to stand her up to go visit a daughter who barely recognizes him and a still-wife who\u0027s off galavanting with other men—which Pete calls \u0022immoral,\u0022 because again, Pete—and suddenly Bonnie has bees in her, well, you know, and this whole carefree California sexcapade is just such a drag, man. At heart, Campbell\u0027s still the BB gun-toting accounts rookie he was at the very beginning—and when his toys are taken away, or when they demonstrate independent thought, he\u0027s not pleased, to say the least. He\u0027s always reaching for that superficially Don Draper life, and getting rebuffed.\u000A\u000ATeflon Don himself, meanwhile, seems well past that phase, with a wife he truly wants to love and a psyche that won\u0027t let him. It\u0027s no surprise given Don\u0027s tendency to be a moody, selfish crumbum, that his latest weekend with Megan goes as well as we\u0027ve seen it when she takes it upon herself to visit him. He\u0027s in his comfort zone here, close to his work, but keeping her far enough away that she can\u0027t see his downsized office (though she does find out that the new hires haven\u0027t seen enough of him to know that he\u0027s married). \u0022Tell me you didn\u0027t miss this,\u0022 he commands, after seeing a picturesque image of her setting up breakfast on the patio (the ad man loves his convoluted images), and of course she demurs. But all of a sudden, she\u0027s looking for her FONDUE POT to take back west, which is like the \u002760s version of canceling your shared data plan. And he\u0027s offering to bring her summer clothes at the end of July like some kind of simpleton, and she\u0027s proposing meeting up somewhere where, you know, lives don\u0027t get in the way, and Don is doing that constipated Don Draper Stare, and everyone\u0027s all like a rolling stone again. What\u0027s so frustrating about these neverending cycles of discontent and self-destruction on Mad Men is how achingly true to life they are. Don and Megan are both trying, and for the former especially, that seems like a Herculean leap of progress in itself. But can anything keep them from circling the drain?\u000A\u000AThe prospect of love, for better or worse, is what Joan wants, and is what makes her reject Bob Benson and his pragmatic Draper Youth act. Her first marriage was born of convenience and social advancement, and look how that turned out! Working moms are deemed \u0022too depressing\u0022 by Don for the Burger Chef campaign, and this is what he\u0027s getting at—that even to this day, every step forward in the professional world feels like a sacrifice of something else, and the two most successful women we know in this world long for love, and are beset on all sides by inadequate, infuriating bums (Peggy) and Machiavellian suitors eager to get at the goods (Joan), even the ones who prefer the company of men. But it looks like Benson\u0027s moving on to greener pastures at Buick, as quickly as he reappeared. Best of luck, man! Maybe you can bring Manolo along!\u000A\u000AWhich brings us to Peggy. Channeling her personal life (and the secret of her 30th birthday) into her work, sitting in Don/Lou\u0027s office all weekend, drinking to match—she\u0027s more like the mentor she disowned than she knows. And it\u0027s that same mentor who comes to the rescue, but not in the narcissistic Draper-ian way she anticipates, leading to one of the best Mad Men scenes we\u0027ve seen in a while, and an easy parallel to the landmark season 4 episode, \u0022The Suitcase.\u0022 Don perfectly plays subordinate and soundboard to his \u0022boss,\u0022 whom the old boys thought wasn\u0027t man enough to bring it home, but an older and wiser subordinate, who knows the pain and isolation of being the only creative perfectionist in the room. Peggy still doesn\u0027t know Don in some ways, throwing out questions like \u0022What do you have to worry about?\u0022 (eerily similar to something she said long ago: \u0022You have everything, and so much of it.\u0022) and \u0022Did you do that with your family?\u0022 Uh, not really, Peg. But he leads her perfectly to her own creative epiphany, and then they\u0027re dancing in the office to Sinatra, and it\u0027s all so sweet. Of course, the purest connections Don ever has are to the women he won\u0027t sleep with, and Don sees so much of himself in Peggy. But given that, isn\u0027t his reassurance—\u0022I worry about a lot of things, but I don\u0027t worry about you.\u0022—an empty platitude of the highest order? After all, this is Mad Men. Nobody is happy, nobody is safe, and everybody needs worrying about.\u000A\u000ABut for a moment, at least, we see Pete, Peggy, and Don—the good ol\u0027 crew, at this point—gathered somewhere that\u0027s not a home, but better than one: a clean, well-lit restaurant, a home-run pitch in hand, and the company of the only other people who know the feeling, who understand. \u0022I hate even the word \u0027family,\u0027 it\u0027s vague,\u0022 says Pete. And he\u0027s right, a family could be anything—even three lonely souls, talking shop, wiping ketchup off their faces. Ensconced, for a brief while, against the growing dark outside.\u000A\u000AElsewhere: As Roger termed it, the \u0022plan to win the war\u0022 is in full effect, as Jim Cutler, in response to losing Chevy, wants to pimp their shiny new computer and make Harry Crane a partner. We\u0027re the FiveThirtyEight of Madison Avenue! he seems to want to say; Bob\u0027s Draper Jr. act includes another Mad Men throwback, bailing big-wig clients out of jail; Stan Rizzo\u0027s in love, and he doesn\u0027t care who knows it! Well except Peggy, because he\u0027s trying to get his swerve on this weekend, mountain-man belly in full bloom.\u000A\u000ALine of the Episode: \u0022The New York Athletic Club frowns on people making advances in their steam room.\u0022—Roger Sterling\u0027s Immaculate Poker Face",

family exist anymore?&quot; asks Peggy, who&apos;s far from the only person in this episode with domesticity issues. &quot;Little Katie&apos;s pregnant, Jimmy got drafted, but there&apos;s a burger and fries on that table?&quot; The growing complication of family life in 1969 was everywhere in this week&apos;s <em>Mad Men </em>with everyone grappling with second marriages both prospective and decaying, and the loneliness that won&apos;t go away, even when everything goes absolutely right. Those first images of homemaker Betty and the Ossining crew, this is not.</p><p data-reactid=".1nfmz4xs35s.1.1.0.0.4.2">Pete Campbell, ever the smarmy little punk, thinks he&apos;s run as far away as possible from his prim and proper marriage with his new girlfriend, Bonnie, a Californian blonde sex kitten who at first appears to be everything that Trudy wasn&apos;t: totally chill with his work life, and kinky enough to propose a little mile-high rendezvous in the airplane bathroom. &quot;I want you shopping all day...and screwing all night,&quot; he says, because Pete can&apos;t help but but reveal all those fiendish power fantasies when given the chance. But then the talk turns to divorce and remarriage, Pete&apos;s compelled to stand her up to go visit a daughter who barely recognizes him and a still-wife who&apos;s off galavanting with other men&#x2014;which Pete calls &quot;immoral,&quot; because again, Pete&#x2014;and suddenly Bonnie has bees in her, well, you know, and this whole carefree California sexcapade is just such a <em>drag</em>, man. At heart, Campbell&apos;s still the BB gun-toting accounts rookie he was at the very beginning&#x2014;and when his toys are taken away, or when they demonstrate independent thought, he&apos;s not pleased, to say the least. He&apos;s always reaching for that superficially Don Draper life, and getting rebuffed.</p><p data-reactid=".1nfmz4xs35s.1.1.0.0.4.3">Teflon Don himself, meanwhile, seems well past that phase, with a wife he truly wants to love and a psyche that won&apos;t let him. It&apos;s no surprise given Don&apos;s tendency to be a moody, selfish crumbum, that his latest weekend with Megan goes as well as we&apos;ve seen it when <em>she</em> takes it upon herself to visit <em>him</em>. He&apos;s in his comfort zone here, close to his work, but keeping her far enough away that she can&apos;t see his downsized office (though she does find out that the new hires haven&apos;t seen enough of him to know that he&apos;s married). &quot;Tell me you didn&apos;t miss this,&quot; he commands, after seeing a picturesque image of her setting up breakfast on the patio (the ad man <em>loves</em> his convoluted images), and of course she demurs. But all of a sudden, she&apos;s looking for her FONDUE POT to take back west, which is like the &apos;60s version of canceling your shared data plan. And he&apos;s offering to bring her summer clothes at the <em>end of July </em>like some kind of simpleton, and she&apos;s proposing meeting up somewhere where, you know, <em>lives</em> don&apos;t get in the way, and Don is doing that constipated Don Draper Stare, and everyone&apos;s all like a rolling stone again. What&apos;s so frustrating about these neverending cycles of discontent and self-destruction on <em>Mad Men</em> is how achingly true to life they are. Don and Megan are both trying, and for the former especially, that seems like a Herculean leap of progress in itself. But can anything keep them from circling the drain?</p><p data-reactid=".1nfmz4xs35s.1.1.0.0.4.5">The prospect of love, for better or worse, is what Joan wants, and is what makes her reject Bob Benson and his pragmatic Draper Youth act. Her first marriage was born of convenience and social advancement, and look how that turned out! Working moms are deemed &quot;too depressing&quot; by Don for the Burger Chef campaign, and this is what he&apos;s getting at&#x2014;that even to this day, every step forward in the professional world feels like a sacrifice of something else, and the two most successful women we know in this world long for love, and are beset on all sides by inadequate, infuriating bums (Peggy) and Machiavellian suitors eager to get at the goods (Joan), even the ones who prefer the company of men. But it looks like Benson&apos;s moving on to greener pastures at Buick, as quickly as he reappeared. Best of luck, man! Maybe you can bring Manolo along!</p><p data-reactid=".1nfmz4xs35s.1.1.0.0.4.6">Which brings us to Peggy. Channeling her personal life (and the secret of her 30th birthday) into her work, sitting in Don/Lou&apos;s office all weekend, drinking to match&#x2014;she&apos;s more like the mentor she disowned than she knows. And it&apos;s that same mentor who comes to the rescue, but not in the narcissistic Draper-ian way she anticipates, leading to one of the best <em>Mad Men </em>scenes we&apos;ve seen in a while, and an easy parallel to the landmark season 4 episode, &quot;The Suitcase.&quot; Don perfectly plays subordinate and soundboard to his &quot;boss,&quot; whom the old boys thought wasn&apos;t man enough to bring it home, but an older and wiser subordinate, who knows the pain and isolation of being the only creative perfectionist in the room. Peggy still doesn&apos;t <em>know</em> Don in some ways, throwing out questions like &quot;What do you have to worry about?&quot; (eerily similar to something she said long ago: &quot;You have everything, and so much of it.&quot;) and &quot;Did you do that with your family?&quot; Uh, not really, Peg. But he leads her perfectly to her own creative epiphany, and then they&apos;re dancing in the office to Sinatra, and it&apos;s all so sweet. Of course, the purest connections Don ever has are to the women he won&apos;t sleep with, and Don sees so much of himself in Peggy. But given that, isn&apos;t his reassurance&#x2014;&quot;I worry about a lot of things, but I don&apos;t worry about you.&quot;&#x2014;an empty platitude of the highest order? After all, this is <em>Mad Men</em>. Nobody is happy, nobody is safe, and <em>everybody </em>needs worrying about.</p><p data-reactid=".1nfmz4xs35s.1.1.0.0.4.7">But for a moment, at least, we see Pete, Peggy, and Don&#x2014;the good ol&apos; crew, at this point&#x2014;gathered somewhere that&apos;s not a home, but better than one: a clean, well-lit restaurant, a home-run pitch in hand, and the company of the only other people who know the feeling, who understand. &quot;I hate even the word &apos;family,&apos; it&apos;s vague,&quot; says Pete. And he&apos;s right, a family could be anything&#x2014;even three lonely souls, talking shop, wiping ketchup off their faces. Ensconced, for a brief while, against the growing dark outside.</p><p data-reactid=".1nfmz4xs35s.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Elsewhere: </strong>As Roger termed it, the &quot;plan to win the war&quot; is in full effect, as Jim Cutler, in response to losing Chevy, wants to pimp their shiny new computer and make Harry Crane a partner. <em>We&apos;re the FiveThirtyEight of Madison Avenue!</em> he seems to want to say; Bob&apos;s Draper Jr. act includes another <em>Mad Men </em>throwback, bailing big-wig clients out of jail; Stan Rizzo&apos;s in love, and he doesn&apos;t care who knows it! Well except Peggy, because he&apos;s trying to get his swerve on this weekend, mountain-man belly in full bloom.</p><p data-reactid=".1nfmz4xs35s.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>Line of the Episode:
