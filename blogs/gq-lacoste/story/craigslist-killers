  	    "articleBody": "It is November, and 5 a.m. feels like winter. As he has on many mornings these past four months of 2011, Brogan Rafferty, age 16, wakes up early to help his friend and mentor, Rich Beasley, on an errand of Rich\u0027s design. Brogan doesn\u0027t need to pick up Rich until 6, but unlike your typical teenager, Brogan likes to get up early and drink coffee in the morning so he has some time to himself before he leaves the house. Today they are going to pick up a man named Timothy Kern, age 47, who will be waiting for them in a strip-mall parking lot with all his earthly possessions. Like the three men who preceded him on this grim adventure, Tim answered an ad on Craigslist that said: We need someone to watch our farm down in southern Ohio. Live for free in a double-wide trailer, nothing in the way of duties except to take in the peacefulness of the countryside and remark on the changing of the seasons and make sure no one steals any farm equipment or perpetrates any mischief. The pay is $300 a week.\u000A\u000ABrogan pulls up in front of Rich\u0027s with plenty of time and throws his Buick into park. Rich comes lumbering across the front lawn, expelling steamy breath into the dark Akron morning, and deposits himself into the front seat. Brogan says nothing, as is his habit. Brogan is a junior of middling academic record at Stow-Munroe Falls High School, remarkable to his peers and teachers mostly for being such a giant of a human being. Six feet five inches, close to 230 pounds, and not finished growing yet. He\u0027s a laconic character, polite but suspicious of authority, prematurely world-weary with an easily inflamed sense of injustice and an almost pathological ability to keep his own counsel. The agenda today can\u0027t be a big mystery to Brogan. After all, he was the one who dug the hole yesterday out at a plot of neglected suburban scrubland near the old Rolling Acres Mall—about yay wide and yay deep and big enough for an adult male body. Rich, not being partial to manual labor, had watched. As they pull out onto the road, Brogan wills himself not to think about what he and Rich will be doing this morning.\u000A\u000ARichard Beasley: age 52, former convict, motorcycle enthusiast, professed man of God, known on the Akron street as Chaplain Rich. He\u0027d started taking Brogan to church when Brogan was just 9 years old and already almost comically large and serious and quiet. Since then Rich has become probably Brogan\u0027s best friend, his uncle-dad, his guide to the Gospels of the Bible and the affairs of the teenage heart, to the mysteries of Akron and the even deeper mysteries of Brogan\u0027s own parents. Brogan calls him his counselor.\u000A\u000AThe enterprise that will bring them to Tim Kern began in August, in the dead of summer. Rich had discovered that there was a warrant out for his arrest, the product of a twenty-month investigation into the goings-on at a halfway house he operated. If he were arrested, he could very well spend the rest of his life in prison. And so Rich began to target men like Tim. At first because he needed a new identity, and later to provide a kind of income to support a life on the run.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s like Rich\u0027s Craigslist ad was designed for a certain kind of person: male, white, unattached, aging, no longer fostering unreasonable ambitions or fueled by fantasies about what he might turn out to be someday, someone on the downward slope of life for whom things maybe haven\u0027t gone exactly as planned. It is sort of a retirement plan for the obsolete white man. In the industrial northeast of Ohio at the far side of the Great Recession, there is no shortage of these people. Rich has actually been interviewing subjects he carefully selects from the hundreds of men who reply to the ads. He\u0027s been showing up at the food court of the Chapel Hill mall with an official-looking application form, affecting the air of an affable blue-collar-type landowner who just wants to find someone friendly to camp out on his spread while he\u0027s up in Akron conducting the business of his normal life. Rich ascertains certain things from these gentlemen: Do you have a wife or kids or people you need to keep in close touch with? This farm, it doesn\u0027t have cell coverage; are you a fellow who can live in peaceful isolation? And what type of vehicle do you have, and would you be bringing that down with you when you came, and oh, there\u0027s a laptop computer? Bring it all with you, and my nephew and I will drive you on down to Caldwell.\u000A\u000ARich tells Brogan to get off the highway at an exit in the town of Canton. He says that Tim Kern is waiting in his car not too far from there. Brogan is quiet, as always. People tend to make assumptions about you when you are huge and so quiet you could be mistaken for mute. But Brogan is also observant. Rich smells this morning of bar soap and, beneath that, something fetid. Brogan notices he\u0027s wearing the same clothes as yesterday, and he wonders whether these are now the only clothes Rich has. Rich has always been a rumpled character, a corpulent man in denim and leather and boots, with long white hair he wears in a balding grandmother\u0027s braid. But one of Rich\u0027s life principles is to maintain a bright hygienic line between him and the street people he ministers to. His message: I live among you by choice; I can leave if I want. But by November of 2011, near the end of Richard Beasley\u0027s run, things are falling apart on both the bodily maintenance and criminal mastermind fronts. Rich has been dyeing his hair as part of his new identity, but now the filmy silver roots have grown out. He\u0027s abandoned his house and is now living on the east side of Akron in a rented room that doesn\u0027t even have a door you can close.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AA Tale of Two Dads: Mike Rafferty (left), with his son, Brogan, was a better but ultimately less formative father figure than Richard Beasley (right). Photo: Courtesy of the subjects\u0027 families\u000A\u000ABrogan will later say that he senses about Rich this morning a new kind of desperation. A more profound and disturbing desperation, if it\u0027s possible to vibe more profoundly disturbing than this whole thing has been from the start. In less than a month, Brogan will deliver a series of lengthy confessions to the FBI about the elaborately planned but almost logic-defying crimes he and Rich committed together. If you listen to the confessions carefully, they begin to sound different when Brogan starts describing this morning\u0027s events with Tim Kern. Throughout most of the hours of his statements, Brogan maintains a tone of almost stolid impassivity, sounding like someone who\u0027d merely watched a series of killings on a strange unmarked videotape he received in the mail—what happened was awful, certainly, but concerned events that had nothing to do with him. But when he talks about Tim, it\u0027s like things won\u0027t stay psychologically tamped down. It\u0027s as if whatever mental box he\u0027d built to house these events so they would be out of sight, on this day that box comes unsealed and everything hidden there spills out.\u000A\u000AThere is a surveillance camera in the parking lot where Tim Kern is waiting in his 1995 Buick LeSabre. Footage from that camera will indicate it is five minutes after 6 A.M. on that morning of Sunday November 13, 2011, when Rich and Brogan arrive to get him.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIt is hard not to like Rich Beasley right away. When I first see him, sitting in navy prison pants in the visitors\u0027 hall at Chillicothe Correctional Institution, which is situated in farmlands south of Columbus that are on this winter day frozen into a lifeless meringue, he stands and greets me with a commiserating smile that says: Can you believe it, the world is so fucked up, but did we really expect anything different? His hand is an old overboiled ham hock that envelops mine in a shake. He is large, with a fulsome white goatee and an untrimmed mustache that covers the absence of front teeth and works as a kind of flap behind which bites of microwave cheeseburger disappear as a dog disappears into a flap in a back door. He has lively, kind of almondy-shaped blue eyes that do not shy from contact and don\u0027t seem to have a thing in the world to hide. They might be said to have a mischievous twinkle. The hairs of the eyebrows are unruly and backward-reaching. He looks like the Grinch, or at least a little like he was drawn by a cartoonist.\u000A\u000A\u0022I have to admit I don\u0027t get GQ magazine,\u0022 he says. \u0022I get Easyriders magazine and something called Armchair General, about military history. I also read The Week cover to cover every week.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s here, in the old death-row visitors\u0027 wing at Chillicothe, a vast empty hall surrounded by two stories of Shawshank Redemption-vintage cells, that we speak for a total of about eight hours over two days. It\u0027s easy to see that Rich was a preacher. The man has the gift of gab. But he\u0027s not what you\u0027d call silver-tongued. His talent in the sermonizing arena was never soaring oratory, more of a folksy sociability. He can talk knowledgeably about using a store-bought still to make moonshine and the origin and bylaws of the Hells Angels, as well as how right Jesus was when he said to give unto Caesar what was Caesar\u0027s. Rich says he always lived by the laws of God but that, when he went on the run from the law, he wasn\u0027t living by the laws of man and that\u0027s wrong, so shame on him.\u000A\u000A\u0022You seem like a guy people feel comfortable with,\u0022 I tell him.\u000A\u000AHe releases another commiserating grin, this one called guilty as charged. \u0022People say that,\u0022 he replies.\u000A\u000AGod has been the one constant in his life, he tells me, thanks to his mom.\u000A\u000A\u0022I accepted Jesus as my savior when I was 12 years old,\u0022 he says. \u0022I was baptized then, and that\u0027s all the baptizing I needed, according to my religion.\u0022\u000A\u000ARich\u0027s original and most defining role in Brogan\u0027s life was always: the guy who took him to church. First as a good-works type of deal and then because they were homeys. Rich did his ministering in the ghetto, but he and Brogan went to services at the Chapel, a giant evangelical church that looks not unlike an aging community college and serves thousands of mostly middle-class parishioners who don\u0027t fancy putting on airs when it comes to worship but value community and charity and Christ. Rich\u0027s mother, Carol, has been a member in good standing at the Chapel for forty years.\u000A\u000A\u0022I took him to church because he needed it,\u0022 Rich says. \u0022It was the right thing to do. His father would go to his [bikers] clubhouse on Friday and wouldn\u0027t be home. And his mother, well… But Brogan loved church. That was his punishment—he wouldn\u0027t be allowed to go to church.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Scott Heckel/The Repoitory/AP Photo\u000A\u000AHelp Needed: Timothy Kern was nearly broke when Rich and Brogan picked him up in this Canton parking lot.\u000A\u000AThe two of them were also regulars at the Bible study held in the orchestra room afterward, where some socializing and fellowship were had. Everyone thought they were a funny pair, Brogan and Rich. The little-boy giant and the aging former biker. They tried to get Brogan in with the kids his age, but he just preferred to be with the older folks.\u000A\u000A\u0022He was 9, but he looked 14,\u0022 Nancy Wilson, one of the regular members of the Bible study, told me at a Panera Bread in Akron one morning last winter. \u0022Brogan was like a puppy. He was following Richard around.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd Rich, on the other hand: \u0022Well, he maintained what you call the rough look. You know, the down-and-outer look,\u0022 Nancy says. \u0022He was very disheveled, but he felt that gave him an \u0027in\u0027 with the people he was ministering to.\u0022\u000A\u000ANancy, and the whole Bible-study group, got to know Rich from the letters he sent his mom when he was doing some time in prison in the early 2000s. Carol would read the letters aloud, and then they\u0027d pray for him. They\u0027d heard, Nancy says, how he\u0027d gotten in trouble the first time, down in Texas, when he wasn\u0027t more than 25 years old. A series of robberies. Then a gun charge that he told everyone wasn\u0027t his fault, and a couple of other scrapes that he explained were really just misunderstandings. It did seem to Nancy that he spent a lot of his letters complaining about the bedding and the food and didn\u0027t say too many remorseful things, but the group was compassionate, because give the guy a break, he was in jail, after all. Plus, they\u0027d all do anything for Carol. She lived a real Christian life. There wasn\u0027t a thing she wouldn\u0027t do or give to help people.\u000A\u000AAnd after he got out, Rich really seemed to have found his way back to God. He\u0027d become a chaplain. Well, he hadn\u0027t technically been ordained, but he said he was training up. The group knew all about that halfway house he\u0027d started down on Yale Street, where he lived. There were some weird people who used to stay there, certainly. That one guy ended up being a sex offender. But these were Rich\u0027s people—the downtrodden, the addicted, the half-wits, the streetwalkers, petty thieves, and wrecks of Akron. He lived among them. Because that\u0027s who needed help.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: The FBI/AP Photo\u000A\u000ATimothy Kern.\u000A\u000AAkron belongs to the official demographic denomination of Midsize American City—your Springfield, MOs, your Greensboro, NCs—the type of place most people have heard of but almost no one has been to on purpose. In a city of this size, with a downtown of no more than a handful of city blocks, without even a proper ghetto, the street is small enough that it is mostly on a first-name basis with itself. And it\u0027s true that the street was on a first-name basis with Chaplain Rich. To hear Rich tell it (and a lot of his claims check out), he had ministered to them at the Hope Café, where the streetwalkers would gather for some free coffee and four-color Jesus brochures; he had fed them from the food bank; he had delivered bread to the drunks at the bars so that even if they\u0027d boozed away their paycheck, they could come home with something for their families to eat. He conducted weekly Bible studies at his halfway house for the unwanted and forgotten and lived with them and tolerated their vices and their personality defects, their vomit and blood and urine, and endured what no other man could endure, and still had charity in his heart. That is the story he tells. And it\u0027s what Nancy Wilson and her husband, Dave, mostly believed.\u000A\u000A\u0022We overlooked things,\u0022 Dave says now. \u0022Uh. Signals. We overlooked signals. They were there.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThere really is a plot of land down in Caldwell, just like Rich promised in the Craigslist ad. It technically belongs to a coal-mining company. It\u0027s beautiful in that corner of Ohio\u0027s Appalachia, the hillocks bunched up like geological bedcovers and frosted in woods. It feels like being back in what even people who have known no such simpler time refer to as a simpler time.\u000A\u000AIf on this November morning you were to head out of Caldwell, up onto Rado ridge, past a couple of desolate houses, and turn onto Don Warner Road, you would find \u0022the farm.\u0022 That road will drop you down into what people here call a \u0022holler,\u0022 and if you stop midway down the hill and take the half-grown-over four-wheeler track, you would find a hole containing the body of one Ralph Geiger, naked and partly decomposed. Ralph Geiger being the name on Rich\u0027s driver\u0027s license and pill prescriptions these days. The body has been here since summer, when the leaves were green; now it sits beneath four feet of damp earth coursed by hunters out savoring the final days of bow-hunting season. If you left the four-wheeler track and traveled farther downhill to the wooded floor of the holler, you would find under two feet of dirt the body of David Pauley, who\u0027d answered the ad in October, when the leaves had begun to change. He\u0027d driven up from Virginia with a pickup and a U-Haul filled with model trains, NASCAR memorabilia, a shotgun. Maybe fifty feet away from David Pauley\u0027s body is a hole that Brogan had dug not much more than a week ago. It is empty except for several inches of rainwater—it had been meant for the body of Scott Davis, who\u0027d answered the ad and decided to move all the way up from South Carolina. But with Scott something had apparently gone wrong with the gun. Rich had only been able to shoot Scott in the arm, and then Scott had taken off into the woods. Bleeding and cold, Scott hid in the underbrush for seven hours, until, after dark, he\u0027d just by chance found the road again and walked until he found a house with a light on. There\u0027d been no gain from the failed commission of that crime, and that\u0027s why Rich and Brogan are at it again so soon, in this parking lot at dawn, saying good morning to Tim Kern.\u000A\u000ABrogan says he hangs back while Rich does the interfacing with Tim. Rich gets jocular and street-preachery, and Tim yields. It is in keeping with Tim\u0027s character. He is closing in on 50 years old and recently unemployed—he\u0027d been working nights cleaning Speedway parking lots with these big Zamboni-like machines until he was recently downsized. He has a history of being a burner and a loafer and a dude who loves classic rock. He is the divorced father of three boys. Tina, his ex-wife, a cocktail waitress at the Winking Lizard Tavern, still loves Tim, but she couldn\u0027t take being married to him anymore. It was like having another kid. In the most recent photographs, his face reveals an almost boyish guilelessness that doesn\u0027t age super well. Brogan thinks he seems sweet. Today he wears this black baseball hat that he can\u0027t seem to put on straight.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHoles in the Woods: Rich wasn\u0027t partial to physical labor, so Brogan did the digging. Photo: Courtesy of the Ohio Attorney General\u0027s Office, BCI\u000A\u000AThe first fucked-up thing Brogan notices about the Tim Kern situation is the car. A Buick that can\u0027t operate at speeds over thirty miles per hour. This is the big payday Rich has been hoping for? A car you can\u0027t even drive on the highway? There is no question about Tim taking it down to the \u0022farm\u0022—they\u0027ll take Brogan\u0027s car. And then there\u0027s the stuff. Tim is living in his car, at this point. All he has are garbage bags filled with clothes and keepsakes, a few pictures of his family, and a soiled ream of personal documents of the type you see the itinerant clutching outside government offices everywhere.\u000A\u000ABefore they get into the car, Rich starts telling Tim which of his things he\u0027ll need down on the farm and what he should come back to pick up later. Take this, leave that. A toolbox, a believable amount of clothes, so Tim will think he\u0027s really going somewhere. Brogan, as the muscle, grapples the TV into his trunk. It\u0027s not even a flat-screen. Why does Rich want this TV? What kind of vetting process could Rich have done on this guy? Whatever slim margin of logic they\u0027ve been operating on, robbing and killing men who were themselves almost destitute, now it\u0027s out the window. Rich asks Tim how much cash he has on him to get by with down on the farm, and Tim gets all sheepish and says: Five bucks.\u000A\u000AWhile it\u0027s still dark, the three of them drive out of that parking lot and into the still-somnolent morning for what is supposed to be an hour-and-a-half drive to Caldwell. Rich and Brogan up front, with Tim in the back, like a kid.\u000A\u000ARich keeps the patter up. He was always good like that. Brogan often remarked inwardly about how weird some of the stuff Rich talked to these men about was. Rich would always take them out for breakfast on the way to the farm, the big magnanimous boss guy. When they were eating breakfast with David Pauley just before they killed him, Rich told this long story about a friend of his who looked like Kenny Rogers, and when they\u0027d go out to eat, Rich would let it slip to the waiter that it really was Kenny Rogers and they\u0027d all eat for free. Today, Tim Kern seems affable in the face of Rich\u0027s small-talk fusillade, kind of dazy and trying to act professional around his new employer.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Courtesy of writer\u000A\u000A\u0022Chaplain Rich\u0022 allegedly ran a prostitution ring out of the so-called halfway house (above), he operated in Akron.\u000A\u000AWhat the Craigslist job offered Tim was an unforeseen opportunity: an actual grown-up life. Instant adulthood, including a place to live where his sons—they were grown, but he called them his \u0022babies\u0022—could come visit, a setup that lately seemed beyond him to puzzle out. Still, Tim did not exactly go gladly into this adventure. He\u0027d been anxious yesterday, wringing his hands, telling his boys he didn\u0027t want to leave them, staying up all night packing at Tina\u0027s house—he still used it as kind of a home base for showering and the keeping of important items. He was trying to seem laid-back about it, but he felt pretty adrift, heading out that morning to go live by himself on a farm in southern Ohio.\u000A\u000ABefore they get too far, Rich leans back and says, Hey man, turns out we were hunting for squirrels out by the old Rolling Acres Mall the other day. And you know what? I lost my watch. It\u0027s got a lot of sentimental value. Do you mind if we go over to the woods and look for it real quick before we head down to the farm? And Tim says, No, I don\u0027t mind.\u000A\u000AGranted, maybe Rich and Tim live in a world where it\u0027s not totally implausible to have been hunting squirrels in the Akron suburbs. But it was still a weird thing to say. This overly companionable aging biker type and his darkly silent \u0022nephew\u0022 pick you up to drive you down to your new job on a farm, but first, at six in the morning, they want to root around the woods for a watch—a watch!—they lost shooting at urban rodents the other day? But what would you say if you were Tim? One thing about humans is that they will put up with all but the most absurd and alarming events once they\u0027ve signed on to a situation. There is in fact a moment when the teenage girl could jump out at the stoplight once she starts to get the smell of bad magic on the guy who said he\u0027d give her a lift home, when the homeowner could close the door on the man at the front steps whose face isn\u0027t composed right at all. But if you don\u0027t bail right away, chances are you will be along for the entire ride, however windy and gruesome and never-ending it turns out to be. We\u0027ve all done it: taken the cab even though the driver seems weird, gotten on the plane even though that guy in the trench coat is sweating and talking to himself, stayed in a situation even though some tingly instinct is telling you to flee. And what you\u0027ve learned from those experiences is that it always, always works out. Trust is how Craigslist works in the first place. The shocking thing isn\u0027t that the occasional bad actor on Craigslist shows up and takes advantage of that trust. The shocking thing about Craigslist is that it almost never happens.\u000A\u000ATim Kern will not make it down to Caldwell today. He is not going to a desolate parcel of former strip-mining land carefully selected because it seemed like it might actually need a caretaker and because you can\u0027t hear a gunshot from the nearest house. Tim Kern will never get farther than the scrub woods around an abandoned suburban shopping mall. This criminal enterprise is rapidly devolving, the standards lowering from a kind of wannabe Hollywood film about professional hit men into a haphazard, tragically absurd killing spree. We know now that it will be over in a week. But to Brogan it seems like it could go on and on and on and on. When he talks about it now, he says he was living in a state of total acquiescence. A surrender to what he calls darkness. The entire period suffused with a thick matter that fundamentally transformed all things, from the food he ate to the people he talked to, into some kind of intolerable simulacra that tasted of metal and death.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhen I meet Brogan last fall at the Warren Correctional Institution, he\u0027s 18 years old and still looks older than he is. He wears his hair slicked back with product, comb marks visible, and a small trimmed mustache. He is fastidious, immaculate, his navy prison pajamas neat and creased. He does push-ups on his knuckles every morning, part of a fully regimented and scheduled day he once described in a letter: \u0022After returning from breakfast, I do my hygiene—brush my teeth, etc. After that I try to straighten up the cell: make my bed, make coffee, fix the stuff on the floor…\u0022 Two years ago, he had never even been in the back of a police car. Now, in the early days of a life sentence with no possibility of parole, he has already come to inhabit the persona of the old professorial prisoner who approaches life inside with a quiet, philosophical asceticism.\u000A\u000A\u0022No one knows how old I am in here because I\u0027m old-school,\u0022 he tells me. \u0022I carry myself as if I were older. I look like I\u0027m midtwenties. Plus, they all think I\u0027m this crazy killer. This serial killer. So they steer clear of me.\u0022\u000A\u000ABrogan thanks me for coming, even though he gives the impression that he would rather be alone and is doing this because his father told him to. (Both Brogan and Rich are appealing their verdicts.) He refuses my offers of food and drink but eventually agrees to allow me to buy him a black coffee. He expresses disdain for the prisoners here who aren\u0027t like that: \u0022People in jail, they come around asking for coffee or food or whatnot,\u0022 he says. \u0022No sense of shame, even if they don\u0027t know you at all. I would never do that. I would rather go without.\u0022\u000A\u000AWe sit across a short table from each other over the course of two days. I knew he was going to be a quiet kid, but the way he\u0027s quiet is different. When I ask if he once loved Richard Beasley, the pause is so long, Brogan gazing kind of inwardly in the midst of the heartbreaking human calamity that is the visitors\u0027 room—shackled men with face ink and cornrows holding their newborn babies, old moms wheeling oxygen tanks to buy their only sons a microwavable calzone—that I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m waiting for an answer or this is his way of saying \u0022Pass.\u0022 But it\u0027s not the desperate quietude of someone who wants to connect and can\u0027t figure out how. It\u0027s an almost imperturbable sense of independence. Brogan is, and always was, a priori different, is how he sees it. He\u0027s not like me, he\u0027s not like the kids in his high school class, he\u0027s not like the man shackled with the neck ink, he has never been like anyone ever except maybe his dad and his mom, though both of them were always at distances so permanently untraversable that he couldn\u0027t know for sure if he was like them or not. He has never really needed other people. (This is convenient, because he has never had anyone he could safely need.)\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Karen Schiely/Akron Beacon Journal/AP Photo\u000A\u000A\u0022Chaplain Rich\u0022 is shown here with Brogan in a restaurant surveillance video, getting a bite before an attempted murder.\u000A\u000AThe first time I met Mike Rafferty, Brogan\u0027s dad, he was in his garage listening to Deep Purple, \u0022Smoke on the Water,\u0022 lifting weights on a quiet afternoon in his three-bedroom suburban ranch. Early fifties, small in stature, I\u0027d guess five feet eight inches, built almost in a square, a Rubik\u0027s Cube of flesh, with a long dark ponytail, a prominent forehead, a small expressionless mouth, and shiny dark eyes framed out by the longest, most beautiful, dark eyelashes that give a poignancy to the latent violence he exudes. It\u0027s like My Little Pony was a 53-year-old biker from the rust belt of Akron. He is a machinist by trade, works nights precision-cutting metal for aircraft landing gear, and, yes, is the president and a member in good and legendary standing of the North Coast motorcycle club, a close affiliate of the Hells Angels. According to police, North Coast is suspected of dealing in meth, but Mike has no criminal record, save for a public-urination charge, and strikes me, while he sits on his sofa in jean shorts and a tank top, as a straight arrow who does not suffer fools gladly or without punching them in the face.\u000A\u000A\u0022Maybe I wasn\u0027t the kind of father I should have been,\u0022 he says. \u0022I wasn\u0027t real good at showing emotion, and I was a bit of a disciplinarian.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe kind of father he was: the kind who buys a small house in a good school district, teaches his kid to box in the garage starting when he\u0027s 5; who didn\u0027t drink on weeknights but spent Fridays at \u0022church\u0022 (the weekly meeting of North Coast) and most of the weekend at bars; who, Brogan says, once broke the boy\u0027s nose over a missing report card; who Rich and Brogan and Yvette, Brogan\u0027s mother, all agree was a good provider but terrified Brogan. From Mike, Brogan learned what Mike saw as that most important tool: self-reliance. To be able to take care of yourself in a fight, to get yourself to school, to keep a straight house and get good grades, to understand never to make excuses or dwell on how hard it all is. Up until that November, Mike saw himself as a biker-machinist dad who was doing a pretty good job raising a boy more or less on his own. It was a stable place to live, but not a home that allowed for certain parts of being a kid: like admitting that you\u0027re weak, and you don\u0027t have the answers, and that circumstances can arise that you simply cannot be expected to take care of by yourself.\u000A\u000ABrogan\u0027s mother, on the other hand, is an addict. Over time, he\u0027d reduced his relationship with her to the smallest unit of parenting she could handle: Brogan told Yvette she could go on a crack binge—because no matter what she promised, she was going to go on a crack binge anyway—she just couldn\u0027t do it on the weekends Brogan was with her. But he couldn\u0027t rely on even that.\u000A\u000AI met Yvette for dinner this past winter. Yvette was a biker chick from the first time she ever got on the back of a motorcycle. \u0022I was hot as shit, I ain\u0027t gonna lie,\u0022 she told me over steak at TGI Fridays. \u0022Hair down to my ass. I was hot.\u0022\u000A\u000ABy all accounts this description of Yvette Rafferty is accurate. She arrived in northern Ohio from out of the American South as a woman from a dream issue of Easyriders magazine, skinny and willowy, with hair spun from ice cream and sunshine and a taste for denim and leather. She liked to party, and she was crazy, too. She once rode a big old dirt bike that belonged to a Mexican all the way back from Daytona Beach while the bike\u0027s owner leaned back and slept against the luggage rack. And she ain\u0027t never even rode a dirt bike before! She met Mike when she was working at a bikini bar. That was not long before she became addicted to cocaine. She says she was sober while she was pregnant. But Brogan wasn\u0027t 3 days old when she disappeared into a crack house with him still swaddled in a hospital blanket. Mike took Brogan away after that, and they separated. She still seems like kind of a love mama, even though a good chunk of her humanity appears to have disappeared into addiction. She is a hug person, a kiss person, a person who loves to cry, the type of hippie biker chick who\u0027d want to sleep with all her babies in a big family bed but also bungee them to a chopper for a ride to get formula. But in reality she is now a 49-year-old woman who has to remove her new dentures before she eats a TGI Fridays steak with Jack Daniel\u0027s sauce. Who, after two beers, starts shivering and loses the gift of coherent speech for long stretches and tries to eat a wet nap off her plate. Sits there chewing it like lettuce until I reach into her toothless mouth before she can swallow it. Brogan has known before memory that his mother is an addict. When he was 10, he found evidence on the Internet that she\u0027d prostituted herself. The really terrible moments of my dinner with her came when she admitted knowing what she\u0027d become. Her face crumpled and she said: \u0022I know all this is my fault. I know it is. If I hadn\u0027t have been an addict, none of this would have happened.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022To me, he was just death,\u0022 Brogan tells me. \u0022When I thought of him, it was death.\u0022\u000A\u000ARich was death incarnate?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yes.\u0022\u000A\u000ARich must have known, somehow, that Brogan could handle living through that darkness without imploding. It was Rich\u0027s gift to see potential where others do not, where most people would not want to look for potential. Rich was almost blinded by the opportunities he saw—like growing weed or making moonshine or faking a raffle or trading on the inherent advantages of running a \u0022halfway house\u0022 in the hood—in a way that seemed to make normal opportunity almost invisible to him. What Mike, Brogan\u0027s dad, used to say about Rich was that he\u0027d rather make a crooked nickel than an honest dollar. It was the kind of thing you could say right to Rich\u0027s face and he\u0027d laugh about it. Mike says Rich once asked him if he\u0027d like to rob a bank. Which Mike most certainly didn\u0027t want to do. But those were the kinds of things kicking around in Rich\u0027s head.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s my theory that Rich saw in Brogan a kind of potential that Brogan was probably unaware of. Rich knew Mike from the world of Akron bikers, and Yvette from a life that brought him into the drug houses and jails of Akron, and he knew Brogan. This hulking castoff of a kid, who strangers thought was possibly mute but confidants knew as a preternaturally sardonic kid who acted like a full-grown man but was probably hiding a stunted little baby somewhere inside, like a worm larva in the middle of an apple. I\u0027m not saying that Rich became friends with Brogan when he was 9 as part of a long con. Rich probably started taking Brogan to church because it felt like a good Christian thing to do. Rich seemed to genuinely enjoy hanging out with Brogan, tooling around Akron, visiting historic graveyards and dropping general world knowledge. And in the bargain Brogan, according to the amateur psychology of pretty much everyone who came into contact with them, got a dad who wasn\u0027t a hard-ass, who took him around and treated him like an equal, but who also understood (without judgment) the world where his mom came from, a secret he didn\u0027t much share with his friends from school. Yvette describes Brogan\u0027s feelings this way: \u0022Brogan was ashamed of me, but he loved me.\u0022 Rich was kind of like Brogan himself—they both straddled the straight world and the world of the street. And when the time came, Rich knew what Brogan\u0027s skill set might be, knew how to activate it, and he apparently didn\u0027t hesitate.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AIn the summer of 2011, before they lured that first man, Ralph Geiger, down to southern Ohio, Rich had a conversation with Brogan. There was going to be a warrant out for Rich\u0027s arrest. And if they got him, he said, they were going to put him away for a crime he didn\u0027t commit. So he was going to go on the run. This news lit in Brogan an incandescent bloom of indignation that in the mind of a 16-year-old can glow so much more purely than in people like you or me. The damn cops, he knew about them, they messed with his mother.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, he had told me this story about how they were going to put him in jail over some old stuff that he didn\u0027t do,\u0022 Brogan says. \u0022I was angry. I was angry. It didn\u0027t seem right.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut then, when the murders began, it couldn\u0027t have been just about that anger anymore. Whatever compelled Brogan to help Rich, it had to have become something else. Brogan says now that he did what Rich said because Rich threatened him. He told Brogan: I know where your mother lives. I know where your sister lives. He would check on Brogan every day, call him, have him meet up. Brogan says that every time he dug a hole, he expected that he might end up in it. This explanation seems too simple to me, but Brogan\u0027s is the only narrative we have about these events.\u000A\u000AThreatened or not, Brogan trudged on. Like a golem. Made of clay by his master, animate but not awake to his humanity. To be there and not really be there, the way he is when we are at the Warren Correctional Institution, that was what Brogan could do better than just about anyone. I would say that Brogan\u0027s greatest skill as accomplice in a crime of massively gruesome proportions is to be able to locate himself fathoms beneath the emotional sea even when he\u0027s right beside you.\u000A\u000ADoes Rich see himself as a man attuned to the potential lurking in places other men would never look? I try to broach the topic when I meet him on death row. I ask about the warrant that had been out for his arrest, which was for, essentially, running a prostitution ring—twenty women, one male—out of his \u0022halfway\u0022 house. A prostitution ring staffed by the women he ministered to. The women for whom he\u0027d stood up in court to promise judges that, as counselor and halfway-house proprietor, he\u0027d look after them. The women he\u0027d visit in jail, talk on jailhouse phones with, and describe his physical longing for in conversations the authorities were recording. By most accounts, his favorite had been a 17-year-old girl named Savannah, who died of an overdose. Brogan knew her as Rich\u0027s girlfriend.\u000A\u000AI tell Rich that I interviewed one of these women, Amy Saller. She told me, I say, that you did try to get her off drugs, in a way. She said you had devised your own detox system: three rocks one day, and then two for each of the next couple of days, and then down to one. But it never worked. So you\u0027d just buy her the rocks and let her smoke them at your place. She thought your biggest fear was that she would leave, and you wanted her near you. Sure, you wanted to trick with her sometimes, but she seemed to feel she had you in her back pocket. She knew she could steal from you and you might yell and scream, but you weren\u0027t going to get violent. She said you put her up as an escort on Backpage and took a commission on the money she made. It was strange that Amy, whom you pimped out, who has in the intervening months gotten sober and is working at Red Lobster now and has earned the right to visit her kid, talks as if she isn\u0027t totally sure who was using whom. When I ask you about all of the above, your answer is only: \u0022Amy Saller. I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t know who that is.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd about the notion of those physical longings and the like: \u0022I haven\u0027t been able to have sex since I had my car accident,\u0022 Rich tells me. He\u0027s referring to an accident he had about eight years ago. \u0022I had a steel coffee cup in my lap when it happened.\u0022 He smiles mischievously here and slits his eyes like a cat. \u0022You can\u0027t use what you don\u0027t have.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd then, thinking about it, he gets a little more grandiose. \u0022I think it was a blessing from God that I wasn\u0027t able to have sex. If I could, it might have complicated the relationship I had with all those women. I might have been tempted. But as it was, I was able to remain pure.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOn the way to the Rolling Acres Mall, Tim mentions that he likes Brogan\u0027s Buick. Rich has a plan for Tim\u0027s car: He and Brogan will come back with some blowtorches and scrap the car themselves for cash. Rich will take the cash and give Tim a Ford F-150. A more appropriate vehicle for the terrain down on the farm. Tim will pay off the difference in installments that will come out of his wages. It\u0027s almost as if Rich enjoys spinning out these scenarios, a natural outgrowth of the fecundity of his scheming brain—he\u0027s got the gift, so why not just share it with the world?\u000A\u000ARolling Acres is Chernobyl-y, with its cheerful awnings inviting you to condemned movie theaters and the now removed names of big-box stores silhouetted onto the brickwork of its entrances. The mall was built in the \u002770s and expanded in the \u002780s, and now, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, is home to only a single JCPenney outlet store that will itself soon be shuttered. They pull around an outbuilding and park near the woods.\u000A\u000AWhen they brought men to \u0022the farm,\u0022 Rich had a trick he\u0027d pull. He\u0027d walk in front of the subjects right away and let them follow him down one of the tracks into the forest. Having a stranger walking behind you into the woods tends to raise defenses. And then at some point—like in Scott Davis\u0027s case, when they were looking for some construction equipment they couldn\u0027t find—there\u0027d be an excuse to turn around. And just like that, the subject would be out in front. That\u0027s when Rich would shoot him in the head without the victim ever knowing what happened, Brogan says. It was the beauty of Rich\u0027s method that he never had to lay a hand on anyone, never had to overpower a body—he simply had to pick the right people and then be the guy in charge.\u000A\u000AAnd now they are in the woods, looking for this \u0022watch.\u0022 Rich pulls back a branch and lets it slap back at Brogan and Tim. Then Tim holds it back for Brogan so he can walk by. This act of kindness disturbs Brogan, though he doesn\u0027t say anything.\u000A\u000ARich and Tim walk together, looking. Brogan acts like he\u0027s searching the thick November leaf layer a few yards away. Brogan says he hears a pop. When he turns, he sees that Tim is down on his knees and Rich has the .22 in his hand. Tim\u0027s holding the side of his head. And then Rich says, \u0022Are you all right?\u0022 Like he\u0027s concerned Tim\u0027s hurt himself. But when Tim doesn\u0027t respond, Rich shoots him again, and again, and again, and Tim slumps over onto his side. There\u0027s something wrong with the gun, Rich is saying. And it hits Brogan then that Tim is still breathing. All of these events, Brogan says, they blend together—maybe because he has a powerful reluctance to go back over them or because he dissociates even right there in the moment. But this whole debacle is beyond the pale, horrific in an absurd, intolerable way to Brogan. This man has nothing worth stealing, there is no reason to kill him. And now he won\u0027t die. Rich gets up close and shoots him a last time, in the face. Now Tim is lying on the ground, eyes open wide and staring at the leafless branches above. Every few seconds he takes a big, audible gulp of air, like a dying fish. He\u0027s still alive, Brogan says, he\u0027s still alive. Rich says no. No way. His brain is dead, there are four bullets in his head and I put one between his eyes.\u000A\u000AIt stops eventually, the desperate, drowning sounds. Then Rich says to grab a leg and takes the other one himself. And together they drag Tim to the hole. It\u0027s only two feet deep, and Tim doesn\u0027t completely fit in there. But Rich doesn\u0027t seem to care. He removes Tim\u0027s jacket and cuts the shirt off with a pair of scissors. That black hat he kicks to the side—it\u0027s covered in blood.\u000A\u000AWhy? Brogan says he asks Rich. Why did we do this, he didn\u0027t have anything. Rich has his own logic about it: Well, he was a dead man as soon as he got in the car. As if it had been out of their hands.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Karen Schiely/Akron Beacon Journal/AP Photo\u000A\u000ARichard Beasley.\u000A\u000AThe first time, with Ralph Geiger, they removed all the clothes, covered him with lime, replaced the ground cover so you could have walked right over the grave and you wouldn\u0027t have suspected anything. For David Pauley, they had changes of boots, gloves; Rich had even put a $20 bill next to the hole so they\u0027d know if anyone saw the hole in the interim. But by the time they got to Tim… Well, Tim is still in his pants and shoes and socks. Brogan isn\u0027t even finished backfilling the hole when Rich tells him to stop. It\u0027s getting light out now. Rich is ready to get out of here. He starts kicking some leaves over the hole.\u000A\u000AThis would be the last murder. Scott Davis had gotten away. And he talked to the police. Right now, as Brogan and Rich are at the mall, the FBI is tracing the Craigslist ad back to Rich\u0027s IP address, and later to a camera at a Shoney\u0027s in Marietta, Ohio, that snapped a picture of Brogan and Rich as they walked in to meet Scott Davis the morning he was shot. Three days from now, agents will show up at Stow high school and pull Brogan from class. He will still have the TV in his trunk. He and Rich won\u0027t even have scrapped Tim\u0027s car yet—there will have been functionally zero financial or other gain from the murder of Tim Kern. The same day Brogan is arrested, a SWAT team will pick up Rich outside the house where he rented the room. There will be a helicopter and everything.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s getting lighter out as they drive back from Rolling Acres. Rich has Brogan stop at McDonald\u0027s for breakfast. Rich likes McDonald\u0027s because of the free Internet. Brogan says they don\u0027t speak. Rich taps on his computer, and Brogan watches the street outside as the day gets brighter. He drops Rich at his place and heads for his mom\u0027s. When he\u0027s pulling up the hill toward home, he gets a call from Yvette on his cell. She\u0027s crying. A man she knows—the guy she calls her \u0022millionaire maniac,\u0022 a \u0022famous\u0022 dog breeder, known for his prize German shepherds, who likes to party—had been an asshole last night, and now she is walking home. Brogan doesn\u0027t say much, just that he\u0027ll pick her up on the way home. She\u0027s still crying when she gets into the passenger seat. This is one of those periodic moments of clarity for her, when she can see plainly what the dynamic is with her son, Brogan being the stable one, the guy who comes to the rescue. I\u0027m sorry I wasn\u0027t there last night, she says, I didn\u0027t know you were coming over this weekend, I swear. Brogan stops her. It doesn\u0027t matter, Mom. It really doesn\u0027t matter.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AA few months before I go to Chillicothe to meet Rich, I have breakfast with Carol Beasley, Rich\u0027s mom, at a bakery near her house. She is a kind woman in a cute Christmas sweater who is befuddled by her own cell phone and is more worried about the weather for my flight back to New York than I am. Carol tells me that she doesn\u0027t want to fool herself. Richard probably did the things they say he did. Though she can\u0027t help slipping into the framework Rich has provided her for these events—the inconsistencies, the suggestion of plots underlying the apparent facts. \u0022But why did Scott Davis make the ambulance take him to Akron General hospital, which is right by the motorcycle club?\u0022 she asks me. \u0022He literally had to pass several other hospitals on his way there. And why did Scott refuse to talk to the police for days?\u0022\u000A\u000AWe have a philosophical conversation about how, even if she pretty much knows the truth, she won\u0027t really be able to process it until Rich admits it. I tell her that I\u0027ve exchanged some letters with him in advance of our meeting. I told him I was hoping that he would be able to fully open up, to come clean. No one will really know what happened until he does. My guess is that it won\u0027t change the facts. But it seems impossible to understand this whole saga without knowing the truth from Rich—why he decided to do this, what he thought as he slept in the same hotel room with Ralph Geiger the night before he murdered him.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Phil Masturzo/Akron Beacon Journal/AP Photo\u000A\u000ASurviving Prison: \u0022I carry myself as if I were older,\u0022 says Brogan, pictured here in court with his mom, Yvette.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s also true that there are things we don\u0027t know about Brogan. He claims he participated in these crimes because Rich overtly threatened him. I think it\u0027s also possible that Brogan participated because he thought he needed to be a man. But even if Brogan is lying about the threats, even if he believes that he did this of his own free will, I think it was still, functionally, coercion. These murder-robberies benefited only one person: Richard Beasley. There was some discussion at the trial about how Brogan received treasure from these men: David Pauley\u0027s shotgun, etc. But that fact strikes me more like, for instance, an uncle who has molested his nephew and then buys him anything he wants at the toy store, and in so doing binds all kinds of incompatible emotions (shame, guilt, pleasure, terror, pain) into a terrible cocktail that can never be unmid. Regardless, I tell Carol that morning that I hope Rich can tell the whole truth, because it\u0027s the only possible way to take even a fractional step toward making amends.\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh,\u0022 Carol Beasley says, the shiny tinsel threads in her sweater throwing plasticky sparks beneath the recessed lighting, \u0022I don\u0027t think so. He doesn\u0027t want anyone to know the real him. He never has. He\u0027s too ashamed. He will never, ever do that.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd she was right. The moment he sat down across the table from me, with that twinkle in his eye, Rich began telling magnificent stories. Ralph Geiger had been down in Caldwell, \u0022pounding nails\u0022 for work, when he came across a meth lab he shouldn\u0027t have seen, and the meth dealers had to walk him out into the woods and kill him. Brogan murdered Tim Kern himself, with an accomplice, as a way to earn his colors in the North Coast motorcycle club. Rich seemed to understand that some of this was hard to believe, and so he didn\u0027t gild the lily. When we came to a fact that didn\u0027t make sense, he made like the two of us were trying to piece this whole mystery together, but he could only help me so much. \u0022I don\u0027t know,\u0022 he\u0027d say, staring off at a section of floor fifteen feet away, as if examining some mysterious half-human creature who\u0027d been following him at this distance for quite some time. \u0022That\u0027s what I\u0027m trying to figure out. I don\u0027t know.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut he did not confess to a thing. Near the end of our conversations, I ask him a little bit about religion. Because it would seem that this failure to come clean would probably have some ramifications with God, if Rich happened to believe in God.\u000A\u000AHow is it a fellow gets to heaven?\u000A\u000A\u0022I believe you will go to heaven if you accept Jesus Christ into your heart as your savior.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou don\u0027t have to confess to anyone?\u000A\u000A\u0022You have to confess to God and ask forgiveness. Do you know the story of King David? You\u0027re of Jewish descent, right? He killed a man and had an adulterous affair. And he was the apple of God\u0027s eye.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s it? Confess to God and then you\u0027re in heaven?\u000A\u000AHe nodded. That\u0027s it.\u000A\u000AHe asked one more thing, though, at the end of our visit. Please ask people to write me, he said. I may be able to counsel them in their lives. And if I could communicate with men outside these walls, he said, it would make me feel free, too.\u000A\u000ADevin Friedman (@devinfriedman)  is GQ\u0027s director of editorial projects.",

ad:<em> Wanted: a caretaker for a remote piece of Appalachian farmland. Housing provided. Bring all your own possessions.</em> More than a hundred men applied; four were hired. The preacher and his &quot;nephew&quot; offered each a ride down to the farm. The men never knew what was going on—what bizarre scheme they&#39;d stumbled upon. What happened next was almost too terrible to believe</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.0">It is November, and 5 a.m. feels like winter. As he has on many mornings these past four months of 2011, Brogan Rafferty, age 16, wakes up early to help his friend and mentor, Rich Beasley, on an errand of Rich&#x2019;s design. Brogan doesn&#x2019;t need to pick up Rich until 6, but unlike your typical teenager, Brogan likes to get up early and drink coffee in the morning so he has some time to himself before he leaves the house. Today they are going to pick up a man named Timothy Kern, age 47, who will be waiting for them in a strip-mall parking lot with all his earthly possessions. Like the three men who preceded him on this grim adventure, Tim answered an ad on Craigslist that said: <em>We need someone to watch our farm down in southern Ohio. Live for free in a double-wide trailer, nothing in the way of duties except to take in the peacefulness of the countryside and remark on the changing of the seasons and make sure no one steals any farm equipment or perpetrates any mischief.</em> The pay is $300 a week.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1">Brogan pulls up in front of Rich&#x2019;s with plenty of time and throws his Buick into park. Rich comes lumbering across the front lawn, expelling steamy breath into the dark Akron morning, and deposits himself into the front seat. Brogan says nothing, as is his habit. Brogan is a junior of middling academic record at Stow-Munroe Falls High School, remarkable to his peers and teachers mostly for being such a giant of a human being. Six feet five inches, close to 230 pounds, and not finished growing yet. He&#x2019;s a laconic character, polite but suspicious of authority, prematurely world-weary with an easily inflamed sense of injustice and an almost pathological ability to keep his own counsel. The agenda today can&#x2019;t be a big mystery to Brogan. After all, he was the one who dug the hole yesterday out at a plot of neglected suburban scrubland near the old Rolling Acres Mall&#x2014;about yay wide and yay deep and big enough for an adult male body. Rich, not being partial to manual labor, had watched. As they pull out onto the road, Brogan wills himself not to think about what he and Rich will be doing this morning.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2">Richard Beasley: age 52, former convict, motorcycle enthusiast, professed man of God, known on the Akron street as Chaplain Rich. He&#x2019;d started taking Brogan to church when Brogan was just 9 years old and already almost comically large and serious and quiet. Since then Rich has become probably Brogan&#x2019;s best friend, his uncle-dad, his guide to the Gospels of the Bible and the affairs of the teenage heart, to the mysteries of Akron and the even deeper mysteries of Brogan&#x2019;s own parents. Brogan calls him his <em>counselor.</em></p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.3">The enterprise that will bring them to Tim Kern began in August, in the dead of summer. Rich had discovered that there was a warrant out for his arrest, the product of a twenty-month investigation into the goings-on at a halfway house he operated. If he were arrested, he could very well spend the rest of his life in prison. And so Rich began to target men like Tim. At first because he needed a new identity, and later to provide a kind of income to support a life on the run.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.5">It&#x2019;s like Rich&#x2019;s Craigslist ad was designed for a certain kind of person: male, white, unattached, aging, no longer fostering unreasonable ambitions or fueled by fantasies about what he might turn out to be someday, someone on the downward slope of life for whom things maybe haven&#x2019;t gone exactly as planned. It is sort of a retirement plan for the obsolete white man. In the industrial northeast of Ohio at the far side of the Great Recession, there is no shortage of these people. Rich has actually been interviewing subjects he carefully selects from the hundreds of men who reply to the ads. He&#x2019;s been showing up at the food court of the Chapel Hill mall with an official-looking application form, affecting the air of an affable blue-collar-type landowner who just wants to find someone friendly to camp out on his spread while he&#x2019;s up in Akron conducting the business of his normal life. Rich ascertains certain things from these gentlemen: <em>Do you have a wife or kids or people you need to keep in close touch with? This farm, it doesn&#x2019;t have cell coverage; are you a fellow who can live in peaceful isolation? And what type of vehicle do you have, and would you be bringing that down with you when you came, and oh, there&#x2019;s a laptop computer? Bring it all with you, and my nephew and I will drive you on down to Caldwell.</em></p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.6">Rich tells Brogan to get off the highway at an exit in the town of Canton. He says that Tim Kern is waiting in his car not too far from there. Brogan is quiet, as always. People tend to make assumptions about you when you are huge and so quiet you could be mistaken for mute. But Brogan is also observant. Rich smells this morning of bar soap and, beneath that, something fetid. Brogan notices he&#x2019;s wearing the same clothes as yesterday, and he wonders whether these are now the only clothes Rich has. Rich has always been a rumpled character, a corpulent man in denim and leather and boots, with long white hair he wears in a balding grandmother&#x2019;s braid. But one of Rich&#x2019;s life principles is to maintain a bright hygienic line between him and the street people he ministers to. His message: <em>I live among you by choice; I can leave if I want</em>. But by November of 2011, near the end of Richard Beasley&#x2019;s run, things are falling apart on both the bodily maintenance and criminal mastermind fronts. Rich has been dyeing his hair as part of his new identity, but now the filmy silver roots have grown out. He&#x2019;s abandoned his house and is now living on the east side of Akron in a rented room that doesn&#x2019;t even have a door you can close.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.7"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583069009f0bee56440e5b5/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-02.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069009f0bee56440e5b5%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-02.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069009f0bee56440e5b5%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-02.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.8">A Tale of Two Dads: Mike Rafferty <em>(left)</em>, with his son, Brogan, was a better but ultimately less formative father figure than Richard Beasley <em>(right)</em>.

A more profound and disturbing desperation, if it&#x2019;s possible to vibe more profoundly disturbing than this whole thing has been from the start. In less than a month, Brogan will deliver a series of lengthy confessions to the FBI about the elaborately planned but almost logic-defying crimes he and Rich committed together. If you listen to the confessions carefully, they begin to sound different when Brogan starts describing this morning&#x2019;s events with Tim Kern. Throughout most of the hours of his statements, Brogan maintains a tone of almost stolid impassivity, sounding like someone who&#x2019;d merely watched a series of killings on a strange unmarked videotape he received in the mail&#x2014;what happened was awful, certainly, but concerned events that had nothing to do with him. But when he talks about Tim, it&#x2019;s like things won&#x2019;t stay psychologically tamped down. It&#x2019;s as if whatever mental box he&#x2019;d built to house these events so they would be out of sight, on this day that box comes unsealed and everything hidden there spills out.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.a">There is a surveillance camera in the parking lot where Tim Kern is waiting in his 1995 Buick LeSabre. Footage from that camera will indicate it is five minutes after 6 A.M. on that morning of Sunday November 13, 2011, when Rich and Brogan arrive to get him.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.b"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.c">It is hard not to like Rich Beasley right away. When I first see him, sitting in navy prison pants in the visitors&#x2019; hall at Chillicothe Correctional Institution, which is situated in farmlands south of Columbus that are on this winter day frozen into a lifeless meringue, he stands and greets me with a commiserating smile that says: <em>Can you believe it, the world is so fucked up, but did we really expect anything different</em>? His hand is an old overboiled ham hock that envelops mine in a shake. He is large, with a fulsome white goatee and an untrimmed mustache that covers the absence of front teeth and works as a kind of flap behind which bites of microwave cheeseburger disappear as a dog disappears into a flap in a back door. He has lively, kind of almondy-shaped blue eyes that do not shy from contact and don&#x2019;t seem to have a thing in the world to hide. They might be said to have a mischievous twinkle. The hairs of the eyebrows are unruly and backward-reaching. He looks like the Grinch, or at least a little like he was drawn by a cartoonist.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.d">&quot;I have to admit I don&#x2019;t get <em>GQ</em> magazine,&quot; he says. &quot;I get <em>Easyriders</em> magazine and something called <em>Armchair General,</em> about military history. I also read <em>The Week</em> cover to cover every week.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.e">It&#x2019;s here, in the old death-row visitors&#x2019; wing at Chillicothe, a vast empty hall surrounded by two stories of <em>Shawshank Redemption</em>-vintage cells, that we speak for a total of about eight hours over two days. It&#x2019;s easy to see that Rich was a preacher. The man has the gift of gab. But he&#x2019;s not what you&#x2019;d call silver-tongued. His talent in the sermonizing arena was never soaring oratory, more of a folksy sociability. He can talk knowledgeably about using a store-bought still to make moonshine and the origin and bylaws of the Hells Angels, as well as how right Jesus was when he said to give unto Caesar what was Caesar&#x2019;s. Rich says he always lived by the laws of God but that, when he went on the run from the law, he wasn&#x2019;t living by the laws of man and that&#x2019;s wrong, so shame on him.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.f">&quot;You seem like a guy people feel comfortable with,&quot; I tell him.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.g">He releases another commiserating grin, this one called <em>guilty as charged</em>. &quot;People say that,&quot; he replies.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.h">God has been the one constant in his life, he tells me, thanks to his mom.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;I accepted Jesus as my savior when I was 12 years old,&quot; he says. &quot;I was baptized then, and that&#x2019;s all the baptizing I needed, according to my religion.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.j">Rich&#x2019;s original and most defining role in Brogan&#x2019;s life was always: the guy who took him to church. First as a good-works type of deal and then because they were homeys. Rich did his ministering in the ghetto, but he and Brogan went to services at the Chapel, a giant evangelical church that looks not unlike an aging community college and serves thousands of mostly middle-class parishioners who don&#x2019;t fancy putting on airs when it comes to worship but value community and charity and Christ. Rich&#x2019;s mother, Carol, has been a member in good standing at the Chapel for forty years.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.k">&quot;I took him to church because he needed it,&quot; Rich says. &quot;It was the right thing to do.

Everyone thought they were a funny pair, Brogan and Rich. The little-boy giant and the aging former biker. They tried to get Brogan in with the kids his age, but he just preferred to be with the older folks.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.o">&quot;He was 9, but he looked 14,&quot; Nancy Wilson, one of the regular members of the Bible study, told me at a Panera Bread in Akron one morning last winter. &quot;Brogan was like a puppy. He was following Richard around.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.p">And Rich, on the other hand: &quot;Well, he maintained what you call the rough look. You know, the down-and-outer look,&quot; Nancy says. &quot;He was very disheveled, but he felt that gave him an &#x2019;in&#x2019; with the people he was ministering to.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.q">Nancy, and the whole Bible-study group, got to know Rich from the letters he sent his mom when he was doing some time in prison in the early 2000s. Carol would read the letters aloud, and then they&#x2019;d pray for him. They&#x2019;d heard, Nancy says, how he&#x2019;d gotten in trouble the first time, down in Texas, when he wasn&#x2019;t more than 25 years old. A series of robberies. Then a gun charge that he told everyone wasn&#x2019;t his fault, and a couple of other scrapes that he explained were really just misunderstandings. It did seem to Nancy that he spent a lot of his letters complaining about the bedding and the food and didn&#x2019;t say too many remorseful things, but the group was compassionate, because give the guy a break, he was in jail, after all. Plus, they&#x2019;d all do anything for Carol. She lived a real Christian life. There wasn&#x2019;t a thing she wouldn&#x2019;t do or give to help people.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.r">And after he got out, Rich really seemed to have found his way back to God. He&#x2019;d become a chaplain. Well, he hadn&#x2019;t technically been ordained, but he said he was training up. The group knew all about that halfway house he&#x2019;d started down on Yale Street, where he lived. There were some weird people who used to stay there, certainly. That one guy ended up being a sex offender. But these were Rich&#x2019;s people&#x2014;the downtrodden, the addicted, the half-wits, the streetwalkers, petty thieves, and wrecks of Akron. He lived among them.

In a city of this size, with a downtown of no more than a handful of city blocks, without even a proper ghetto, <em>the street</em> is small enough that it is mostly on a first-name basis with itself. And it&#x2019;s true that the street was on a first-name basis with Chaplain Rich. To hear Rich tell it (and a lot of his claims check out), he had ministered to them at the Hope Caf&#xE9;, where the streetwalkers would gather for some free coffee and four-color Jesus brochures; he had fed them from the food bank; he had delivered bread to the drunks at the bars so that even if they&#x2019;d boozed away their paycheck, they could come home with something for their families to eat. He conducted weekly Bible studies at his halfway house for the unwanted and forgotten and lived with them and tolerated their vices and their personality defects, their vomit and blood and urine, and endured what no other man could endure, and still had charity in his heart. That is the story he tells. And it&#x2019;s what Nancy Wilson and her husband, Dave, mostly believed.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.v">&quot;We overlooked things,&quot; Dave says now. &quot;Uh. Signals. We overlooked signals. They were there.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.w"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.x">There really is a plot of land down in Caldwell, just like Rich promised in the Craigslist ad. It technically belongs to a coal-mining company. It&#x2019;s beautiful in that corner of Ohio&#x2019;s Appalachia, the hillocks bunched up like geological bedcovers and frosted in woods. It feels like being back in what even people who have known no such simpler time refer to as a simpler time.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.y">If on this November morning you were to head out of Caldwell, up onto Rado ridge, past a couple of desolate houses, and turn onto Don Warner Road, you would find &quot;the farm.&quot; That road will drop you down into what people here call a &quot;holler,&quot; and if you stop midway down the hill and take the half-grown-over four-wheeler track, you would find a hole containing the body of one Ralph Geiger, naked and partly decomposed. Ralph Geiger being the name on Rich&#x2019;s driver&#x2019;s license and pill prescriptions these days. The body has been here since summer, when the leaves were green; now it sits beneath four feet of damp earth coursed by hunters out savoring the final days of bow-hunting season. If you left the four-wheeler track and traveled farther downhill to the wooded floor of the holler, you would find under two feet of dirt the body of David Pauley, who&#x2019;d answered the ad in October, when the leaves had begun to change. He&#x2019;d driven up from Virginia with a pickup and a U-Haul filled with model trains, NASCAR memorabilia, a shotgun. Maybe fifty feet away from David Pauley&#x2019;s body is a hole that Brogan had dug not much more than a week ago. It is empty except for several inches of rainwater&#x2014;it had been meant for the body of Scott Davis, who&#x2019;d answered the ad and decided to move all the way up from South Carolina. But with Scott something had apparently gone wrong with the gun. Rich had only been able to shoot Scott in the arm, and then Scott had taken off into the woods. Bleeding and cold, Scott hid in the underbrush for seven hours, until, after dark, he&#x2019;d just by chance found the road again and walked until he found a house with a light on. There&#x2019;d been no gain from the failed commission of that crime, and that&#x2019;s why Rich and Brogan are at it again so soon, in this parking lot at dawn, saying good morning to Tim Kern.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.z">Brogan says he hangs back while Rich does the interfacing with Tim. Rich gets jocular and street-preachery, and Tim yields. It is in keeping with Tim&#x2019;s character. He is closing in on 50 years old and recently unemployed&#x2014;he&#x2019;d been working nights cleaning Speedway parking lots with these big Zamboni-like machines until he was recently downsized. He has a history of being a burner and a loafer and a dude who loves classic rock. He is the divorced father of three boys. Tina, his ex-wife, a cocktail waitress at the Winking Lizard Tavern, still loves Tim, but she couldn&#x2019;t take being married to him anymore. It was like having another kid. In the most recent photographs, his face reveals an almost boyish guilelessness that doesn&#x2019;t age super well. Brogan thinks he seems sweet. Today he wears this black baseball hat that he can&#x2019;t seem to put on straight.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.10"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583069009f0bee56440e5c4/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-05.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-05.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069009f0bee56440e5c4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-05.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069009f0bee56440e5c4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-05.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.11">Holes in the Woods: Rich wasn&#x2019;t partial to physical labor, so Brogan did the digging.

All he has are garbage bags filled with clothes and keepsakes, a few pictures of his family, and a soiled ream of personal documents of the type you see the itinerant clutching outside government offices everywhere.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.13">Before they get into the car, Rich starts telling Tim which of his things he&#x2019;ll need down on the farm and what he should come back to pick up later. Take this, leave that. A toolbox, a believable amount of clothes, so Tim will think he&#x2019;s really going somewhere. Brogan, as the muscle, grapples the TV into his trunk. It&#x2019;s not even a flat-screen. Why does Rich want this TV? What kind of vetting process could Rich have done on this guy? Whatever slim margin of logic they&#x2019;ve been operating on, robbing and killing men who were themselves almost destitute, now it&#x2019;s out the window. Rich asks Tim how much cash he has on him to get by with down on the farm, and Tim gets all sheepish and says: Five bucks.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.14">While it&#x2019;s still dark, the three of them drive out of that parking lot and into the still-somnolent morning for what is supposed to be an hour-and-a-half drive to Caldwell. Rich and Brogan up front, with Tim in the back, like a kid.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.15">Rich keeps the patter up. He was always good like that. Brogan often remarked inwardly about how weird some of the stuff Rich talked to these men about was. Rich would always take them out for breakfast on the way to the farm, the big magnanimous boss guy. When they were eating breakfast with David Pauley just before they killed him, Rich told this long story about a friend of his who looked like Kenny Rogers, and when they&#x2019;d go out to eat, Rich would let it slip to the waiter that it really <em>was</em> Kenny Rogers and they&#x2019;d all eat for free. Today, Tim Kern seems affable in the face of Rich&#x2019;s small-talk fusillade, kind of dazy and trying to act professional around his new employer.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.16"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558306913655c24c6c956efd/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-06.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-06.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306913655c24c6c956efd%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-06.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306913655c24c6c956efd%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-06.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Courtesy of writer</div></figcaption></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.17">&quot;Chaplain Rich&quot; allegedly ran a prostitution ring out of the so-called halfway house <em>(above)</em>, he operated in Akron.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.18">What the Craigslist job offered Tim was an unforeseen opportunity: an actual grown-up life. Instant adulthood, including a place to live where his sons&#x2014;they were grown, but he called them his &quot;babies&quot;&#x2014;could come visit, a setup that lately seemed beyond him to puzzle out. Still, Tim did not exactly go gladly into this adventure. He&#x2019;d been anxious yesterday, wringing his hands, telling his boys he didn&#x2019;t want to leave them, staying up all night packing at Tina&#x2019;s house&#x2014;he still used it as kind of a home base for showering and the keeping of important items. He was trying to seem laid-back about it, but he felt pretty adrift, heading out that morning to go live by himself on a farm in southern Ohio.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.19">Before they get too far, Rich leans back and says, Hey man, turns out we were hunting for squirrels out by the old Rolling Acres Mall the other day. And you know what? I lost my watch. It&#x2019;s got a lot of sentimental value. Do you mind if we go over to the woods and look for it real quick before we head down to the farm? And Tim says, No, I don&#x2019;t mind.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1a">Granted, maybe Rich and Tim live in a world where it&#x2019;s not totally implausible to have been hunting squirrels in the Akron suburbs. But it was still a weird thing to say. This overly companionable aging biker type and his darkly silent &quot;nephew&quot; pick you up to drive you down to your new job on a farm, but first, at six in the morning, they want to root around the woods for a watch&#x2014;a watch!&#x2014;they lost shooting at urban rodents the other day? But what would you say if you were Tim? One thing about humans is that they will put up with all but the most absurd and alarming events once they&#x2019;ve signed on to a situation. There is in fact a moment when the teenage girl could jump out at the stoplight once she starts to get the smell of bad magic on the guy who said he&#x2019;d give her a lift home, when the homeowner could close the door on the man at the front steps whose face isn&#x2019;t composed right at all. But if you don&#x2019;t bail right away, chances are you will be along for the entire ride, however windy and gruesome and never-ending it turns out to be. We&#x2019;ve all done it: taken the cab even though the driver seems weird, gotten on the plane even though that guy in the trench coat is sweating and talking to himself, stayed in a situation even though some tingly instinct is telling you to flee. And what you&#x2019;ve learned from those experiences is that it always, always works out. Trust is how Craigslist works in the first place. The shocking thing isn&#x2019;t that the occasional bad actor on Craigslist shows up and takes advantage of that trust. The shocking thing about Craigslist is that it almost never happens.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1b">Tim Kern will not make it down to Caldwell today. He is not going to a desolate parcel of former strip-mining land carefully selected because it seemed like it might actually need a caretaker and because you can&#x2019;t hear a gunshot from the nearest house. Tim Kern will never get farther than the scrub woods around an abandoned suburban shopping mall. This criminal enterprise is rapidly devolving, the standards lowering from a kind of wannabe Hollywood film about professional hit men into a haphazard, tragically absurd killing spree. We know now that it will be over in a week. But to Brogan it seems like it could go on and on and on and on. When he talks about it now, he says he was living in a state of total acquiescence. A surrender to what he calls darkness. The entire period suffused with a thick matter that fundamentally transformed all things, from the food he ate to the people he talked to, into some kind of intolerable simulacra that tasted of metal and death.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1d">When I meet Brogan last fall at the Warren Correctional Institution, he&#x2019;s 18 years old and still looks older than he is. He wears his hair slicked back with product, comb marks visible, and a small trimmed mustache. He is fastidious, immaculate, his navy prison pajamas neat and creased. He does push-ups on his knuckles every morning, part of a fully regimented and scheduled day he once described in a letter: &quot;After returning from breakfast, I do my hygiene&#x2014;brush my teeth, etc. After that I try to straighten up the cell: make my bed, make coffee, fix the stuff on the floor&#x2026;&quot; Two years ago, he had never even been in the back of a police car. Now, in the early days of a life sentence with no possibility of parole, he has already come to inhabit the persona of the old professorial prisoner who approaches life inside with a quiet, philosophical asceticism.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1e">&quot;No one knows how old I am in here because I&#x2019;m old-school,&quot; he tells me. &quot;I carry myself as if I were older. I look like I&#x2019;m midtwenties. Plus, they all think I&#x2019;m this crazy killer. This serial killer. So they steer clear of me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1f">Brogan thanks me for coming, even though he gives the impression that he would rather be alone and is doing this because his father told him to. (Both Brogan and Rich are appealing their verdicts.) He refuses my offers of food and drink but eventually agrees to allow me to buy him a black coffee. He expresses disdain for the prisoners here who aren&#x2019;t like that: &quot;People in jail, they come around asking for coffee or food or whatnot,&quot; he says. &quot;No sense of shame, even if they don&#x2019;t know you at all. I would never do that. I would rather go without.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1g">We sit across a short table from each other over the course of two days. I knew he was going to be a quiet kid, but the way he&#x2019;s quiet is different. When I ask if he once loved Richard Beasley, the pause is so long, Brogan gazing kind of inwardly in the midst of the heartbreaking human calamity that is the visitors&#x2019; room&#x2014;shackled men with face ink and cornrows holding their newborn babies, old moms wheeling oxygen tanks to buy their only sons a microwavable calzone&#x2014;that I&#x2019;m not sure if I&#x2019;m waiting for an answer or this is his way of saying &quot;Pass.&quot; But it&#x2019;s not the desperate quietude of someone who wants to connect and can&#x2019;t figure out how. It&#x2019;s an almost imperturbable sense of independence. Brogan is, and always was, <em>a priori</em> different, is how he sees it. He&#x2019;s not like me, he&#x2019;s not like the kids in his high school class, he&#x2019;s not like the man shackled with the neck ink, he has never been like anyone ever except maybe his dad and his mom, though both of them were always at distances so permanently untraversable that he couldn&#x2019;t know for sure if he was like them or not. He has never really needed other people. (This is convenient, because he has never <em>had</em> anyone he could safely need.)</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583069009f0bee56440e5c7/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-07.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-07.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069009f0bee56440e5c7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-07.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069009f0bee56440e5c7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-07.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Karen Schiely/Akron Beacon Journal/AP Photo</div></figcaption></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1i">&quot;Chaplain Rich&quot; is shown here with Brogan in a restaurant surveillance video, getting a bite before an attempted murder.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1j">The first time I met Mike Rafferty, Brogan&#x2019;s dad, he was in his garage listening to Deep Purple, &quot;Smoke on the Water,&quot; lifting weights on a quiet afternoon in his three-bedroom suburban ranch. Early fifties, small in stature, I&#x2019;d guess five feet eight inches, built almost in a square, a Rubik&#x2019;s Cube of flesh, with a long dark ponytail, a prominent forehead, a small expressionless mouth, and shiny dark eyes framed out by the longest, most beautiful, dark eyelashes that give a poignancy to the latent violence he exudes. It&#x2019;s like My Little Pony was a 53-year-old biker from the rust belt of Akron. He is a machinist by trade, works nights precision-cutting metal for aircraft landing gear, and, yes, is the president and a member in good and legendary standing of the North Coast motorcycle club, a close affiliate of the Hells Angels. According to police, North Coast is suspected of dealing in meth, but Mike has no criminal record, save for a public-urination charge, and strikes me, while he sits on his sofa in jean shorts and a tank top, as a straight arrow who does not suffer fools gladly or without punching them in the face.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1k">&quot;Maybe I wasn&#x2019;t the kind of father I should have been,&quot; he says. &quot;I wasn&#x2019;t real good at showing emotion, and I was a bit of a disciplinarian.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1l">The kind of father he was: the kind who buys a small house in a good school district, teaches his kid to box in the garage starting when he&#x2019;s 5; who didn&#x2019;t drink on weeknights but spent Fridays at &quot;church&quot; (the weekly meeting of North Coast) and most of the weekend at bars; who, Brogan says, once broke the boy&#x2019;s nose over a missing report card; who Rich and Brogan and Yvette, Brogan&#x2019;s mother, all agree was a good provider but terrified Brogan. From Mike, Brogan learned what Mike saw as that most important tool: self-reliance. To be able to take care of yourself in a fight, to get yourself to school, to keep a straight house and get good grades, to understand never to make excuses or dwell on how hard it all is. Up until that November, Mike saw himself as a biker-machinist dad who was doing a pretty good job raising a boy more or less on his own. It was a stable place to live, but not a home that allowed for certain parts of being a kid: like admitting that you&#x2019;re weak, and you don&#x2019;t have the answers, and that circumstances can arise that you simply cannot be expected to take care of by yourself.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1m">Brogan&#x2019;s mother, on the other hand, is an addict. Over time, he&#x2019;d reduced his relationship with her to the smallest unit of parenting she could handle: Brogan told Yvette she could go on a crack binge&#x2014;because no matter what she promised, she was going to go on a crack binge anyway&#x2014;she just couldn&#x2019;t do it on the weekends Brogan was with her. But he couldn&#x2019;t rely on even that.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1n">I met Yvette for dinner this past winter. Yvette was a biker chick from the first time she ever got on the back of a motorcycle. &quot;I was hot as shit, I ain&#x2019;t gonna lie,&quot; she told me over steak at TGI Fridays. &quot;Hair down to my ass. I was hot.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1o">By all accounts this description of Yvette Rafferty is accurate. She arrived in northern Ohio from out of the American South as a woman from a dream issue of <em>Easyriders</em> magazine, skinny and willowy, with hair spun from ice cream and sunshine and a taste for denim and leather. She liked to party, and she was crazy, too. She once rode a big old dirt bike that belonged to a Mexican all the way back from Daytona Beach while the bike&#x2019;s owner leaned back and slept against the luggage rack. <em>And she ain&#x2019;t never even rode a dirt bike before!</em> She met Mike when she was working at a bikini bar. That was not long before she became addicted to cocaine. She says she was sober while she was pregnant. But Brogan wasn&#x2019;t 3 days old when she disappeared into a crack house with him still swaddled in a hospital blanket. Mike took Brogan away after that, and they separated. She still seems like kind of a love mama, even though a good chunk of her humanity appears to have disappeared into addiction. She is a hug person, a kiss person, a person who loves to cry, the type of hippie biker chick who&#x2019;d want to sleep with all her babies in a big family bed but also bungee them to a chopper for a ride to get formula. But in reality she is now a 49-year-old woman who has to remove her new dentures before she eats a TGI Fridays steak with Jack Daniel&#x2019;s sauce. Who, after two beers, starts shivering and loses the gift of coherent speech for long stretches and tries to eat a wet nap off her plate. Sits there chewing it like lettuce until I reach into her toothless mouth before she can swallow it. Brogan has known before memory that his mother is an addict. When he was 10, he found evidence on the Internet that she&#x2019;d prostituted herself. The really terrible moments of my dinner with her came when she admitted knowing what she&#x2019;d become. Her face crumpled and she said: &quot;I know all this is my fault. I know it is. If I hadn&#x2019;t have been an addict, none of this would have happened.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1p"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1q">&quot;To me, he was just death,&quot; Brogan tells me. &quot;When I thought of him, it was death.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1r">Rich was death incarnate?</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1s">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1t">Rich must have known, somehow, that Brogan could handle living through that darkness without imploding. It was Rich&#x2019;s gift to see potential where others do not, where most people would not want to <em>look</em> for potential. Rich was almost blinded by the opportunities he saw&#x2014;like growing weed or making moonshine or faking a raffle or trading on the inherent advantages of running a &quot;halfway house&quot; in the hood&#x2014;in a way that seemed to make normal opportunity almost invisible to him. What Mike, Brogan&#x2019;s dad, used to say about Rich was that he&#x2019;d rather make a crooked nickel than an honest dollar. It was the kind of thing you could say right to Rich&#x2019;s face and he&#x2019;d laugh about it. Mike says Rich once asked him if he&#x2019;d like to rob a bank. Which Mike most certainly didn&#x2019;t want to do. But those were the kinds of things kicking around in Rich&#x2019;s head.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1u">It&#x2019;s my theory that Rich saw in Brogan a kind of potential that Brogan was probably unaware of. Rich knew Mike from the world of Akron bikers, and Yvette from a life that brought him into the drug houses and jails of Akron, and he knew Brogan. This hulking castoff of a kid, who strangers thought was possibly mute but confidants knew as a preternaturally sardonic kid who acted like a full-grown man but was probably hiding a stunted little baby somewhere inside, like a worm larva in the middle of an apple. I&#x2019;m not saying that Rich became friends with Brogan when he was 9 as part of a long con. Rich probably started taking Brogan to church because it felt like a good Christian thing to do. Rich seemed to genuinely enjoy hanging out with Brogan, tooling around Akron, visiting historic graveyards and dropping general world knowledge. And in the bargain Brogan, according to the amateur psychology of pretty much everyone who came into contact with them, got a dad who wasn&#x2019;t a hard-ass, who took him around and treated him like an equal, but who also understood (without judgment) the world where his mom came from, a secret he didn&#x2019;t much share with his friends from school. Yvette describes Brogan&#x2019;s feelings this way: &quot;Brogan was ashamed of me, but he loved me.&quot; Rich was kind of like Brogan himself&#x2014;they both straddled the straight world and the world of the street. And when the time came, Rich knew what Brogan&#x2019;s skill set might be, knew how to activate it, and he apparently didn&#x2019;t hesitate.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1v"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558306903655c24c6c956ef7/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-09.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-09.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-09.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-09.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306903655c24c6c956ef7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-09.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-09.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306903655c24c6c956ef7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-09.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-09.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1w">In the summer of 2011, before they lured that first man, Ralph Geiger, down to southern Ohio, Rich had a conversation with Brogan. There was going to be a warrant out for Rich&#x2019;s arrest. And if they got him, he said, they were going to put him away for a crime he didn&#x2019;t commit. So he was going to go on the run. This news lit in Brogan an incandescent bloom of indignation that in the mind of a 16-year-old can glow so much more purely than in people like you or me. <em>The damn cops,</em> he knew about them, they messed with his mother.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1x">&quot;Well, he had told me this story about how they were going to put him in jail over some old stuff that he didn&#x2019;t do,&quot; Brogan says. &quot;I was angry. I was angry. It didn&#x2019;t seem right.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1y">But then, when the murders began, it couldn&#x2019;t have been just about that anger anymore. Whatever compelled Brogan to help Rich, it had to have become something else. Brogan says now that he did what Rich said because Rich threatened him. He told Brogan: <em>I know where your mother lives</em>. <em>I know where your sister lives</em>. He would check on Brogan every day, call him, have him meet up. Brogan says that every time he dug a hole, he expected that he might end up in it. This explanation seems too simple to me, but Brogan&#x2019;s is the only narrative we have about these events.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.1z">Threatened or not, Brogan trudged on. Like a golem. Made of clay by his master, animate but not awake to his humanity. To be there and not really be there, the way he is when we are at the Warren Correctional Institution, that was what Brogan could do better than just about anyone. I would say that Brogan&#x2019;s greatest skill as accomplice in a crime of massively gruesome proportions is to be able to locate himself fathoms beneath the emotional sea even when he&#x2019;s right beside you.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.20">Does Rich see himself as a man attuned to the potential lurking in places other men would never look? I try to broach the topic when I meet him on death row. I ask about the warrant that had been out for his arrest, which was for, essentially, running a prostitution ring&#x2014;twenty women, one male&#x2014;out of his &quot;halfway&quot; house. A prostitution ring staffed by the women he ministered to. The women for whom he&#x2019;d stood up in court to promise judges that, as counselor and halfway-house proprietor, he&#x2019;d look after them. The women he&#x2019;d visit in jail, talk on jailhouse phones with, and describe his physical longing for in conversations the authorities were recording. By most accounts, his favorite had been a 17-year-old girl named Savannah, who died of an overdose. Brogan knew her as Rich&#x2019;s girlfriend.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.21">I tell Rich that I interviewed one of these women, Amy Saller. She told me, I say, that you did try to get her off drugs, in a way. She said you had devised your own detox system: three rocks one day, and then two for each of the next couple of days, and then down to one. But it never worked. So you&#x2019;d just buy her the rocks and let her smoke them at your place. She thought your biggest fear was that she would leave, and you wanted her near you. Sure, you wanted to trick with her sometimes, but she seemed to feel she had you in her back pocket. She knew she could steal from you and you might yell and scream, but you weren&#x2019;t going to get violent. She said you put her up as an escort on Backpage and took a commission on the money she made. It was strange that Amy, whom you pimped out, who has in the intervening months gotten sober and is working at Red Lobster now and has earned the right to visit her kid, talks as if she isn&#x2019;t totally sure who was using whom. When I ask you about all of the above, your answer is only: &quot;Amy Saller. I&#x2019;m sorry, I don&#x2019;t know who that is.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.22">And about the notion of those physical longings and the like: &quot;I haven&#x2019;t been able to have sex since I had my car accident,&quot; Rich tells me. He&#x2019;s referring to an accident he had about eight years ago. &quot;I had a steel coffee cup in my lap when it happened.&quot; He smiles mischievously here and slits his eyes like a cat. &quot;You can&#x2019;t use what you don&#x2019;t have.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.23">And then, thinking about it, he gets a little more grandiose. &quot;I think it was a blessing from God that I wasn&#x2019;t able to have sex. If I could, it might have complicated the relationship I had with all those women. I might have been tempted. But as it was, I was able to remain pure.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.24"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.25">On the way to the Rolling Acres Mall, Tim mentions that he likes Brogan&#x2019;s Buick. Rich has a plan for Tim&#x2019;s car: He and Brogan will come back with some blowtorches and scrap the car themselves for cash. Rich will take the cash and give Tim a Ford F-150. A more appropriate vehicle for the terrain down on the farm. Tim will pay off the difference in installments that will come out of his wages. It&#x2019;s almost as if Rich enjoys spinning out these scenarios, a natural outgrowth of the fecundity of his scheming brain&#x2014;he&#x2019;s got the gift, so why not just share it with the world?</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.26">Rolling Acres is Chernobyl-y, with its cheerful awnings inviting you to condemned movie theaters and the now removed names of big-box stores silhouetted onto the brickwork of its entrances. The mall was built in the &#x2019;70s and expanded in the &#x2019;80s, and now, in the aftermath of the Great Recession, is home to only a single JCPenney outlet store that will itself soon be shuttered. They pull around an outbuilding and park near the woods.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.27">When they brought men to &quot;the farm,&quot; Rich had a trick he&#x2019;d pull. He&#x2019;d walk in front of the subjects right away and let them follow him down one of the tracks into the forest. Having a stranger walking behind you into the woods tends to raise defenses. And then at some point&#x2014;like in Scott Davis&#x2019;s case, when they were looking for some construction equipment they couldn&#x2019;t find&#x2014;there&#x2019;d be an excuse to turn around. And just like that, the subject would be out in front. That&#x2019;s when Rich would shoot him in the head without the victim ever knowing what happened, Brogan says. It was the beauty of Rich&#x2019;s method that he never had to lay a hand on anyone, never had to overpower a body&#x2014;he simply had to pick the right people and then be the guy in charge.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.28">And now they are in the woods, looking for this &quot;watch.&quot; Rich pulls back a branch and lets it slap back at Brogan and Tim. Then Tim holds it back for Brogan so he can walk by. This act of kindness disturbs Brogan, though he doesn&#x2019;t say anything.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.29">Rich and Tim walk together, looking. Brogan acts like he&#x2019;s searching the thick November leaf layer a few yards away. Brogan says he hears a <em>pop.</em> When he turns, he sees that Tim is down on his knees and Rich has the .22 in his hand. Tim&#x2019;s holding the side of his head. And then Rich says, &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Like he&#x2019;s concerned Tim&#x2019;s hurt himself. But when Tim doesn&#x2019;t respond, Rich shoots him again, and again, and again, and Tim slumps over onto his side. There&#x2019;s something wrong with the gun, Rich is saying. And it hits Brogan then that Tim is still breathing. All of these events, Brogan says, they blend together&#x2014;maybe because he has a powerful reluctance to go back over them or because he dissociates even right there in the moment. But this whole debacle is beyond the pale, horrific in an absurd, intolerable way to Brogan. This man has nothing worth stealing, there is no reason to kill him. And now he won&#x2019;t die. Rich gets up close and shoots him a last time, in the face. Now Tim is lying on the ground, eyes open wide and staring at the leafless branches above. Every few seconds he takes a big, audible gulp of air, like a dying fish. He&#x2019;s still alive, Brogan says, he&#x2019;s still alive. Rich says no. No way. His brain is dead, there are four bullets in his head and I put one between his eyes.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2a">It stops eventually, the desperate, drowning sounds. Then Rich says to grab a leg and takes the other one himself. And together they drag Tim to the hole. It&#x2019;s only two feet deep, and Tim doesn&#x2019;t completely fit in there. But Rich doesn&#x2019;t seem to care. He removes Tim&#x2019;s jacket and cuts the shirt off with a pair of scissors. That black hat he kicks to the side&#x2014;it&#x2019;s covered in blood.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2b">Why? Brogan says he asks Rich. Why did we do this, he didn&#x2019;t have anything. Rich has his own logic about it: Well, he was a dead man as soon as he got in the car. As if it had been out of their hands.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2c"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558306903655c24c6c956ef2/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-12.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-12.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-12.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-12.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306903655c24c6c956ef2%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-12.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-12.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306903655c24c6c956ef2%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-12.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-12.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Karen Schiely/Akron Beacon Journal/AP Photo</div></figcaption></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2d">Richard Beasley.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2e">The first time, with Ralph Geiger, they removed all the clothes, covered him with lime, replaced the ground cover so you could have walked right over the grave and you wouldn&#x2019;t have suspected anything. For David Pauley, they had changes of boots, gloves; Rich had even put a $20 bill next to the hole so they&#x2019;d know if anyone saw the hole in the interim. But by the time they got to Tim&#x2026; Well, Tim is still in his pants and shoes and socks. Brogan isn&#x2019;t even finished backfilling the hole when Rich tells him to stop. It&#x2019;s getting light out now. Rich is ready to get out of here. He starts kicking some leaves over the hole.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2f">This would be the last murder. Scott Davis had gotten away. And he talked to the police. Right now, as Brogan and Rich are at the mall, the FBI is tracing the Craigslist ad back to Rich&#x2019;s IP address, and later to a camera at a Shoney&#x2019;s in Marietta, Ohio, that snapped a picture of Brogan and Rich as they walked in to meet Scott Davis the morning he was shot. Three days from now, agents will show up at Stow high school and pull Brogan from class. He will still have the TV in his trunk. He and Rich won&#x2019;t even have scrapped Tim&#x2019;s car yet&#x2014;there will have been functionally zero financial or other gain from the murder of Tim Kern. The same day Brogan is arrested, a SWAT team will pick up Rich outside the house where he rented the room. There will be a helicopter and everything.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2g">It&#x2019;s getting lighter out as they drive back from Rolling Acres. Rich has Brogan stop at McDonald&#x2019;s for breakfast. Rich likes McDonald&#x2019;s because of the free Internet. Brogan says they don&#x2019;t speak. Rich taps on his computer, and Brogan watches the street outside as the day gets brighter. He drops Rich at his place and heads for his mom&#x2019;s. When he&#x2019;s pulling up the hill toward home, he gets a call from Yvette on his cell. She&#x2019;s crying. A man she knows&#x2014;the guy she calls her &quot;millionaire maniac,&quot; a &quot;famous&quot; dog breeder, known for his prize German shepherds, who likes to party&#x2014;had been an asshole last night, and now she is walking home. Brogan doesn&#x2019;t say much, just that he&#x2019;ll pick her up on the way home. She&#x2019;s still crying when she gets into the passenger seat. This is one of those periodic moments of clarity for her, when she can see plainly what the dynamic is with her son, Brogan being the stable one, the guy who comes to the rescue. I&#x2019;m sorry I wasn&#x2019;t there last night, she says, I didn&#x2019;t know you were coming over this weekend, I swear. Brogan stops her. It doesn&#x2019;t matter, Mom. It really doesn&#x2019;t matter.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2h"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2i">A few months before I go to Chillicothe to meet Rich, I have breakfast with Carol Beasley, Rich&#x2019;s mom, at a bakery near her house. She is a kind woman in a cute Christmas sweater who is befuddled by her own cell phone and is more worried about the weather for my flight back to New York than I am. Carol tells me that she doesn&#x2019;t want to fool herself. Richard probably did the things they say he did. Though she can&#x2019;t help slipping into the framework Rich has provided her for these events&#x2014;the inconsistencies, the suggestion of plots underlying the apparent facts. &quot;But why did Scott Davis make the ambulance take him to Akron General hospital, which is right by the motorcycle club?&quot; she asks me. &quot;He literally had to pass several other hospitals on his way there. And why did Scott refuse to talk to the police for days?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2j">We have a philosophical conversation about how, even if she pretty much knows the truth, she won&#x2019;t really be able to process it until Rich admits it. I tell her that I&#x2019;ve exchanged some letters with him in advance of our meeting. I told him I was hoping that he would be able to fully open up, to come clean. No one will really know what happened until he does. My guess is that it won&#x2019;t change the facts. But it seems impossible to understand this whole saga without knowing the truth from Rich&#x2014;why he decided to do this, what he thought as he slept in the same hotel room with Ralph Geiger the night before he murdered him.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2k"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583069009f0bee56440e5c1/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-13.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-13.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-13.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-13.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069009f0bee56440e5c1%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-13.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-13.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcraigslist-killers&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069009f0bee56440e5c1%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-13.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-07-craigslist-killer-craigslist-killers-gq-magazine-july-2014-13.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Phil Masturzo/Akron Beacon Journal/AP Photo</div></figcaption></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2l">Surviving Prison: &quot;I carry myself as if I were older,&quot; says Brogan, pictured here in court with his mom, Yvette.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2m">It&#x2019;s also true that there are things we don&#x2019;t know about Brogan. He claims he participated in these crimes because Rich overtly threatened him. I think it&#x2019;s also possible that Brogan participated because he thought he needed to <em>be a man</em>. But even if Brogan is lying about the threats, even if he believes that he did this of his own free will, I think it was still, functionally, coercion. These murder-robberies benefited only one person: Richard Beasley. There was some discussion at the trial about how Brogan received treasure from these men: David Pauley&#x2019;s shotgun, etc. But that fact strikes me more like, for instance, an uncle who has molested his nephew and then buys him anything he wants at the toy store, and in so doing binds all kinds of incompatible emotions (shame, guilt, pleasure, terror, pain) into a terrible cocktail that can never be unmid. Regardless, I tell Carol that morning that I hope Rich can tell the whole truth, because it&#x2019;s the only possible way to take even a fractional step toward making amends.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2n">&quot;Oh,&quot; Carol Beasley says, the shiny tinsel threads in her sweater throwing plasticky sparks beneath the recessed lighting, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think so. He doesn&#x2019;t want anyone to know the real him. He never has. He&#x2019;s too ashamed. He will never, ever do that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2o">And she was right. The moment he sat down across the table from me, with that twinkle in his eye, Rich began telling magnificent stories. Ralph Geiger had been down in Caldwell, &quot;pounding nails&quot; for work, when he came across a meth lab he shouldn&#x2019;t have seen, and the meth dealers had to walk him out into the woods and kill him. Brogan murdered Tim Kern himself, with an accomplice, as a way to earn his colors in the North Coast motorcycle club. Rich seemed to understand that some of this was hard to believe, and so he didn&#x2019;t gild the lily. When we came to a fact that didn&#x2019;t make sense, he made like the two of us were trying to piece this whole mystery together, but he could only help me so much. &quot;I don&#x2019;t know,&quot; he&#x2019;d say, staring off at a section of floor fifteen feet away, as if examining some mysterious half-human creature who&#x2019;d been following him at this distance for quite some time. &quot;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m trying to figure out. I don&#x2019;t know.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2p">But he did not confess to a thing. Near the end of our conversations, I ask him a little bit about religion. Because it would seem that this failure to come clean would probably have some ramifications with God, if Rich happened to believe in God.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2q"><em>How is it a fellow gets to heaven?</em></p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2r">&quot;I believe you will go to heaven if you accept Jesus Christ into your heart as your savior.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2s"><em>You don&#x2019;t have to confess to anyone?</em></p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2t">&quot;You have to confess to God and ask forgiveness.

And if I could communicate with men outside these walls, he said, it would make me feel free, too.</p><p data-reactid=".28b3f6abhmo.1.1.0.0.4.2x"><a href="../contributors/devin-friedman"><strong>Devin
