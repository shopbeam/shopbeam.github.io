There sure are a lot of people in here. \u000A\u000AI used to be at the MIT Media Lab, which is sort of legendary for being the coolest, mid-disciplinary space. I thought I\u0027d never work with as many smart people ever again, but on this floor it\u0027s even better. It\u0027s really collaborative, and everyone\u0027s so high-level here. There are like four TED fellows and five Ph.D.\u0027s. There\u0027s a DIY bio-lab in the back; they teach open classes to anyone who wants to come. So it\u0027s academic, but it\u0027s not stuffy academic. It\u0027s more like everyone\u0027s in love with the work.\u000A\u000ADid you start your artistic practice at MIT?\u000A\u000AI can\u0027t render; I just don\u0027t have that sort of a brain. So, for a long time I felt like an artist without a medium. But when I started studying human computer interaction and learning how to write software, do electronics, and make interactive things with sensors, I realized this was a material to make art with. I found my medium.\u000A\u000ADON\u0027T MISS THIS\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000AEven your more research-based projects are incredibly playful. Is that a resource for your art? \u000A\u000AI kind of like Baldessari\u0027s statement, you should never make boring art. I think the first impression should always be beautiful and engaging just on its own aesthetics. But my art really comes more from a questioning of the world. I look at things and I don\u0027t understand them, so I work on them through an art practice as a process of understanding.\u000A\u000ASo you consider your work an exploration of materials. \u000A\u000AMaterials and concepts and practices: A lot of my work in the last few years has been about visual representation in digital culture. We\u0027re surrounded by screens. They mediate so much of human experience now, but they\u0027re constructed from these abstract, non-spatial parts that we have no feel for—no visceral connection to. I\u0027m trying to understand what it means to have this material convey so much of our life experience.\u000A\u000AWhere do you draw the line between the technological and the artistic?\u000A\u000ATechnology has its own logic. It\u0027s often about taking insights from the sciences and operationalizing them into something that can become an engineering process, which is fun and beautiful and requires its own artistry. But Art—with a capital A—in the tradition of the art world and the tradition of human understanding has been more about questioning, trying to understand culture, making statements, and personal exploration. That\u0027s not really technological.There\u0027s a difference.\u000A\u000AJust like you might use paint to create a rendering of an image that is an artwork, you can use a circuit to make a representation of a concept.\u000A\u000AWhat does beauty mean to you? \u000A\u000AI mean you can find beauty anywhere. To me it\u0027s an experience of pleasure in observing something, or understanding something. Beauty can be found in understanding a math equation. But beauty can also be my brother\u0027s farm in Vermont. I think it\u0027s a really abstract concept, actually.\u000A\u000ACan you take us through that process of realizing beauty in your own work? \u000A\u000AThe \u0027Triangular Series\u0027 actually started as a concept my former collaborator Marcelo Coelho and I had five years ago. We were thinking about this process called entrainment.\u000A\u000ASo, entrainment was first discovered in the 17th century by this Dutch physicist, Christiaan Huygens. He invented the pendulum clock; he realized that when he put multiple pendulum clocks on the wall, they would eventually synch—no matter when they were started. He called it an odd sympathy. Later the sciences discovered this same process. It\u0027s a feedback system within the world. One pendulum pushes on the wall, which pushes against another one, and eventually they find a common locum. The cardiac myocytes in your heart that control contraction use the same system—the same physics—but it\u0027s through chemistry. Our voice, the rhythms of our voice, will entrain. So it\u0027s this fundamental property of synchrony between oscillating systems.\u000A\u000AWhat I found beautiful about that was that here\u0027s this invisible connective force that connects us without us even realizing it.\u000A\u000ASo we tried to realize this idea in a few ways, and none of them worked out. I kind of let it sit for a while—Marcel and I stopped working together. And then T Magazine wanted to do a piece on me, and they wanted to know if I had anything new to make. So I just decided I was finally going to figure out this entrainment thing, but do it right. We built the prototype in something like two weeks.\u000A\u000AIs a collaborative environment important to you? \u000A\u000AYeah, at the time I had three employees. We all made it together. For this prototype we needed to do it so fast that we ended up building an 8-foot router table in the basement, cutting all this acrylic ourselves, making jigs, setting up the glue process, and figuring out the suspension. We all figured it out together.\u000A\u000AWhy is collaboration so important? \u000A\u000ABecause I like to take on big challenging ideas, and to try and do it all myself would be stupid.\u000A\u000ADo you have any advice on how someone should look at a piece of yours? \u000A\u000AMy feeling on this is that you should always just try to put your preconceptions aside. Don\u0027t worry about what to expect or what it\u0027s supposed to be.\u000A\u000ADo you see your work as having a sort of instrumentality? \u000A\u000AI think so. I think some people would say that art isn\u0027t supposed to be instrumental or functional. But you can corrupt that semantics a little bit and think about understanding or experience as an instrument.\u000A\u000ADo you think the art and technological worlds are moving closer together, or should move closer together? \u000A\u000AThat\u0027s a really interesting question because if you look at the history of art, before about 1950, the sciences had always been an important part of art. Picasso was reading Bohr. The quantum physicists in the \u002720s were getting drunk with the abstract expressionists. This was all happening at the same time. They were feeding off each other.\u000A\u000AThis is my own na&amp;#xEF;ve theory, but some time around Warhol, the industrialization of art practice, and Pop Art I think something changed to a certain extent. Post modernism started to think of art as this thing that\u0027s separate from the material world. At the same time computers were just starting, and it was really hard see them within an artistic context. So there\u0027s this kind of bubble where all of the sudden art is different from science in a very substantial way.\u000A\u000AI feel like, really, it\u0027s always been the same, though; they are parallel narratives.\u000A\u000AWhat were you trying to achieve with your installation at Basel? \u000A\u000AIt was completely about constructing a dialogue between very different things: a constructed, synthetic light form and a human being. If somebody were to walk into the piece and feel some sense of communication, some connection with it at all: that\u0027s success.\u000A\u000AWhat do you think Art Basel is doing for artists? Is it providing a space for that connection? \u000A\u000AI think Art Basel does a great job of collecting a huge number of new and relevant artists and presenting them to the public. There is this kind of nefarious commoditization and investment that happens in the art world, but that\u0027s not the only thing happening. There\u0027s also really interesting work you might not otherwise see.\u000A\u000ADoes the commerciality bother you? \u000A\u000AI make art because I want to. It\u0027s not just about me though; I want people to engage with it. That\u0027s one of the great things that Art Basel does: it allows people to experience the work. I\u0027m doing this so people see it. It\u0027s not just like I do this for myself. No. It\u0027s a communication with the world, with culture. Commerce is one avenue to that; the academic world is another; museums are another. It\u0027s all a way of connecting.",

Is that a resource for your art? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.j">I kind of like Baldessari&#x2019;s statement, you should never make boring art. I think the first impression should always be beautiful and engaging just on its own aesthetics. But my art really comes more from a questioning of the world. I look at things and I don&#x2019;t understand them, so I work on them through an art practice as a process of understanding.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>So you consider your work an exploration of materials. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.l">Materials and concepts and practices: A lot of my work in the last few years has been about visual representation in digital culture. We&#x2019;re surrounded by screens. They mediate so much of human experience now, but they&#x2019;re constructed from these abstract, non-spatial parts that we have no feel for&#x2014;no visceral connection to. I&#x2019;m trying to understand what it means to have this material convey so much of our life experience.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Where do you draw the line between the technological and the artistic?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.n">Technology has its own logic. It&#x2019;s often about taking insights from the sciences and operationalizing them into something that can become an engineering process, which is fun and beautiful and requires its own artistry. But Art&#x2014;with a capital A&#x2014;in the tradition of the art world and the tradition of human understanding has been more about questioning, trying to understand culture, making statements, and personal exploration. That&#x2019;s not really technological.There&#x2019;s a difference.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.o">Just like you might use paint to create a rendering of an image that is an artwork, you can use a circuit to make a representation of a concept.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>What does beauty mean to you? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.q">I mean you can find beauty anywhere. To me it&#x2019;s an experience of pleasure in observing something, or understanding something. Beauty can be found in understanding a math equation. But beauty can also be my brother&#x2019;s farm in Vermont. I think it&#x2019;s a really abstract concept, actually.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>Can you take us through that process of realizing beauty in your own work? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.s">The &#x2019;Triangular Series&#x2019; actually started as a concept my former collaborator Marcelo Coelho and I had five years ago. We were thinking about this process called entrainment.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.t">So, entrainment was first discovered in the 17th century by this Dutch physicist, Christiaan Huygens. He invented the pendulum clock; he realized that when he put multiple pendulum clocks on the wall, they would eventually synch&#x2014;no matter when they were started. He called it an odd sympathy. Later the sciences discovered this same process. It&#x2019;s a feedback system within the world. One pendulum pushes on the wall, which pushes against another one, and eventually they find a common locum. The <em>cardiac myocytes</em> in your heart that control contraction use the same system&#x2014;the same physics&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s through chemistry. Our voice, the rhythms of our voice, will entrain. So it&#x2019;s this fundamental property of synchrony between oscillating systems.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.u">What I found beautiful about that was that here&#x2019;s this invisible connective force that connects us without us even realizing it.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.v">So we tried to realize this idea in a few ways, and none of them worked out. I kind of let it sit for a while&#x2014;Marcel and I stopped working together. And then <em>T Magazine</em> wanted to do a piece on me, and they wanted to know if I had anything new to make. So I just decided I was finally going to figure out this entrainment thing, but do it right. We built the prototype in something like two weeks.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong>Is a collaborative environment important to you? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.x">Yeah, at the time I had three employees. We all made it together. For this prototype we needed to do it so fast that we ended up building an 8-foot router table in the basement, cutting all this acrylic ourselves, making jigs, setting up the glue process, and figuring out the suspension. We all figured it out together.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.y"><strong>Why is collaboration so important? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.z">Because I like to take on big challenging ideas, and to try and do it all myself would be stupid.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong>Do you have any advice on how someone should look at a piece of yours? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.11">My feeling on this is that you should always just try to put your preconceptions aside. Don&#x2019;t worry about what to expect or what it&#x2019;s supposed to be.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.12"><strong>Do you see your work as having a sort of instrumentality? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.13">I think so. I think some people would say that art <em>isn&#x2019;t </em>supposed to be instrumental or functional. But you can corrupt that semantics a little bit and think about understanding or experience as an instrument.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.14"><strong>Do you think the art and technological worlds are moving closer together, or <em>should</em> move closer together? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.15">That&#x2019;s a really interesting question because if you look at the history of art, before about 1950, the sciences had always been an important part of art. Picasso was reading Bohr. The quantum physicists in the &#x2019;20s were getting drunk with the abstract expressionists. This was all happening at the same time. They were feeding off each other.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.16">This is my own na&amp;#xEF;ve theory, but some time around Warhol, the industrialization of art practice, and Pop Art I think something changed to a certain extent. Post modernism started to think of art as this thing that&#x2019;s separate from the material world. At the same time computers were just starting, and it was really hard see them within an artistic context. So there&#x2019;s this kind of bubble where all of the sudden art is <em>different </em>from science in a very substantial way.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.17">I feel like, really, it&#x2019;s always been the same, though; they are parallel narratives.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.18"><strong>What were you trying to achieve with your installation at Basel? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.19">It was completely about constructing a dialogue between very different things: a constructed, synthetic light form and a human being. If somebody were to walk into the piece and feel some sense of communication, some connection with it at all: that&#x2019;s success.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.1a"><strong>What do you think Art Basel is doing for artists? Is it providing a space for that connection? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.1b">I think Art Basel does a great job of collecting a huge number of new and relevant artists and presenting them to the public. There is this kind of nefarious commoditization and investment that happens in the art world, but that&#x2019;s not the only thing happening. There&#x2019;s also really interesting work you might not otherwise see.</p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><strong>Does the commerciality bother you? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.4.1d">I make art because I want to. It&#x2019;s not just about me though; I want people to engage with it. That&#x2019;s one of the great things that Art Basel does: it allows people to experience the work. I&#x2019;m doing this so people see it. It&#x2019;s not just like I do this for myself. No. It&#x2019;s a communication with the world, with culture. Commerce is one avenue to that; the academic world is another; museums are another. It&#x2019;s all a way of connecting.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1xv3o0434zk.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
