Bono and U2\u000A\u000AThe Tom Friedman of rock and the rest of his band collaborated with Apple to strong-arm their new album into your iTunes library without your consent. You couldn\u0027t even delete it! Apple had to send out specific instructions for how to wipe Songs of Innocence (God, that title) off your computer. The worst part was the way both Apple and U2 treated this, like it was some kind of noble gift to The People; in fact this was a $100 million marketing campaign. Yes, $100 million to turn U2\u0027s socially conscious dad-rock into a piece of direct mail.\u000A\u000A 2. Barack Obama\u000A\u000AWhy are you still on Martha\u0027s Vineyard?! Missouri is BURNING. Putin is conquering Europe. The CDC is playing nude Twister with Ebola patients. U2 is forcing bad songs on everyone. The NSA won\u0027t stop watching me masturbate. I need you ON THIS. Are you even president anymore? When Obama got blasted for golfing shortly after ISIS beheaded journalist James Foley, he said, \u0022I should\u0027ve anticipated the optics.\u0022 How do you win the presidency without knowing that golfing makes you look rich and indifferent?\u000A\u000A 3. Donald Sterling\u000A\u000AThe racist/slumlord/pervert/nudist ex-NBA owner displayed a remarkable lack of power in 2014. He failed to keep his girlfriend from recording him saying a bunch of horrible shit about black people. He failed to keep the NBA from taking over his Los Angeles Clippers. He failed to keep his wife from selling the Clippers to that bald guy from Microsoft. He failed at every attempt to sue his way back into ownership. He failed to win even a shred of our sympathy in a hilariously misguided interview with Anderson Cooper. And the best part is that it all caught him completely off guard. You mean I\u0027m not allowed to be a rich bastard who gets away with everything anymore? That\u0027s not fair!\u000A\u000A 4. Carter Bays and Craig Thomas\u000A\u000AThese were the men in charge of the How I Met Your Mother finale. SPOILER ALERT: In a surprise twist, the mom turns out to be dead. Dead! You labored through all those years of Neil Patrick Harris screaming out jokes about his dick, just to meet a corpse. It\u0027s a sitcom. Why does it even NEED a twist? It\u0027s not as if Cheers ended with all the characters turning out to be ghosts.\u000A\u000A 5. Zach Braff\u000A\u000ACan we all agree never to crowd-fund a movie again? Please? Who are these people who gave Zach Braff $3 million to make a Garden State do-over? Who has that kind of money to burn? Even though Braff is rich, he took the money, and just as he promised he would, he made yet another mope-piece that ached to be taken seriously as art. He should\u0027ve just filmed himself rubbing that money on his armpits.\u000A\u000A 6. Roger Goodell\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s made liking football feel gross and wrong. He should be fired for that.\u000A\u000A 7. Stephen A. Smith\u000A\u000AHe went on ESPN and ranted about how Ray Rice\u0027s fiance may have egged him into knocking her out (\u0022Let\u0027s make sure we don\u0027t do anything to provoke wrong actions\u0022), then tried to explain himself on Twitter and said something even dumber (\u0022What about addressing women on how they can help prevent the obvious wrong being done upon them?\u0022). Did he get fired for it? Of course not! How can ESPN fire SAS for being an idiot when they hired him specifically to be an idiot?\u000A\u000A 8. Dwyane Wade\u000A\u000ALeBron can talk all he wants about righting past wrongs, coming home, etc.... We all know the real reason he left Miami is because the once great Wade can\u0027t guard a column of marching ants at this point. His knees are the only things in America right now that are rusting faster than Cleveland.\u000A\u000A 9. CNN\u000A\u000AThey\u0027re still looking for that fucking plane! Is it in the ocean? Did it travel to another dimension? WAS IT A ZOMBIE PLANE?! We need to put the folks at CNN out of their misery. I can get better news standing at a goddamn bus stop.\u000A\u000A 10. Eric Cantor\u000A\u000A\u0022Campaign in my local primary? But I\u0027m already in Congress! People love Congress! I think I\u0027ve done enough to earn the loyalty of the great people of Virgini... OOPS!\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A 11. Derek Jeter\u000A\u000A4 HR, 50 RBI, .256 BA, 87 strikeouts, 11 errors.\u000A\u000A 12. Jay Nixon\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s the governor of Missouri. Did you know that? Pretty sure the people of Ferguson don\u0027t. They think their governor is a very large tank.\u000A\u000A 13. Rick Perry\u000A\u000AIs he really gonna run for president again? Hasn\u0027t he heard himself talk? Doesn\u0027t he know he\u0027s under indictment? He should be able to see all that with his new \u0022smart feller\u0022 glasses.\u000A\u000A 14. Benny Johnson\u000A\u000AThink about how hard it is to plagiarize when you\u0027re a writer for BuzzFeed. How do you plagiarize shit for a post called \u002210 Ways America Is Still Number One\u0022? Is it really so hard to think of reasons why we\u0027re number one? Food trucks. There ya go.\u000A\u000A 15. The Brazilian soccer team\u000A\u000ASeven to one! Holy shit, that is a churrascaria of ass-kicking. How do you lose that badly when you\u0027ve got a player named Hulk? HE\u0027S THE HULK! I guess they\u0027ve got the Eric Bana Hulk and not the Mark Ruffalo Hulk. And this is a country that requires winning soccer games in order for their crops to photosynthesize.\u000A\u000A 16. Johnny Depp\u000A\u000AHere\u0027s a crazy idea: What if Johnny Depp played an actual human beingone who could plausibly exist in real life? Not a dude living inside the Singularity. Not a rock-star pirate. Not a surrealist take on Hunter S. Thompson. An actual person. Can he even do that? Or is Johnny Depp just some kind of advanced mascaradroid prototype?\u000A\u000A 17. Cliven Bundy\u000A\u000AListen to the infamous Nevada cattle rancher on the subject of race: \u0022I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro.... There is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the porch.... And because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton.\u0022 It\u0027s funny that Bundy can say this while failing to mention that he would like free use of federal lands, in perpetuity, for his cattle to graze. The only difference between him and a welfare queen is that Bundy could point a gun at a federal officer and get away with it.\u000A\u000A 18. Suey Park\u000A\u000A\u0022Twitter activist\u0022 (we can probably stop right there) who began a \u0022movement\u0022 to cancel Stephen Colbert\u0027s talk show (#CancelColbert) because Colbert made a joke about Asian stereotypes that was actually a joke about Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder. Two weeks later, Colbert was chosen to replace Dave Letterman. I want to be the target of Twitter activism. Maybe I\u0027ll wind up in bed with Pippa Middleton.\u000A\u000A 19. Tom Wheeler\u000A\u000AThe FCC chairman is actively facilitating the demise of net neutrality by permitting a \u0022fast lane\u0022 for web access. Note that this plan sorta glosses over the \u0022slow lane\u0022 part. It will also enable ISPs to charge more for (probably) worse service. Did I mention that Wheeler is a former lobbyist for cable companies? WHAT A SURPRISE.\u000A\u000A 20. Chris Christie\u000A\u000AWould it shock you to learn that the investigation Chris Christie commissioned into investigating Chris Christie (for Bridgegate) ended up exonerating Chris Christie? Maybe Tom Wheeler was in charge of it.\u000A\u000AUPDATE: Since the print publication of this list, Christie, in his capacity as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, helped decisively turn the midterm elections in the Republicans\u0027 favor, which makes him a bit more influential than we initially gave him credit for, post-Bridgegate. So when your state governments do absolutely nothing for you for the next four years, be sure to thank him! \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A 21. Shia LaBeouf\u000A\u000AI know it\u0027s weird to put him on this list, given that he wrote King Lear, directed The Godfather, and was briefly the U.S. poet laureate. But I\u0027m telling you, there\u0027s something off about this LaBeouf fellalike he isn\u0027t everything he claims to be.... By the way, enough with celebrities excusing their asinine behaviorlike, say, wearing paper bags over their headsby claiming they were conducting some kind of sociological experiment about HUMANITY.\u000A\u000A 22. John McCain\u000A\u000ANo matter what foreign-policy stance the president takes, you can be certain that ol\u0027 Johnny Boy will be there to call him a pussyfor either (a) not bombing people or (b) not bombing them enough. McCain requires ALL of the bombing. If we don\u0027t keep bombing everyone, then the mad dictators will think we look weak! And if we\u0027ve learned anything, it\u0027s that when mad dictators think you\u0027re tough, they\u0027ll say sorry, dismantle all their anthrax guns, and buy everyone a box of kittens.\u000A\u000A 23. Woody Allen\u000A\u000AThankfully, you didn\u0027t have to feel gross for liking a Woody Allen movie this year, because he made Magic in the Moonlight and no one saw it. Does that movie feature yet another man wooing a woman who is half his age? Of course it does. Just to throw us off, Woody needs to make a movie where Justin Bieber nails Cloris Leachman.\u000A\u000A 24. The Secret Service\u000A\u000A\u0022Welcome to the White House! Come right in! Would you care for a knife? Oh, you already have one! Marvelous. Private elevator rides with Obama are every hour on the hour, if you\u0027re interested.\u0022\u000A\u000A 25. Robin Thicke\u000A\u000AReportedly cheated on his wife. Wrote an album named after her to get her back. Literally titled the first single \u0022Get Her Back.\u0022 Sold just 530 copies of the (shitty) album in the UK in its first week. Still getting divorced. The rest of this cheeseball\u0027s career is our collective punishment for making \u0022Blurred Lines\u0022 popular. Let\u0027s ALL get a divorce from this man.\u000A\u000A 26. Sarah Palin\u000A\u000AShe barely even get out of the limo! Some dude is reportedly calling her daughter a slut and a cunt, and the rest of her family is brawling at a kegger, and there\u0027s Sarah in the fucking limo (of course she\u0027s in a limo), letting her Wasilbilly family rumble while she\u0027s probably Googling herself without a care in the world. She only finally gets out of the limo to name-drop herself to the cops! Does she even know she has a family? Or does she think those people are stock models provided for her by GOP donors?\u000A\u000A 27. Dinesh D\u0027Souza\u000A\u000AThe conservative \u0022filmmaker\u0022 was convicted of violating federal campaign-finance laws this year, but that\u0027s not why he\u0027s on this list. No, this tweet is why he\u0027s on the list: \u0022Which is worse: EBOLA, the disease; or OBOLA, the dream from [Obama\u0027s] father?\u0022 There you go, America. There is your worst Obama pun yet. You\u0027re shit out of luck, Obummer and Nobama. OBOLA will wipe the floor with you and then infect you with a blood virus. How do you make that pun and not get immediately struck by lightning?\u000A\u000A 28. Desmond Hague\u000A\u000AFormer Centerplate food-services company CEO. Caught on camera kicking a dog. That sounds about right for a CEO.\u000A\u000A 29. Mary Barra\u000A\u000AThe GM CEO presided over the recall of over 2.6 million cars (in addition to the over 28 million other cars it recalled this year!) that featured an ignition-switch defect responsible for the deaths of at least thirty people. Would it surprise you to learn that GM knew about this defect for YEARS without telling anyone? I\u0027m glad we bailed out GM so that itcould continue to surprise and delight us by making a SUDDEN BLACKOUT option standard on all vehicles. I would have preferred a moonroof, but I\u0027ll take what I can get.\u000A\u000A 30. Cops\u000A\u000A The whole point of having police officers is to maintain law and order, which means they become useless when they decide to arm themselves like a bunch of space soldiers in Halo, roam the streets, aim their rifles at everyone they see, and choke out asthmatic black men. This is bad police work! This is not how you police. We\u0027d be better off arming our cops with lollipops. \u000A\u000ADREW MAGARY (@drewmagary) is a GQ correspondent",

Bono and U2</strong></p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.2">The Tom Friedman of rock and the rest of his band collaborated with Apple to strong-arm their new album into your iTunes library without your consent. You couldn&#x2019;t even delete it! Apple had to send out specific instructions for how to wipe <em>Songs of Innocence</em> (God, that title) off your computer. The worst part was the way both Apple and U2 treated this, like it was some kind of noble gift to The People; in fact this was a $100 million marketing campaign. Yes, $100 million to turn U2&#x2019;s socially conscious dad-rock into a piece of direct mail.</p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.3"> <strong>2. Barack Obama</strong></p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.5">Why are you still on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard?! Missouri is BURNING. Putin is conquering Europe. The CDC is playing nude Twister with Ebola patients. U2 is forcing bad songs on everyone. The NSA won&#x2019;t stop watching me masturbate. I need you ON THIS. Are you even president anymore? When Obama got blasted for golfing shortly after ISIS beheaded journalist James Foley, he said, &quot;I should&#x2019;ve anticipated the optics.&quot; How do you win the presidency without knowing that golfing makes you look rich and indifferent?</p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.6"> <strong>3. Donald Sterling</strong></p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.7">The racist/slumlord/pervert/nudist ex-NBA owner displayed a remarkable lack of power in 2014. He failed to keep his girlfriend from recording him saying a bunch of horrible shit about black people. He failed to keep the NBA from taking over his Los Angeles Clippers. He failed to keep his wife from selling the Clippers to that bald guy from Microsoft. He failed at every attempt to sue his way back into ownership. He failed to win even a shred of our sympathy in a hilariously misguided interview with Anderson Cooper. And the best part is that it all caught him completely off guard. <em>You mean I&#x2019;m not allowed to be a rich bastard who gets away with everything anymore? That&#x2019;s not fair!</em></p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.8"> <strong>4. Carter Bays and Craig Thomas</strong></p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.9">These were the men in charge of the <em>How I Met Your Mother</em> finale. SPOILER ALERT: In a surprise twist, the mom turns out to be dead. Dead! You labored through all those years of Neil Patrick Harris screaming out jokes about his dick, just to meet a corpse. It&#x2019;s a <em>sitcom.</em> Why does it even NEED a twist? It&#x2019;s not as if <em>Cheers</em> ended with all the characters turning out to be ghosts.</p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.a"> <strong>5. Zach Braff</strong></p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.b">Can we all agree never to crowd-fund a movie again? Please? Who are these people who gave Zach Braff $3 million to make a <em>Garden State</em> do-over? Who has that kind of money to burn? Even though Braff is rich, he took the money, and just as he promised he would, he made yet another mope-piece that ached to be taken seriously as art. He should&#x2019;ve just filmed himself rubbing that money on his armpits.</p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.c"> <strong>6. Roger Goodell</strong></p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.d">He&#x2019;s made liking football feel gross and wrong.

Smith</strong></p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.f">He went on ESPN and ranted about how Ray Rice&#x2019;s fiance may have egged him into knocking her out (&quot;Let&#x2019;s make sure we don&#x2019;t do anything to provoke wrong actions&quot;), then tried to explain himself on Twitter and said something even <em>dumber</em> (&quot;What about addressing women on how they can help prevent the obvious wrong being done upon them?&quot;). Did he get fired for it? Of course not! How can ESPN fire SAS for being an idiot when they hired him <em>specifically</em> to be an idiot?</p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.g"> <strong>8. Dwyane Wade</strong></p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.h">LeBron can talk all he wants about righting past wrongs, coming home, etc.... We all know the real reason he left Miami is because the once great Wade can&#x2019;t guard a column of marching ants at this point. His knees are the only things in America right now that are rusting faster than Cleveland.</p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.i"> <strong>9. CNN</strong></p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.j">They&#x2019;re still looking for that fucking plane! Is it in the ocean? Did it travel to another dimension? WAS IT A ZOMBIE PLANE?!

There is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the porch.... And because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton.&quot; It&#x2019;s funny that Bundy can say this while failing to mention that he would like free use of federal lands, in perpetuity, for his cattle to graze. The only difference between him and a welfare queen is that Bundy could point a gun at a federal officer and get away with it.</p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.11"> <strong>18.

But I&#x2019;m telling you, there&#x2019;s something off about this LaBeouf fellalike he isn&#x2019;t everything he claims to be....

McCain requires ALL of the bombing. If we don&#x2019;t keep bombing everyone, then the mad dictators will think we look weak! And if we&#x2019;ve learned anything, it&#x2019;s that when mad dictators think you&#x2019;re tough, they&#x2019;ll say sorry, dismantle all their anthrax guns, and buy everyone a box of kittens.</p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> <strong>23.

Does that movie feature yet another man wooing a woman who is half his age? Of course it does. Just to throw us off, Woody needs to make a movie where Justin Bieber nails Cloris Leachman.</p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> <strong>24.

Some dude is reportedly calling her daughter a slut and a cunt, and the rest of her family is brawling at a kegger, and there&#x2019;s Sarah in the fucking limo (of course she&#x2019;s in a limo), letting her Wasilbilly family rumble while she&#x2019;s probably Googling herself without a care in the world.

Would it surprise you to learn that GM knew about this defect for YEARS without telling anyone? I&#x2019;m glad we bailed out GM so that itcould continue to surprise and delight us by making a SUDDEN BLACKOUT option standard on all vehicles.

This is bad police work! This is not how you police. We&#x2019;d be better off arming our cops with lollipops. </p><p data-reactid=".3plalsgxz4.1.1.0.0.4.1t"><strong>DREW MAGARY </strong>(<a href="https://twitter.com/drewmagary">@drewmagary</a>) <em>is
