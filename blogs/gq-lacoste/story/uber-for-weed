  	    "articleBody": "\u0022YOU THINK OF the top five comedians, we\u0027ve got three of them as customers,\u0022 Gino Gentile says. \u0022The top five singers, we\u0027ve got two of them.\u0022 It\u0027s a Friday afternoon, and I\u0027m riding through Hollywood in Gino\u0027s black Lexus SUV as he reels off his client list. Of the people he\u0027ll name, there\u0027s Skyler Gordy, formerly one-half of now defunct turd-pop purveyors LMFAO, and Skyler\u0027s former girlfriend, a Maxim model named Chelsea Korka, who has a solo album coming out next year. There\u0027s the rapper Mod Sun, who is across town awaiting a delivery. One of those aforementioned singers seems to be Miley Cyrus, who has posted photos of Gino\u0027s products on her Instagram account.\u000A\u000AForty-year-old Gino, with his scruffy beard and Lawn Guyland accent, helps run SpeedWeed, the biggest marijuana-delivery service in Los Angeles and, according to Gino, the biggest in the entire United States. He, his brother, AJ, and AJ\u0027s girlfriend, Jen, launched the company in 2011, and since then Gino\u0027s life has changed in amazing ways. Before this he lived in New York, grew a little weed in his apartment, did customer support for a software company that AJ had founded. Gino spent a lot of time schlepping back and forth between New York and Washington, D.C., which was nowhere near as much fun as sleeping until noon, delivering weed to movie stars and rappers, then partying with them until dawn.\u000A\u000AHe says he\u0027s not overly impressed by fame, but when he moved to L.A., \u0022I told my brother there was just one celebrity that I\u0027d like to meet, and that was Joe Rogan.\u0022 Thanks to SpeedWeed, not only did Gino meet Joe Rogan, UFC announcer and ex- host of Fear Factor, but the two became buddies. There\u0027s Gino in Rogan\u0027s Twitter feed, partying with him at the Improv, both looking blitzed. Another perk: Since Gino\u0027s begun slinging weed, he\u0027s become pals with most of the L.A. porn industry—even dating a porn star, 28-year-old Sabrina Maree. \u0022It\u0027s kind of surreal,\u0022 he says. \u000A\u000AAJ, the brains of the operation, calls Gino a brand ambassador, which mostly means that Gino spends his days delivering \u0022medicine\u0022 to his famous and quasi-famous \u0022patients,\u0022 often partaking with them after hours. See, Gino is a big believer in the healing powers of pot. He claims he gave cannabis extract to an elderly cancer patient and shrank her brain tumor by 30 percent. \u0022I\u0027ve had so much success treating her that I want to shout it from the rooftops,\u0022 he says. Gino also cites a recent study from the UK that showed cannabinoids attacking cancer cells in mice. Avowed tokers love studies like this, maybe because it makes them feel less guilty about smoking copious amounts of pot. And let\u0027s be honest: Most of SpeedWeed\u0027s 26,000 customers aren\u0027t buying reefer to combat brain tumors. But Gino is media-savvy enough to know that he can\u0027t say that, out loud, to me. Legally speaking, companies like SpeedWeed can only market themselves as purveyors of medicine, and Gino is a cheerful shaman in public.   \u000A\u000ANot that weed needs his evangelism. Some twenty-three states have legalized medical marijuana. Four—Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Alaska—along with Washington, D.C., have gone a step further and legalized pot for recreational use. And the only people happier than stoners are stone-cold capitalists. You want numbers? How about $8 billion worth? According to Forbes, that\u0027s the forecasted sales revenue of America\u0027s legal marijuana business within just three years. Welcome to the \u0022green rush,\u0022 as it\u0027s been dubbed. \u000A\u000ACubic Designs, a company owned by Warren Buffett, pitches marijuana growers on services to help them optimize their use of floor space in growing facilities. Founders Fund, a top Silicon Valley venture-capital firm, recently invested in Privateer Holdings, a weed-happy company worth an estimated $425 million. It\u0027s run by a trio of MBAs and owns several businesses, like Leafly, a kind of Wine Spectator website for marijuana, plus Tilray and Marley Natural, two companies selling their own signature marijuana strains. Once the province of twitchy guys with backpacks wearing pagers, weed delivery is now undergoing that most revered of Silicon Valley transformations: disruption.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ASPEEDWEED\u0027S HOLLYWOOD dispatch center is the biggest of its seven outposts, but it\u0027s still just a snoozy three-room bunker overlooking L.A.\u0027s traffic-choked 101, with dingy carpeting held down by used furniture. A scruffy dispatcher takes an order over the phone and watches his drivers, car-shaped dots on a computer screen. A waiting delivery guy does halfhearted pullups from a bar hung in a doorway; another employee packs weed into white paper bags.\u000A\u000AThen the door bursts open and Chris Cope, one of SpeedWeed\u0027s drivers, storms in raging. Was he robbed? Stopped by the cops? No, he\u0027s just bitching about getting stiffed on a tip like some righteous Domino\u0027s driver. \u0022I just did two deliveries and got a cock in my ass!\u0022 Cope rants. \u0022First guy tips me five bucks. Second guy has a $170 order, and he tells me, ‘Hey man, enjoy your Friday, have a nice day, man.\u0027 Fuck!\u0027\u000A\u000ACope is a pudgy 31-year-old from Gainesville, Florida, who moved to L.A. to make it as a stand-up comic, and he\u0027s delivering weed to pay the bills. Spending an hour in Friday-afternoon traffic, then coming back with five fucking bucks—on top of the $9 hourly wage and $2 delivery fee that SpeedWeed gives him—does not pay many bills. \u0022I\u0027ve been telling these guys\u0022—by which Cope means AJ and Jen, who handles the company\u0027s marketing—\u0022that all you need is a little box on the website to tell these assholes they\u0027re supposed to tip. How big a deal would that be? Just a little box on the home page. And maybe something on Twitter once in a while.\u0022 \u000A\u000ACope\u0027s frustration points to another truth of the legal-weed business: Nobody is getting Zuckerberg rich at it yet. \u0022People think it\u0027s like drug-dealer money, but it\u0027s not,\u0022 Gino says. SpeedWeed is projected to earn $5.5 million in revenue this year and will hopefully clear a 12 percent profit margin. (If the IRS allowed companies like SpeedWeed the same tax breaks as other businesses, its margin could double.) AJ is re-investing the profit back into the business, \u0022so we currently have a burn rate,\u0022 he says. Translated from start-up-ese: More money is flowing out than coming in. \u000A\u000ASpeedWeed\u0027s customers run the gamut from tech geeks in Orange County to soccer moms in Pasadena to a bunch of elderly women who live at a senior center—the \u0022ganja grannies,\u0022 as AJ calls them. Growing the biggest weed-delivery company in California means doing the same boring stuff as any successful business: coding an intuitive website, hiring reliable employees, building in the techy amenities we\u0027ve come to expect. If you\u0027ve got a verified medical-marijuana license, place an order online and you\u0027ll get a text from SpeedWeed informing you that your driver\u0027s name is Jamie, he is eight miles away, and he should arrive in twenty-five minutes, based on the current traffic.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe back end of the business is handled by AJ and Jen, who work out of offices in Woodland Hills. AJ is in his early forties, wears blazers with jeans, and looks like someone you\u0027d see at a TED talk. Jen is a brunette with wholesome midwestern girl-next-door looks, a sometime TV actress whose IMDb page lists appearances on shows like ER, The Shield, and Boston Legal. Both smoke on occasion, but they\u0027re not stoners. Jen\u0027s parents are so conservative that she only recently told them about her day job. \u0022My mother cried for a week,\u0022 she says. She tells people that her last name is Gentile and that she\u0027s married to AJ, though when we meet, the two are still only engaged, and her last name is something else, which she asks me not to use. The reason, as far as I can tell, is that however legitimized the marijuana industry is now, it\u0027s still not clean enough to risk her acting career or shaming the family name in public. So I\u0027ll just call her Jen. \u000A\u000ASpeedWeed employees receive a discount on the merchandise (technically a \u0022decreased donation\u0022), but smoking up at work will get them canned. \u0022No one using medical marijuana should ever get behind a wheel,\u0022 AJ says, adding that Jen is spearheading a nonprofit called Businesses Against Altered Driving, or BAAD, to encourage responsible toking. Type baad.org into a web browser, however, and a page tells you the domain is for sale. Try baadgroup.org and you\u0027re redirected to SpeedWeed. Maybe it\u0027s still a work in progress. Or maybe it\u0027s as sincere as those anti-drunk-driving campaigns run by liquor companies.\u000A\u000AClean-cut business types like AJ and Jen, who care as much about SEO and ROI as they do THC, are the face of the green rush. There are none of the usual dope-smoking accoutrements in their SpeedWeed office: no black-light pot-leaf posters, no three-foot-tall bong named James Van Der Bong. SpeedWeed keeps three attorneys and a PR agency on retainer, and has a big-shot chief financial officer. \u0022We\u0027re not messing around,\u0022 says AJ. \u0022We\u0027re building a company that can either go public or get acquired.\u0022 \u000A\u000AUntil then, Jen and AJ are happy building a company your mom would buy weed from. Forty percent of SpeedWeed\u0027s customers are female. Jen says that\u0027s because women like her—professional women, women with kids—might want to relax with a vape pen or cannabis candy after dinner, but they don\u0027t want to visit a dispensary.\u000A\u000AMore than 1,000 dispensaries dot greater Los Angeles—many seedy, illicit little places. \u0022There are security guards with guns standing outside, and maybe a pit bull, and then you get buzzed through three different doors, and you\u0027re walking down hallways with lime green paint and being waited on by these 18-year-old girls with tats and piercings,\u0022 Jen says. \u0022Who\u0027s going to go there with two kids in a minivan?\u0022\u000A\u000ABEFORE HE even launched SpeedWeed, AJ studied the operations manuals from Papa John\u0027s, Domino\u0027s, and FedEx. Based on their examples, he created what he calls a \u0022hub and spoke\u0022 model, putting dispatch centers all over Los Angeles so most deliveries take less than ninety minutes. SpeedWeed\u0027s forty- seven couriers cover a 6,000-square-mile region around Los Angeles and make about 150 deliveries a day. \u000A\u000ABut AJ\u0027s biggest innovation is a clever corporate structure that lets SpeedWeed skirt California Senate Bill 420, a law that says weed can only be sold by not-for-profit cooperatives. Plenty of dispensaries ignore the law and operate until they get busted, popping up later in new locations. AJ and Jen don\u0027t want to play weed-delivery Whac-A-Mole, waiting to get hammered. So they founded a co-op, called Cosmic Mind, and then created a half-dozen other companies that sell services to the co-op: marketing, branding, security, software, logistics, and fulfillment. Cosmic Mind and its delivery service are not legally allowed to turn a profit, but the other companies can—and eventually will, AJ insists.\u000A\u000AAJ can\u0027t skirt every one of California\u0027s arcane marijuana laws, though. To wit: In California, it\u0027s legal to sell and consume edible cannabis products but illegal to chemically extract the oil required to make dabs, which look like concentrated THC brittle. So how are they made? Illegally, while the state feigns obliviousness. Enforcement varies by location. In Northern California, local authorities regulate dispensaries. In Southern California, it\u0027s the Wild West. And that\u0027s just California. Every state has its own byzantine marijuana legislature. \u000A\u000ABut the peskiest legal obstacle to SpeedWeed—or anyone—becoming a powerhouse ganja-delivery service? The fact that pot remains illegal at the federal level. Companies like SpeedWeed can\u0027t ship cannabis products across state lines. If SpeedWeed expands into a new state, it must strike new partnerships with growers in that state. Imagine if Starbucks had to operate a coffee plantation in every state where it wanted to open a store and you can see the problem. \u000A\u000AThe entire weed-delivery industry exists under a shadow. Which makes building a scalable, profitable nationwide business around marijuana impossible. AJ prays that Washington changes its mind before SpeedWeed\u0027s investment money dries up, but not even the weed industry\u0027s strongest proponents expect the federal government to change its mind anytime soon. Uber may battle entrenched regulations in every city it moves into, but at least taxi rides can\u0027t trigger a DEA raid on company HQ. \u000A\u000ABACK IN GINO\u0027S Lexus, we\u0027re talking weed growers. The top-shelf Cabbage Patch buds we\u0027re about to deliver were nurtured by the parents of a celebrity singer. (Gino remains stingy with the names.) Another of SpeedWeed\u0027s renowned growers once played a famous police officer on TV. \u0022The first time I met him, I\u0027m doing a $10,000 deal, buying from him, and I\u0027m like, \u0027You know, this is freaking me out—I keep expecting you to bust me!\u0027 \u0022 Gino says.\u000A\u000AGino has nothing to fear from Officer Weedthumbs, of course. In the very near future, SpeedWeed\u0027s biggest concern may actually be...other SpeedWeeds. It seems like every month brings another challenger. \u000A\u000AUp in San Francisco, weed-delivery company Flow Kana plans to expand to SoCal and beyond. Then there\u0027s Eaze, another S.F.-based weed-delivery start-up—run by a former Microsoft executive, no less—that recently raised $11.5 million from both traditional Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Snoop Dogg\u0027s own investment company, CasaVerde Capital. (\u0022Green House Capital,\u0022 get it?) Eaze is eyeballing SpeedWeed\u0027s turf, too. A lot of people are dreaming the same dream as Gino and AJ. Sure, SpeedWeed staked a claim early and boasts twenty-three consecutive months of growth. It has an established brand. It has Joe Rogan! But the company needs more investment money—millions more, and soon—to survive the onslaught.\u000A\u000AIn California, the new weed economy is fashionable, a hot place to invest, the next big frontier, where the action\u0027s at. \u0022Everybody in L.A. wants to be in the cannabis business,\u0022 Gino says. \u0022Every celebrity I meet, they say, \u0027Hey, you have to meet this guy I know who grows,\u0027 or they know some other guy who wants to invest.\u0022 \u000A\u000AOf course everyone wants in on the game if they look at it from Gino\u0027s vantage point. It\u0027s all hyper-powered highs and porn stars, miraculously shrunken tumors and Miley Cyrus Instagrams. And this is that rare moment—as with Prohibition\u0027s end, or skateboarding\u0027s explosion in the \u002790s—when something rebellious threatens to not just go legit, but billion-dollars legit. You don\u0027t need Justin Timberlake channeling Aaron Sorkin to tell you why that\u0027s cool. \u000A\u000AThese green-rush bandwagoners also don\u0027t see AJ back at the bunker, talking to lawyers, writing code, hoping that the money holds and the government backs down soon and that the next delivery nets Chris Cope a good enough tip to keep him from bitching. They don\u0027t know that AJ occasionally pops an Ambien or a cannabis candy at night, to shut off his brain, so he won\u0027t just lie in bed awake. But why harsh a good high?",

Of the people he&apos;ll name, there&apos;s Skyler Gordy, formerly one-half of now defunct turd-pop purveyors LMFAO, and Skyler&apos;s former girlfriend, a <em>Maxim</em> model named Chelsea Korka, who has a solo album coming out next year. There&apos;s the rapper Mod Sun, who is across town awaiting a delivery. One of those aforementioned singers seems to be Miley Cyrus, who has posted photos of Gino&apos;s products on her Instagram account.</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.1">Forty-year-old Gino, with his scruffy beard and Lawn Guyland accent, helps run SpeedWeed, the biggest marijuana-delivery service in Los Angeles and, according to Gino, the biggest in the entire United States. He, his brother, AJ, and AJ&apos;s girlfriend, Jen, launched the company in 2011, and since then Gino&apos;s life has changed in amazing ways. Before this he lived in New York, grew a little weed in his apartment, did customer support for a software company that AJ had founded. Gino spent a lot of time schlepping back and forth between New York and Washington, D.C., which was nowhere near as much fun as sleeping until noon, delivering weed to movie stars and rappers, then partying with them until dawn.</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.2">He says he&apos;s not overly impressed by fame, but when he moved to L.A., &quot;I told my brother there was just one celebrity that I&apos;d like to meet, and that was Joe Rogan.&quot; Thanks to SpeedWeed, not only did Gino meet Joe Rogan, UFC announcer and ex- host of <em>Fear Factor,</em> but the two became buddies. There&apos;s Gino in Rogan&apos;s Twitter feed, partying with him at the Improv, both looking blitzed. Another perk: Since Gino&apos;s begun slinging weed, he&apos;s become pals with most of the L.A. porn industry&#x2014;even dating a porn star, 28-year-old Sabrina Maree. &quot;It&apos;s kind of surreal,&quot; he says.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.3">AJ, the brains of the operation, calls Gino a brand ambassador, which mostly means that Gino spends his days delivering &quot;medicine&quot; to his famous and quasi-famous &quot;patients,&quot; often partaking with them after hours. See, Gino is a big believer in the healing powers of pot. He claims he gave cannabis extract to an elderly cancer patient and shrank her brain tumor by 30 percent. &quot;I&apos;ve had so much success treating her that I want to shout it from the rooftops,&quot; he says.&#xA0;Gino also cites a recent study from the UK that showed cannabinoids attacking cancer cells in mice. Avowed tokers love studies like this, maybe because it makes them feel less guilty about smoking copious amounts of pot. And let&apos;s be honest: Most of SpeedWeed&apos;s 26,000 customers aren&apos;t buying reefer to combat brain tumors. But Gino is media-savvy enough to know that he can&apos;t say that, out loud, to me. Legally speaking, companies like SpeedWeed can only market themselves as purveyors of medicine, and Gino is a cheerful shaman in public.&#xA0;  </p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.5">Not that weed needs his evangelism. Some twenty-three states have legalized medical marijuana. Four&#x2014;Oregon, Washington, Colorado, and Alaska&#x2014;along with Washington, D.C., have gone a step further and legalized pot for recreational use. And the only people happier than stoners are stone-cold capitalists. You want numbers? How about $8 billion worth? According to <em>Forbes,</em> that&apos;s the forecasted sales revenue of America&apos;s legal marijuana business within just three years. Welcome to the &quot;green rush,&quot; as it&apos;s been dubbed.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.6">Cubic Designs, a company owned by Warren Buffett, pitches marijuana growers on services to help them optimize their use of floor space in growing facilities. Founders Fund, a top Silicon Valley venture-capital firm, recently invested in Privateer Holdings, a weed-happy company worth an estimated $425 million. It&apos;s run by a trio of MBAs and owns several businesses, like Leafly, a kind of <em>Wine Spectator</em> website for marijuana, plus Tilray and Marley Natural, two companies selling their own signature marijuana strains. Once the province of twitchy guys with backpacks wearing pagers, weed delivery is now undergoing that most revered of Silicon Valley transformations: disruption.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.7"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/559ac2772ca2759512988a42/master/w_806/weed-delivery-02.jpg" alt="weed-delivery-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fuber-for-weed&amp;t=weed-delivery-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fuber-for-weed&amp;t=weed-delivery-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fuber-for-weed&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F559ac2772ca2759512988a42%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fweed-delivery-02.jpg&amp;description=weed-delivery-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fuber-for-weed&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F559ac2772ca2759512988a42%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fweed-delivery-02.jpg&amp;description=weed-delivery-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>SPEEDWEED&apos;S HOLLYWOOD</strong> dispatch center is the biggest of its seven outposts, but it&apos;s still just a snoozy three-room bunker overlooking L.A.&apos;s traffic-choked 101, with dingy carpeting held down by used furniture. A scruffy dispatcher takes an order over the phone and watches his drivers, car-shaped dots on a computer screen. A waiting delivery guy does halfhearted pullups from a bar hung in a doorway; another employee packs weed into white paper bags.</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.9">Then the door bursts open and Chris Cope, one of SpeedWeed&apos;s drivers, storms in raging. Was he robbed? Stopped by the cops? No, he&apos;s just bitching about getting stiffed on a tip like some righteous Domino&apos;s driver. &quot;I just did two deliveries and got a cock in my ass!&quot; Cope rants. &quot;First guy tips me five bucks. Second guy has a $170 order, and he tells me, &#x2018;Hey man, enjoy your Friday, have a nice day, man.&apos; Fuck!&#x2019;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.a">Cope is a pudgy 31-year-old from Gainesville, Florida, who moved to L.A. to make it as a stand-up comic, and he&apos;s delivering weed to pay the bills. Spending an hour in Friday-afternoon traffic, then coming back with five fucking bucks&#x2014;on top of the $9 hourly wage and $2 delivery fee that SpeedWeed gives him&#x2014;does not pay many bills. &quot;I&apos;ve been telling these guys&quot;&#x2014;by which Cope means AJ and Jen, who handles the company&apos;s marketing&#x2014;&quot;that all you need is a little box on the website to tell these assholes they&apos;re supposed to tip. How big a deal would that be? Just a little box on the home page. And maybe something on Twitter once in a while.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.b">Cope&apos;s frustration points to another truth of the legal-weed business: Nobody is getting Zuckerberg rich at it yet. &quot;People think it&apos;s like drug-dealer money, but it&apos;s not,&quot; Gino says. SpeedWeed is projected to earn $5.5 million in revenue this year and will hopefully clear a 12 percent profit margin. (If the IRS allowed companies like SpeedWeed the same tax breaks as other businesses, its margin could double.) AJ is re-investing the profit back into the business, &quot;so we currently have a burn rate,&quot; he says. Translated from start-up-ese: More money is flowing out than coming in.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.c">SpeedWeed&apos;s customers run the gamut from tech geeks in Orange County to soccer moms in Pasadena to a bunch of elderly women who live at a senior center&#x2014;the &quot;ganja grannies,&quot; as AJ calls them. Growing the biggest weed-delivery company in California means doing the same boring stuff as any successful business: coding an intuitive website, hiring reliable employees, building in the techy amenities we&apos;ve come to expect. If you&apos;ve got a verified medical-marijuana license, place an order online and you&apos;ll get a text from SpeedWeed informing you that your driver&apos;s name is Jamie, he is eight miles away, and he should arrive in twenty-five minutes, based on the current traffic.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.d"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/559ac2772ca2759512988a45/master/w_600/weed-delivery-03.jpg" alt="weed-delivery-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fuber-for-weed&amp;t=weed-delivery-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fuber-for-weed&amp;t=weed-delivery-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fuber-for-weed&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F559ac2772ca2759512988a45%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fweed-delivery-03.jpg&amp;description=weed-delivery-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fuber-for-weed&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F559ac2772ca2759512988a45%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fweed-delivery-03.jpg&amp;description=weed-delivery-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.e">The back end of the business is handled by AJ and Jen, who work out of offices in Woodland Hills. AJ is in his early forties, wears blazers with jeans, and looks like someone you&apos;d see at a TED talk. Jen is a brunette with wholesome midwestern girl-next-door looks, a sometime TV actress whose IMDb page lists appearances on shows like <em>ER, The Shield,</em> and <em>Boston Legal.</em> Both smoke on occasion, but they&apos;re not stoners. Jen&apos;s parents are so conservative that she only recently told them about her day job. &quot;My mother cried for a week,&quot; she says. She tells people that her last name is Gentile and that she&apos;s married to AJ, though when we meet, the two are still only engaged, and her last name is something else, which she asks me not to use. The reason, as far as I can tell, is that however legitimized the marijuana industry is now, it&apos;s still not clean enough to risk her acting career or shaming the family name in public. So I&apos;ll just call her Jen.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.f">SpeedWeed employees receive a discount on the merchandise (technically a &quot;decreased donation&quot;), but smoking up at work will get them canned. &quot;No one using medical marijuana should ever get behind a wheel,&quot; AJ says, adding that Jen is spearheading a nonprofit called Businesses Against Altered Driving, or BAAD, to encourage responsible toking. Type baad.org into a web browser, however, and a page tells you the domain is for sale. Try baadgroup.org and you&apos;re redirected to SpeedWeed. Maybe it&apos;s still a work in progress. Or maybe it&apos;s as sincere as those anti-drunk-driving campaigns run by liquor companies.</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.g">Clean-cut business types like AJ and Jen, who care as much about SEO and ROI as they do THC, are the face of the green rush. There are none of the usual dope-smoking accoutrements in their SpeedWeed office: no black-light pot-leaf posters, no three-foot-tall bong named James Van Der Bong. SpeedWeed keeps three attorneys and a PR agency on retainer, and has a big-shot chief financial officer. &quot;We&apos;re not messing around,&quot; says AJ. &quot;We&apos;re building a company that can either go public or get acquired.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.h">Until then, Jen and AJ are happy building a company your mom would buy weed from. Forty percent of SpeedWeed&apos;s customers are female. Jen says that&apos;s because women like her&#x2014;professional women, women with kids&#x2014;might want to relax with a vape pen or cannabis candy after dinner, but they don&apos;t want to visit a dispensary.</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.i">More than 1,000 dispensaries dot greater Los Angeles&#x2014;many seedy, illicit little places. &quot;There are security guards with guns standing outside, and maybe a pit bull, and then you get buzzed through three different doors, and you&apos;re walking down hallways with lime green paint and being waited on by these 18-year-old girls with tats and piercings,&quot; Jen says. &quot;Who&apos;s going to go there with two kids in a minivan?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>BEFORE HE</strong> even launched SpeedWeed, AJ studied the operations manuals from Papa John&apos;s, Domino&apos;s, and FedEx. Based on their examples, he created what he calls a &quot;hub and spoke&quot; model, putting dispatch centers all over Los Angeles so most deliveries take less than ninety minutes. SpeedWeed&apos;s forty- seven couriers cover a 6,000-square-mile region around Los Angeles and make about 150 deliveries a day.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.k">But AJ&apos;s biggest innovation is a clever corporate structure that lets SpeedWeed skirt California Senate Bill 420, a law that says weed can only be sold by not-for-profit cooperatives. Plenty of dispensaries ignore the law and operate until they get busted, popping up later in new locations. AJ and Jen don&apos;t want to play weed-delivery Whac-A-Mole, waiting to get hammered. So they founded a co-op, called Cosmic Mind, and then created a half-dozen other companies that sell services to the co-op: marketing, branding, security, software, logistics, and fulfillment. Cosmic Mind and its delivery service are not legally allowed to turn a profit, but the other companies can&#x2014;and eventually will, AJ insists.</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.l">AJ can&apos;t skirt every one of California&apos;s arcane marijuana laws, though. To wit: In California, it&apos;s legal to sell and consume edible cannabis products but illegal to chemically extract the oil required to make dabs, which look like concentrated THC brittle. So how are they made? Illegally, while the state feigns obliviousness. Enforcement varies by location. In Northern California, local authorities regulate dispensaries. In Southern California, it&apos;s the Wild West. And that&apos;s just California. Every state has its own byzantine marijuana legislature.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.m">But the peskiest legal obstacle to SpeedWeed&#x2014;or anyone&#x2014;becoming a powerhouse ganja-delivery service? The fact that pot remains illegal at the federal level. Companies like SpeedWeed can&apos;t ship cannabis products across state lines. If SpeedWeed expands into a new state, it must strike new partnerships with growers in that state. Imagine if Starbucks had to operate a coffee plantation in every state where it wanted to open a store and you can see the problem.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.n">The entire weed-delivery industry exists under a shadow. Which makes building a scalable, profitable nationwide business around marijuana impossible. AJ prays that Washington changes its mind before SpeedWeed&apos;s investment money dries up, but not even the weed industry&apos;s strongest proponents expect the federal government to change its mind anytime soon. Uber may battle entrenched regulations in every city it moves into, but at least taxi rides can&apos;t trigger a DEA raid on company HQ.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>BACK IN GINO&apos;S</strong> Lexus, we&apos;re talking weed growers. The top-shelf Cabbage Patch buds we&apos;re about to deliver were nurtured by the parents of a celebrity singer. (Gino remains stingy with the names.) Another of SpeedWeed&apos;s renowned growers once played a famous police officer on TV. &quot;The first time I met him, I&apos;m doing a $10,000 deal, buying from him, and I&apos;m like, &apos;You know, this is freaking me out&#x2014;I keep expecting you to bust me!&apos; &quot; Gino says.</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.p">Gino has nothing to fear from Officer Weedthumbs, of course. In the very near future, SpeedWeed&apos;s biggest concern may actually be...other SpeedWeeds. It seems like every month brings another challenger.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.q">Up in San Francisco, weed-delivery company Flow Kana plans to expand to SoCal and beyond. Then there&apos;s Eaze, another S.F.-based weed-delivery start-up&#x2014;run by a former Microsoft executive, no less&#x2014;that recently raised $11.5 million from both traditional Silicon Valley venture capitalists and Snoop Dogg&apos;s own investment company, CasaVerde Capital. (&quot;Green House Capital,&quot; get it?) Eaze is eyeballing SpeedWeed&apos;s turf, too. A lot of people are dreaming the same dream as Gino and AJ. Sure, SpeedWeed staked a claim early and boasts twenty-three consecutive months of growth. It has an established brand. It has Joe Rogan! But the company needs more investment money&#x2014;millions more, and soon&#x2014;to survive the onslaught.</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.r">In California, the new weed economy is fashionable, a hot place to invest, the next big frontier, where the action&apos;s at. &quot;Everybody in L.A. wants to be in the cannabis business,&quot; Gino says. &quot;Every celebrity I meet, they say, &apos;Hey, you have to meet this guy I know who grows,&apos; or they know some other guy who wants to invest.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.s"><em>Of course</em> everyone wants in on the game if they look at it from Gino&apos;s vantage point. It&apos;s all hyper-powered highs and porn stars, miraculously shrunken tumors and Miley Cyrus Instagrams. And this is that rare moment&#x2014;as with Prohibition&apos;s end, or skateboarding&apos;s explosion in the &apos;90s&#x2014;when something rebellious threatens to not just go legit, but billion-dollars legit. You don&apos;t need Justin Timberlake channeling Aaron Sorkin to tell you why that&apos;s cool.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.4.t">These green-rush bandwagoners also don&apos;t see AJ back at the bunker, talking to lawyers, writing code, hoping that the money holds and the government backs down soon and that the next delivery nets Chris Cope a good enough tip to keep him from bitching. They don&apos;t know that AJ occasionally pops an Ambien or a cannabis candy at night, to shut off his brain, so he won&apos;t just lie in bed awake. But why harsh a good high?</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1rbxxtphedc.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
