  	    "articleBody": "It\u0027s possible that you don\u0027t know who Jason Clarke is, but unlikely that you\u0027ve never seen a movie of his. In fact, whatever your genre, it\u0027s unlikely that you\u0027ve never seen a movie where he didn\u0027t play a major role. International spy thriller (Zero Dark Thirty), flashy literary epic (Gatsby), smart summer blockbuster (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), dumb summer blockbuster (White House Down)…we aren\u0027t even touching his TV work.\u000A\u000AOK, but still not totally sure who he is? Clarke, who got started in Australian television, is so good at inhabiting his roles that you don\u0027t always connect the dots that that guy is the same one who played that guy. Plus he doesn\u0027t date another famous person (not presently, at least) or ham at award shows (yet) and so he\u0027s managed to be both very successful and still low profile. \u0022At the end of the day, I\u0027m an actor, I\u0027m not here to sell other stuff or use off-screen things to generate whether or not I work. If I\u0027m any good, I\u0027ll work; if I\u0027m not, I won\u0027t.\u0022 He says this without sanctimony, and as someone who has worked consistently for many years but who\u0027s enjoyed the choices afforded by success only in the last few.\u000A\u000AThis fall he stars as mountaineer Rob Hall in Everest, based on the same doomed 1996 climb that Jon Krakauer chronicled in Into Thin Air.Before the Himalayan shoot, Clarke climbed in Hall\u0027s native New Zealand and spent time with his widow and family. It\u0027s clear in conversation that while he doesn\u0027t take the work lightly, he also doesn\u0027t take himself too seriously. He laughs, for example, at why anyone would question doing this summer\u0027s Terminator Genisys. \u0022A big action film? Yeah, I want to give that a go. I\u0027m not at the point where I\u0027m like: Is this good or bad for my career?\u0022 Worst case, he just continues appearing in every movie.\u000A\u000AWe spoke with Clarke from Valencia, Spain, where he was wrapping up a film with Blake Lively and getting ready to go out for paella.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ABefore you signed up to do  Everest,  had you read  Into Thin Air?\u000A\u000AYes, I had. I read it when it came out. I remember I was doing a theater show and it came on the news in Australia. I walked outside and the news was unfolding right then—this man saying good-bye to his pregnant wife from the top of a mountain, and she\u0027s crying and he\u0027s dying. I then read the book, I listened to the audiobook. It became part amazing adventure story, but then part detective story. How did this happen? Connecting the dots. And then I went to Nepal as a backpacker years later and then eventually this script fell in my lap.\u000A\u000AHow did it come to you?Early on Christian Bale was playing the role. And so I went in to meet [director] Baltasar Kormakur about playing Scott Fischer [played in the film by Jake Gyllenhaal], and just to express my general enthusiasm for the project. And we just got on, and then Christian called out, and Baltasar came to me. We met and connected. You know, he\u0027s a big, roguish man—Icelander, a do-it-himself guy, Baltasar. Very similar to Rob [Hall]. A guy who just made his own story in life, his career, himself. That\u0027s what they do in Iceland. You know, similar to Australians. Similar to my own, really. I think it\u0027s an extraordinary tale about what it means to be human, what lies inside of us, and what are the dangers we face being human, and reaching for the stars and creating life, giving life.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve talked about Kathryn Bigelow casting you in  *Zero Dark Thirty* , that the reason perhaps had to do with a certain worldliness you have, an ease in different or difficult locations. I wonder if that was at play in your getting cast in  Everest  as well.Yeah, I guess so. I\u0027ve traveled a lot, so they know I can deal with a situation, shooting overseas. I\u0027m not going to have a meltdown or freak out. With acting, you do want to get every job, and you\u0027re trying to get every audition, but then you reach a certain stage where you start to kind of gravitate toward the stories and the people that have a similar heartbeat. And Bal was definitely one of those guys. To do this film properly it required a guy that was not afraid to be in a confusing situation and to not think: \u0022I\u0027ve got to control everything.\u0022 You\u0027re dealing with weather, you\u0027re dealing with snow. When the weather comes in, or when you\u0027re at minus 40 and you have helicopters and 200 people are sitting around in a snowstorm and avalanche, Bal will never give up. He will adapt to situations. And then it\u0027s an extraordinary cast that he put together. Everyone had that sense of adventure. You knew that whatever this is, it is going to be a good old-fashioned movie that they don\u0027t make very often. You know, the kind that Sean Connery and Michael Caine used to make with John Huston. Not everybody can handle that—the 4 A.M. trek up in the cold, the Sherpa tea and the ice shoes. And I think everybody had an extraordinary time.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re not on social media, you don\u0027t do a ton of press. I\u0027ve been impressed with how well you\u0027ve managed to keep your personal life personal for the most part. I could find very little about you! Why is that important to you?Because at the end of the day I\u0027m an actor. I\u0027m not here to sell other things or use other things to generate whether or not I work. If I\u0027m any good, I\u0027ll work; if I\u0027m not, I won\u0027t. And I think if you go and do all that stuff, people will follow you around and pry and do whatever they\u0027re going to do. I\u0027m not against anybody—everyone does what they need to do. It\u0027s just what I\u0027m comfortable with at the end of the day. At the moment I find the need for privacy in my life and when I\u0027m on holiday, and no one needs to know what I\u0027m doing or eating or wearing.\u000A\u000AOther than  paella.[Laughs] This is the home of paella! This is where it all began apparently. The Spanish love their paella and they love their jamon. And they love their football. We\u0027re going to Barcelona, which is the biggest team in the world.\u000A\u000AOK, one more question. So, I really enjoyed  *White House Down.*You did? [laughs]\u000A\u000AI did! Channing Tatum had a very big movie out this summer as well. I wanted to know if, on the set, you got to see any of his moves?Oh! Channing bust a move? Actually, you know, on White House Down he was getting ready for that wrestling film [Foxcatcher]. So I got to see him throw it down on the mat a lot, yeah. He\u0027d wrestle. He was getting in serious shape for that film. When we did that fight scene on the roof—he didn\u0027t know his own strength. I\u0027m serious. He was super strong. He\u0027s a lovely man too, Channing. Lovely guy.\u000A\u000ABut no skin—no bonus stripteases?No, no. I didn\u0027t get to see the g-string.",

data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.0">It&apos;s possible that you don&apos;t know who Jason Clarke is, but unlikely that you&apos;ve never seen a movie of his. In fact, whatever your genre, it&apos;s unlikely that you&apos;ve never seen a movie where he didn&apos;t play <em>a major role.</em> International spy thriller (<em>Zero Dark Thirty</em>), flashy literary epic (<em>Gatsby</em>), smart summer blockbuster (<em>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</em>), dumb summer blockbuster (<em>White House Down</em>)&#x2026;we aren&apos;t even touching his TV work.</p><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.1">OK, but still not totally sure who he is? Clarke, who got started in Australian television, is so good at inhabiting his roles that you don&apos;t always connect the dots that <em>that</em> guy is the same one who played <em>that</em> guy. Plus he doesn&apos;t date another famous person (not presently, at least) or ham at award shows (yet) and so he&apos;s managed to be both very successful and still low profile. &quot;At the end of the day, I&apos;m an actor, I&apos;m not here to sell other stuff or use off-screen things to generate whether or not I work. If I&apos;m any good, I&apos;ll work; if I&apos;m not, I won&apos;t.&quot; He says this without sanctimony, and as someone who has worked consistently for many years but who&apos;s enjoyed the choices afforded by success only in the last few.</p><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.2">This fall he stars as mountaineer Rob Hall in <em>Everest</em>, based on the same doomed 1996 climb that Jon Krakauer chronicled in <em>Into Thin Air</em>.Before the Himalayan shoot, Clarke climbed in Hall&apos;s native New Zealand and spent time with his widow and family. It&apos;s clear in conversation that while he doesn&apos;t take the work lightly, he also doesn&apos;t take himself too seriously. He laughs, for example, at why anyone would question doing this summer&apos;s <em>Terminator Genisys</em>. &quot;A big action film? Yeah, I want to give that a go. I&apos;m not at the point where I&apos;m like: Is this good or bad for my career?&quot; Worst case, he just continues appearing in every movie.</p><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.3">We spoke with Clarke from Valencia, Spain, where he was wrapping up a film with Blake Lively and getting ready to go out for <em>paella</em>.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.5"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Before you signed up to do</strong>  <strong><em>Everest</em>,</strong>  <strong>had you read</strong>  <strong><em>Into Thin Air</em>?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.7">Yes, I had. I read it when it came out. I remember I was doing a theater show and it came on the news in Australia. I walked outside and the news was unfolding right then&#x2014;this man saying good-bye to his pregnant wife from the top of a mountain, and she&apos;s crying and he&apos;s dying. I then read the book, I listened to the audiobook. It became part amazing adventure story, but then part detective story. How did this happen? Connecting the dots. And then I went to Nepal as a backpacker years later and then eventually this script fell in my lap.</p><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>How did it come to you?</strong><br>Early on Christian Bale was playing the role. And so I went in to meet [director] Baltasar Kormakur about playing Scott Fischer [played in the film by Jake Gyllenhaal], and just to express my general enthusiasm for the project. And we just got on, and then Christian called out, and Baltasar came to me. We met and connected. You know, he&apos;s a big, roguish man&#x2014;Icelander, a do-it-himself guy, Baltasar. Very similar to Rob [Hall]. A guy who just made his own story in life, his career, himself. That&apos;s what they do in Iceland. You know, similar to Australians. Similar to my own, really. I think it&apos;s an extraordinary tale about what it means to be human, what lies inside of us, and what are the dangers we face being human, and reaching for the stars and creating life, giving life.</p><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>You&apos;ve talked about Kathryn Bigelow casting you in</strong>  <strong>*Zero Dark Thirty</strong><strong>* , that the reason perhaps had to do with a certain worldliness you have, an ease in different or difficult locations. I wonder if that was at play in your getting cast in </strong><strong> <em>Everest</em> </strong><strong> as well.</strong><br>Yeah, I guess so. I&apos;ve traveled a lot, so they know I can deal with a situation, shooting overseas. I&apos;m not going to have a meltdown or freak out. With acting, you do want to get every job, and you&apos;re trying to get every audition, but then you reach a certain stage where you start to kind of gravitate toward the stories and the people that have a similar heartbeat. And Bal was definitely one of those guys. To do this film properly it required a guy that was not afraid to be in a confusing situation and to not think: &quot;I&apos;ve got to control everything.&quot; You&apos;re dealing with weather, you&apos;re dealing with snow. When the weather comes in, or when you&apos;re at minus 40 and you have helicopters and 200 people are sitting around in a snowstorm and avalanche, Bal will never give up. He will adapt to situations. And then it&apos;s an extraordinary cast that he put together. Everyone had that sense of adventure. You knew that whatever this is, it is going to be a good old-fashioned movie that they don&apos;t make very often. You know, the kind that Sean Connery and Michael Caine used to make with John Huston. Not everybody can handle that&#x2014;the 4 A.M. trek up in the cold, the Sherpa tea and the ice shoes. And I think everybody had an extraordinary time.</p><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>You&apos;re not on social media, you don&apos;t do a ton of press. I&apos;ve been impressed with how well you&apos;ve managed to keep your personal life personal for the most part. I could find very little about you! Why is that important to you?</strong><br>Because at the end of the day I&apos;m an actor. I&apos;m not here to sell other things or use other things to generate whether or not I work. If I&apos;m any good, I&apos;ll work; if I&apos;m not, I won&apos;t. And I think if you go and do all that stuff, people will follow you around and pry and do whatever they&apos;re going to do. I&apos;m not against anybody&#x2014;everyone does what they need to do. It&apos;s just what I&apos;m comfortable with at the end of the day. At the moment I find the need for privacy in my life and when I&apos;m on holiday, and no one needs to know what I&apos;m doing or eating or wearing.</p><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Other than</strong>  <strong>paella</strong><strong>.</strong><br><em>[Laughs]</em> This is the home of paella! This is where it all began apparently. The Spanish love their paella and they love their jamon. And they love their football. We&apos;re going to Barcelona, which is the biggest team in the world.</p><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>OK, one more question. So, I really enjoyed</strong>  <strong>*White House Down.</strong>*<br>You did? <em>[laughs]</em></p><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>I did! Channing Tatum had a very big movie out this summer as well. I wanted to know if, on the set, you got to see any of his moves?</strong><br>Oh! Channing bust a move? Actually, you know, on <em>White House Down</em> he was getting ready for that wrestling film [<em>Foxcatcher</em>]. So I got to see him throw it down on the mat a lot, yeah. He&apos;d wrestle. He was getting in serious shape for that film. When we did that fight scene on the roof&#x2014;he didn&apos;t know his own strength. I&apos;m serious. He was super strong. He&apos;s a lovely man too, Channing. Lovely guy.</p><p data-reactid=".krb8cam5mo.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>But no skin&#x2014;no bonus stripteases?</strong><br>No, no.
