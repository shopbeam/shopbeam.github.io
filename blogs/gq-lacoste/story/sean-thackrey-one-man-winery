  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABear with me, I am under the influence.\u000A\u000ASean Thackrey relas in a booth at Manka\u0027s Inverness Lodge, a former hunting lodge built in 1917 on the coast about an hour north of San Francisco. He is the reason I have come to this outback, because he refutes what I detest about my country—its obsession with branding, marketing, buzz, everything but real values—and because he makes wine that comes from one place no stock scam could ever touch: his mind.\u000A\u000AManka\u0027s now soldiers on as a restaurant and inn in the middle of the Point Reyes National Seashore, a finger in the Pacific created by the San Andreas Fault, which basically runs right under our asses. The color of life here is the glow of amber that comes off the rustic furniture, walls, and artifacts; the place itself is a kind of monument to the Arts and Crafts movement of the late nineteenth century.\u000A\u000AI am outnumbered by empties. The most recent, a bottle of something red called In Flagrante, stands on the table. We have endured wave after wave of bottles, all poured into rows of huge goblets within my eager reach. Thackrey, a man of 62 with the look of a Robert Redford who has been well cellared, takes another sip and says, \u0022It was in this booth that I first tasted a California Syrah.\u0022\u000A\u000AI snap alert, almost control my slurred speech—by this time, I am in my third hour of dining—and say, \u0022Damn it, there should be a brass plaque on the wall noting that fact.\u0022\u000A\u000AThackrey lets loose a trademark chortle, a drumroll of a laugh that punctuates all his talk. We\u0027ve been through Beethoven and van Gogh and pioneers of nineteenth-century photography like Roger Fenton and Gustav Le Gray. We\u0027ve considered whether his late mother, Kay Thackrey—who perished finally at 103, having just published her first book, a memoir of Hollywood in the \u002720s and \u002730s called Member of the Crew—might have been the world\u0027s oldest author. Been through one of the best meals of my life, closed down the damn joint, and kept on drinking, when we finally get to what matters: one particular bottle of wine that has brought me here to the end of the world on this fogbound peninsula, to a section of the coast that hosts one of the world\u0027s highest densities of great white sharks.\u000A\u000ALet me explain.\u000A\u000AA couple of years ago, I was sitting in my backyard in the dark of night when a neighbor knocked on the door and delivered a bottle of wine that had arrived in the mail during my absence. I immediately ripped out the obnoxious cork and retreated to the blackness of the yard, tipped the bottle to my lips, and guzzled down about a fourth of it in one swallow. I noticed, in my sensitive way, that the wine had a bottom like Bessie Smith in her blues prime. I flicked on my cigarette lighter and read the label: 2000 ORION OLD VINES, SEAN H. THACKREY, VINTNER. The wine, by the glow of my Bic, looked to be darker than a banker\u0027s heart, the label unreadable. I polished it off in a few more guzzles and realized it was the best bottle of wine I had ever tasted. This was yellow-sunshine LSD with a cork. It was red and huge and endless. It was richer than two foot up a bull\u0027s ass, with hints of nothing but endless statements about everything.\u000A\u000ASo I sniffed around online and discovered it went for up to a hundred bucks a throw, and for a moment I considered getting rich and drinking myself to death with a few hundred cases of the stuff.\u000A\u000AInstead, I came to California to meet the mad genius behind this hooch and wound up in Manka\u0027s with Sean Thackrey, a one-man winery who produces about 400 cases of a beast called Orion a year. That means 4,800 bottles a year for 300 million American throats.\u000A\u000AHe says of his wine, \u0022It is complex, difficult, sometimes fantastic, sometimes a pain in the ass.\u0022 He shrugs, a man resigned to being the creator of something he cannot control. \u0022Orion is a plasma, always changing. Sometimes I might say it is brash, then next time it seems tame and withdrawn. It\u0027s going to come out and go its own way.\u0022\u000A\u000ABy the sixth hour, I am getting the drift: There is a world where nothing matters but quality. We live, we die, but if we do not strive for that moment of pointless perfection, we will never have been here at all. Forget the babble of the gourmet or the connoisseur. I\u0027m not talking about that. I\u0027m talking about Lindbergh flying solo to Paris, about getting it right, whether it is a flight, a plate of food, or a bottle of wine.\u000A\u000AThe kitchen has closed, and the two cooks that are Manka\u0027s—Margaret Gradé and Daniel DeLong—have joined us in the booth with yet more food and wine. Margaret, one of twelve children from Wisconsin, rips the filters off her cigarettes as she explains how everything they cook comes from within about thirty minutes of the stove, and so Thackrey\u0027s wine fits their geographic standards.\u000A\u000AShe says with approval, \u0022Sean\u0027s a cult.\u0022\u000A\u000AWe\u0027ve just gone through about $1,000 worth of high-end wines (none of them Thackrey\u0027s; he likes to check the doings of others), and they are all nice, they are all polite, they are all what the wine nabobs call \u0022balanced.\u0022 And they are all—when compared with Thackrey\u0027s Orion—like goddamn dishwater.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWe\u0027re in Thackrey\u0027s old Honda, zooming up the back room of Marin County, the coastal side where cows graze, redwoods tower, and the bad-karma housing clutter of the bayside is gloriously absent. My trembling hangover from the feeding and slurping at Manka\u0027s the night before has declined, and now we are off to find the dirt from which Orion springs.\u000A\u000AThackrey began as a Hollywood boy. (His mother wound up as a director\u0027s assistant; his father coauthored a play that became the basis for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.) He\u0027s worked in the movies, he\u0027s been a book editor, and then for twenty-five years he lost himself in dealing in early-nineteenth-century photographs. As he slaps me with white-knuckle surges on the winding mountain road, he explains how he came to be a winemaker: In the early \u002760s, he moved to Bolinas; ten years later, he bagged a tiny lot and house; and in 1979 he planted a row of grapevines for decoration and thought, what the hell, he\u0027d make some wine.\u000A\u000A\u0022It was like sitting down at a piano having never played one and discovering I was a natural,\u0022 he says. \u0022I thought: I get it, I really get it. I wanted to do something with grapes. It was a pure…something. It was beautiful.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe bought more grapes from a local supplier and made a 1980 bottling he never released. The next year, he made a hundred cases. Alice Waters\u0027s then husband tasted it, and soon it was on the wine list at Chez Panisse.\u000A\u000AThere are only two ingredients in wine: the grape and the winemaker. There is also the concept of terroir, meaning the importance of place and the dirt of the place. This concept means you\u0027ll pay more if someone can put \u0022Ch&amp;#xE2;teau Lafite-Rothschild\u0022 on the label or stamp it with \u0022Napa Valley\u0022 and so forth. Thackrey is annoyed by this concept. He thinks only the winemaker matters, and my God, he is winning me over.\u000A\u000AHe has no appropriate background, of course, no degree in winemaking. He scoffs at such credentials and offers that it is like \u0022expecting a nutritionist to be a great chef.\u0022 Thackrey figures that his career as a connoisseur of early photographs was enough. \u0022I was making a living by my senses,\u0022 he says. \u0022And winemaking was simply an extension of the same.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe explains how, during the \u002780s, two of his wines, Pleiades (at $20 a pop, it\u0027s basically the world\u0027s tastiest jug wine) and Orion, erupted in his life against the odds. After all, he owns not a single acre; he buys from growers and whips up his devil\u0027s brew purely by feel. As the Napa Valley has become overrun by dot-com nerds and movie people, Thackrey has repeatedly seen his growers bought out (wine land in the Napa now runs about $100,000 an acre), the ancient vineyards he favors bulldozed, and his grape supply vanish. But he has pursued this thing in his head, this welter of flavors licking a structure, and like a coyote raiding a melon patch at midnight, Thackrey has located one strange grower after another who continues to tend tortured vines of great age and no reputation. In short, he\u0027s made his wine from grapes no one else thought had much merit.\u000A\u000AWe turn left and pull up beside a bungalow. Andy and Mary Jane Rossi come out to greet us. I have made it to sacred ground. Mary Jane\u0027s father bought the house and five-acre patch in 1937. Andy has been tending those vines for fifty-three years. A mongrel group of grapes with five or six different bloodlines, the vines were planted in 1905 and have never been irrigated. As the gold rush of new money in Napa devoured the water table, the old vines probed deeper and deeper and now have roots at least forty feet into the earth.\u000A\u000AAndy walks out into his vineyard. He\u0027s 82, a quadruple-bypass survivor. He brushes back some leaves and examines a cluster; the grapes in early July are the size of M&amp;M\u0027s. Because they\u0027ve been under cultivation for so long, the vines look like geezers on the porch at an old-folks home. No trellises here; the vines are head trained, meaning a bunch of green mounds spilling to the earth with trunks that look tortured by time. Andy reaches down and plucks a weed—his tractor is in the shop, but he\u0027s not a man to let his vineyard go to hell on him.\u000A\u000AThis is the chemistry of Orion: vines almost a century old and struggling for water, an 82-year-old grower who is not much of a wine drinker, Sean Thackrey late of the book business and the photo world. And the sun and the dirt and time, a collision between two worlds, the world of the rasty old vines and the world inside the head of Sean Thackrey.\u000A\u000AA quail walks past, looking for a bug; birdsong fills the air. The sun beats down, and I can hear Orion rumbling in the clusters.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHe wears black pants, a white shirt, suspenders, cracked-leather work boots, and a vest with the stuffing falling out and the words FAMOUS WINEMAKER stitched on the back. He is crossing the room in his small house in Bolinas to crank up his Victrola and play a 1915 one-sided seventy-eight of Alma Gluck and a male chorus singing \u0022Carry Me Back to Old Virginny.\u0022 A collection of Roman wineglasses sits on a counter; a chest of ancient photos hunkers in the corner. I am in Thackreyland, a place of sharp tastes, old books, rough surfaces, and 300 barrels of wine.\u000A\u000AOutside, casks of French oak filled to the bunghole with Orion and Pleiades sleep under trees. Thackrey lacks the wherewithal for a wine cellar, and so he stores and ages his stuff outside. The barrels are covered with leaves, and the establishment has the look of Appalachia. A mile or so away, in a former pigsty, the cases of earlier years snore away in contentment.\u000A\u000ABeethoven, in his final years of almost complete deafness, had the legs cut off his piano so he could sit on the floor and compose from the vibrations. He\u0027d have understood the Sean H. Thackrey winery.\u000A\u000AThackrey\u0027s eyes are hazel and focused, his body solid and yet moving with grace, seeming to never be in a hurry and yet never at rest, because there is always something twirling within him, the eyes watching, the talk crisp and exact. Somehow he seems present and yet absent, lost to those with him, someone who lives inside wine aging in barrels and periodically pops out to chat with the rest of us.\u000A\u000ARight now he is holding in his hands one of the most significant achievements of Western civilization, a long glass tube called a wine thief, which does exactly that. He brushes the leaves off a barrel of Orion, pulls out the plug, and uses the wine thief to suck up enough red juice to fill two goblets. He is a hands-on guy. He never filters his wine; he drives the truck full of grapes each year from Andy Rossi\u0027s vineyard; he takes the grapes fistful by fistful and puts them through the crusher; he ignores lab-test results on sugar levels and goes with his mouth instead. He reads books on winemaking, but in the end he believes in a simple method: \u0022You learn to make wine by making wine, and I\u0027m still learning. You have to be surprised. You can\u0027t come at it with a formula.\u0022\u000A\u000AI down my goblet, and we move like warriors to the next cask and repeat our deep scientific inquiry. I taste various years of Orion, sipping one that has been in the cask for only seven months and another made from a graft off the old vines Andy tends in Napa—a graft that now lives on a young rootstock. I feel as if I\u0027ve suddenly discovered a whole new school of wonderful music. I taste Orion in all its permutations. The wine is constantly moving, reinventing itself. Thackrey gets to predict the melody, but he knows that at some point the band takes over. I stand in the wind, and suddenly a solo erupts from God knows where, a gale that sweeps through my mouth without warning.\u000A\u000A\u0022I think wine, like life, is better if left unfinished,\u0022 Thackrey says.\u000A\u000AA few more goblets and I want to shoot down the words like the mad dogs they are. Give me that gun and let the killing begin: oaky, hint of berry, undertone of chocolate, vibrant purple hue to rim, ripe plum, coffee, hint of citrus peel. All this is winespeak ripped at random from one glossy rag. Consider it dead, shot between its beady little ferret eyes. Wine is too simple and too wonderful to let these garbage mouths near it. For thousands of years, people with dirt between their toes have made wine, and for thousand of years, no matter how hard people have tried, they\u0027ve not been able to control the process, unless their goal was mediocrity. Anyone can reach the dizzy heights of average wine pretty much anytime. But for anyone reaching for the stars, well&amp;it comes down to a collision between a person and a grape—and if you hire Beethoven to play at your party, you\u0027re going to get some nice surprises.\u000A\u000AWe head inside, and Thackrey beckons me over to his Roman wineglass collection. The glass is feather-light, held together almost as much by the idea of being a glass as by melted silicone. Wine, when made by a truly obsessed person, is much like the Roman vessel: held together loosely by the idea in the winemaker\u0027s skull. Orion, my bottle of choice, is launched by Thackrey\u0027s mind and then goes on to have a life of its own. It is surely the best wine I\u0027ve tasted made by a man without a vineyard or wine cellar who is the son of a woman who may have been the world\u0027s oldest author and who lives surrounded by great white sharks. But maybe I should check out others of like background just to be on the safe side.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhen I finally get home to the desert, I open a bottle of Orion and have some friends over for a sip.\u000A\u000AOne says, \u0022It is one loud note—no, wait, there are other notes&amp;\u0022 and then is struck dumb. She Who Must Be Obeyed says, \u0022A woman has walked into the room with a perfume having a musk undertone, and&amp;\u0022 and never finishes her sentence. Another woman talks about a lover who \u0022leaves bite marks all over the body.\u0022 A fine-wine dealer in New York offers \u0022big and hairy.\u0022\u000A\u000AThackrey knows his product is a product but has a hard time thinking about it that way. He told me he supposed he could get $150 a bottle for Orion, but then \u0022only rich assholes could buy it.\u0022 In California, Orion runs about seventy-five bucks; in New York, a hundred, if you can find it.\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve always been drawn to people who are obsessed with quality and besotted with dreams. Sometimes they climb mountains, sometimes they cook chili, sometimes they make wine. I have always thought that people matter, that they make not only a difference but the difference.\u000A\u000ABefore Sean Thackrey got his paws on his five acres of ancient vines, Andy and Mary Jane Rossi had been selling their crop to another winery. No one thought much of the y lacked a clear varietal pedigree, they were seen as mongrels. The grapes were hauled in a big truck to a place in the Central Valley that sold bulk wine to, among others, two brothers named Gallo. But this is not the kind of crude magazine where I can talk about what happened to them there.\u000A\u000AThackrey\u0027s label on Orion advises, \u0022It will age better than most of us, or can be drunk with pleasure now, depending on your affection for your heirs.\u0022\u000A\u000AKids, you\u0027re on your own.\u000A\u000ACHARLES BOWDEN is a GQ correspondent. He doesn\u0027t drink white wine.",

He is the reason I have come to this outback, because he refutes what I detest about my country&#x2014;its obsession with branding, marketing, buzz, everything but real values&#x2014;and because he makes wine that comes from one place no stock scam could ever touch: his mind.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.3">Manka&#x2019;s now soldiers on as a restaurant and inn in the middle of the Point Reyes National Seashore, a finger in the Pacific created by the San Andreas Fault, which basically runs right under our asses. The color of life here is the glow of amber that comes off the rustic furniture, walls, and artifacts; the place itself is a kind of monument to the Arts and Crafts movement of the late nineteenth century.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.5">I am outnumbered by empties. The most recent, a bottle of something red called In Flagrante, stands on the table. We have endured wave after wave of bottles, all poured into rows of huge goblets within my eager reach. Thackrey, a man of 62 with the look of a Robert Redford who has been well cellared, takes another sip and says, &quot;It was in this booth that I first tasted a California Syrah.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.6">I snap alert, almost control my slurred speech&#x2014;by this time, I am in my third hour of dining&#x2014;and say, &quot;Damn it, there should be a brass plaque on the wall noting that fact.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.7">Thackrey lets loose a trademark chortle, a drumroll of a laugh that punctuates all his talk. We&#x2019;ve been through Beethoven and van Gogh and pioneers of nineteenth-century photography like Roger Fenton and Gustav Le Gray. We&#x2019;ve considered whether his late mother, Kay Thackrey&#x2014;who perished finally at 103, having just published her first book, a memoir of Hollywood in the &#x2019;20s and &#x2019;30s called <em>Member of the Crew</em>&#x2014;might have been the world&#x2019;s oldest author. Been through one of the best meals of my life, closed down the damn joint, and kept on drinking, when we finally get to what matters: one particular bottle of wine that has brought me here to the end of the world on this fogbound peninsula, to a section of the coast that hosts one of the world&#x2019;s highest densities of great white sharks.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.8">Let me explain.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.9">A couple of years ago, I was sitting in my backyard in the dark of night when a neighbor knocked on the door and delivered a bottle of wine that had arrived in the mail during my absence. I immediately ripped out the obnoxious cork and retreated to the blackness of the yard, tipped the bottle to my lips, and guzzled down about a fourth of it in one swallow. I noticed, in my sensitive way, that the wine had a bottom like Bessie Smith in her blues prime. I flicked on my cigarette lighter and read the label: 2000 ORION OLD VINES, SEAN H. THACKREY, VINTNER. The wine, by the glow of my Bic, looked to be darker than a banker&#x2019;s heart, the label unreadable. I polished it off in a few more guzzles and realized it was the best bottle of wine I had ever tasted. This was yellow-sunshine LSD with a cork. It was red and huge and endless. It was richer than two foot up a bull&#x2019;s ass, with hints of nothing but endless statements about everything.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.a">So I sniffed around online and discovered it went for up to a hundred bucks a throw, and for a moment I considered getting rich and drinking myself to death with a few hundred cases of the stuff.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.b">Instead, I came to California to meet the mad genius behind this hooch and wound up in Manka&#x2019;s with Sean Thackrey, a one-man winery who produces about 400 cases of a beast called Orion a year. That means 4,800 bottles a year for 300 million American throats.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.c">He says of his wine, &quot;It is complex, difficult, sometimes fantastic, sometimes a pain in the ass.&quot; He shrugs, a man resigned to being the creator of something he cannot control. &quot;Orion is a plasma, always changing. Sometimes I might say it is brash, then next time it seems tame and withdrawn. It&#x2019;s going to come out and go its own way.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.d">By the sixth hour, I am getting the drift: There is a world where nothing matters but quality. We live, we die, but if we do not strive for that moment of pointless perfection, we will never have been here at all. Forget the babble of the gourmet or the connoisseur. I&#x2019;m not talking about that. I&#x2019;m talking about Lindbergh flying solo to Paris, about getting it right, whether it is a flight, a plate of food, or a bottle of wine.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.e">The kitchen has closed, and the two cooks that are Manka&#x2019;s&#x2014;Margaret Grad&#xE9; and Daniel DeLong&#x2014;have joined us in the booth with yet more food and wine. Margaret, one of twelve children from Wisconsin, rips the filters off her cigarettes as she explains how everything they cook comes from within about thirty minutes of the stove, and so Thackrey&#x2019;s wine fits their geographic standards.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.f">She says with approval, &quot;Sean&#x2019;s a cult.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.g">We&#x2019;ve just gone through about $1,000 worth of high-end wines (none of them Thackrey&#x2019;s; he likes to check the doings of others), and they are all nice, they are all polite, they are all what the wine nabobs call &quot;balanced.&quot; And they are all&#x2014;when compared with Thackrey&#x2019;s Orion&#x2014;like goddamn dishwater.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.h"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>We&#x2019;re in Thackrey&#x2019;s</strong> old Honda, zooming up the back room of Marin County, the coastal side where cows graze, redwoods tower, and the bad-karma housing clutter of the bayside is gloriously absent. My trembling hangover from the feeding and slurping at Manka&#x2019;s the night before has declined, and now we are off to find the dirt from which Orion springs.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.j">Thackrey began as a Hollywood boy. (His mother wound up as a director&#x2019;s assistant; his father coauthored a play that became the basis for <em>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.</em>) He&#x2019;s worked in the movies, he&#x2019;s been a book editor, and then for twenty-five years he lost himself in dealing in early-nineteenth-century photographs. As he slaps me with white-knuckle surges on the winding mountain road, he explains how he came to be a winemaker: In the early &#x2019;60s, he moved to Bolinas; ten years later, he bagged a tiny lot and house; and in 1979 he planted a row of grapevines for decoration and thought, what the hell, he&#x2019;d make some wine.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.k">&quot;It was like sitting down at a piano having never played one and discovering I was a natural,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought: I get it, I really get it. I wanted to do something with grapes. It was a pure&#x2026;something. It was beautiful.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.l">He bought more grapes from a local supplier and made a 1980 bottling he never released. The next year, he made a hundred cases. Alice Waters&#x2019;s then husband tasted it, and soon it was on the wine list at Chez Panisse.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.m">There are only two ingredients in wine: the grape and the winemaker. There is also the concept of terroir, meaning the importance of place and the dirt of the place. This concept means you&#x2019;ll pay more if someone can put &quot;Ch&amp;#xE2;teau Lafite-Rothschild&quot; on the label or stamp it with &quot;Napa Valley&quot; and so forth. Thackrey is annoyed by this concept. He thinks only the winemaker matters, and my God, he is winning me over.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.n">He has no appropriate background, of course, no degree in winemaking. He scoffs at such credentials and offers that it is like &quot;expecting a nutritionist to be a great chef.&quot; Thackrey figures that his career as a connoisseur of early photographs was enough. &quot;I was making a living by my senses,&quot; he says. &quot;And winemaking was simply an extension of the same.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.o">He explains how, during the &#x2019;80s, two of his wines, Pleiades (at $20 a pop, it&#x2019;s basically the world&#x2019;s tastiest jug wine) and Orion, erupted in his life against the odds. After all, he owns not a single acre; he buys from growers and whips up his devil&#x2019;s brew purely by feel. As the Napa Valley has become overrun by dot-com nerds and movie people, Thackrey has repeatedly seen his growers bought out (wine land in the Napa now runs about $100,000 an acre), the ancient vineyards he favors bulldozed, and his grape supply vanish. But he has pursued this thing in his head, this welter of flavors licking a structure, and like a coyote raiding a melon patch at midnight, Thackrey has located one strange grower after another who continues to tend tortured vines of great age and no reputation. In short, he&#x2019;s made his wine from grapes no one else thought had much merit.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.p">We turn left and pull up beside a bungalow. Andy and Mary Jane Rossi come out to greet us. I have made it to sacred ground. Mary Jane&#x2019;s father bought the house and five-acre patch in 1937. Andy has been tending those vines for fifty-three years. A mongrel group of grapes with five or six different bloodlines, the vines were planted in 1905 and have never been irrigated. As the gold rush of new money in Napa devoured the water table, the old vines probed deeper and deeper and now have roots at least forty feet into the earth.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.q">Andy walks out into his vineyard. He&#x2019;s 82, a quadruple-bypass survivor. He brushes back some leaves and examines a cluster; the grapes in early July are the size of M&amp;M&#x2019;s. Because they&#x2019;ve been under cultivation for so long, the vines look like geezers on the porch at an old-folks home. No trellises here; the vines are head trained, meaning a bunch of green mounds spilling to the earth with trunks that look tortured by time. Andy reaches down and plucks a weed&#x2014;his tractor is in the shop, but he&#x2019;s not a man to let his vineyard go to hell on him.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.r">This is the chemistry of Orion: vines almost a century old and struggling for water, an 82-year-old grower who is not much of a wine drinker, Sean Thackrey late of the book business and the photo world. And the sun and the dirt and time, a collision between two worlds, the world of the rasty old vines and the world inside the head of Sean Thackrey.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.s">A quail walks past, looking for a bug; birdsong fills the air. The sun beats down, and I can hear Orion rumbling in the clusters.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.t"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong>He wears black</strong> pants, a white shirt, suspenders, cracked-leather work boots, and a vest with the stuffing falling out and the words FAMOUS WINEMAKER stitched on the back. He is crossing the room in his small house in Bolinas to crank up his Victrola and play a 1915 one-sided seventy-eight of Alma Gluck and a male chorus singing &quot;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny.&quot; A collection of Roman wineglasses sits on a counter; a chest of ancient photos hunkers in the corner. I am in Thackreyland, a place of sharp tastes, old books, rough surfaces, and 300 barrels of wine.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.v">Outside, casks of French oak filled to the bunghole with Orion and Pleiades sleep under trees. Thackrey lacks the wherewithal for a wine cellar, and so he stores and ages his stuff outside. The barrels are covered with leaves, and the establishment has the look of Appalachia. A mile or so away, in a former pigsty, the cases of earlier years snore away in contentment.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.w">Beethoven, in his final years of almost complete deafness, had the legs cut off his piano so he could sit on the floor and compose from the vibrations. He&#x2019;d have understood the Sean H. Thackrey winery.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.x">Thackrey&#x2019;s eyes are hazel and focused, his body solid and yet moving with grace, seeming to never be in a hurry and yet never at rest, because there is always something twirling within him, the eyes watching, the talk crisp and exact. Somehow he seems present and yet absent, lost to those with him, someone who lives inside wine aging in barrels and periodically pops out to chat with the rest of us.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.y">Right now he is holding in his hands one of the most significant achievements of Western civilization, a long glass tube called a wine thief, which does exactly that. He brushes the leaves off a barrel of Orion, pulls out the plug, and uses the wine thief to suck up enough red juice to fill two goblets. He is a hands-on guy. He never filters his wine; he drives the truck full of grapes each year from Andy Rossi&#x2019;s vineyard; he takes the grapes fistful by fistful and puts them through the crusher; he ignores lab-test results on sugar levels and goes with his mouth instead. He reads books on winemaking, but in the end he believes in a simple method: &quot;You learn to make wine by making wine, and I&#x2019;m still learning. You have to be surprised. You can&#x2019;t come at it with a formula.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.z">I down my goblet, and we move like warriors to the next cask and repeat our deep scientific inquiry. I taste various years of Orion, sipping one that has been in the cask for only seven months and another made from a graft off the old vines Andy tends in Napa&#x2014;a graft that now lives on a young rootstock. I feel as if I&#x2019;ve suddenly discovered a whole new school of wonderful music. I taste Orion in all its permutations. The wine is constantly moving, reinventing itself. Thackrey gets to predict the melody, but he knows that at some point the band takes over. I stand in the wind, and suddenly a solo erupts from God knows where, a gale that sweeps through my mouth without warning.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.10">&quot;I think wine, like life, is better if left unfinished,&quot; Thackrey says.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.11">A few more goblets and I want to shoot down the words like the mad dogs they are. Give me that gun and let the killing begin: oaky, hint of berry, undertone of chocolate, vibrant purple hue to rim, ripe plum, coffee, hint of citrus peel. All this is winespeak ripped at random from one glossy rag. Consider it dead, shot between its beady little ferret eyes. Wine is too simple and too wonderful to let these garbage mouths near it. For thousands of years, people with dirt between their toes have made wine, and for thousand of years, no matter how hard people have tried, they&#x2019;ve not been able to control the process, unless their goal was mediocrity. Anyone can reach the dizzy heights of average wine pretty much anytime. But for anyone reaching for the stars, well&amp;it comes down to a collision between a person and a grape&#x2014;and if you hire Beethoven to play at your party, you&#x2019;re going to get some nice surprises.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.12">We head inside, and Thackrey beckons me over to his Roman wineglass collection. The glass is feather-light, held together almost as much by the idea of being a glass as by melted silicone. Wine, when made by a truly obsessed person, is much like the Roman vessel: held together loosely by the idea in the winemaker&#x2019;s skull. Orion, my bottle of choice, is launched by Thackrey&#x2019;s mind and then goes on to have a life of its own. It is surely the best wine I&#x2019;ve tasted made by a man without a vineyard or wine cellar who is the son of a woman who may have been the world&#x2019;s oldest author and who lives surrounded by great white sharks. But maybe I should check out others of like background just to be on the safe side.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.13"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.14"><strong>When I finally</strong> get home to the desert, I open a bottle of Orion and have some friends over for a sip.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.15">One says, &quot;It is one loud note&#x2014;no, wait, there are other notes&amp;&quot; and then is struck dumb. She Who Must Be Obeyed says, &quot;A woman has walked into the room with a perfume having a musk undertone, and&amp;&quot; and never finishes her sentence. Another woman talks about a lover who &quot;leaves bite marks all over the body.&quot; A fine-wine dealer in New York offers &quot;big and hairy.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.16">Thackrey knows his product is a product but has a hard time thinking about it that way. He told me he supposed he could get $150 a bottle for Orion, but then &quot;only rich assholes could buy it.&quot; In California, Orion runs about seventy-five bucks; in New York, a hundred, if you can find it.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.17">I&#x2019;ve always been drawn to people who are obsessed with quality and besotted with dreams. Sometimes they climb mountains, sometimes they cook chili, sometimes they make wine. I have always thought that people matter, that they make not only a difference but <em>the</em> difference.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.18">Before Sean Thackrey got his paws on his five acres of ancient vines, Andy and Mary Jane Rossi had been selling their crop to another winery. No one thought much of the y lacked a clear varietal pedigree, they were seen as mongrels. The grapes were hauled in a big truck to a place in the Central Valley that sold bulk wine to, among others, two brothers named Gallo. But this is not the kind of crude magazine where I can talk about what happened to them there.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.19">Thackrey&#x2019;s label on Orion advises, &quot;It will age better than most of us, or can be drunk with pleasure now, depending on your affection for your heirs.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.1a">Kids, you&#x2019;re on your own.</p><p data-reactid=".1ncwud52bk0.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><a href="../contributors/charles-bowden">CHARLES BOWDEN</a> <em>is a</em> GQ <em>correspondent.
