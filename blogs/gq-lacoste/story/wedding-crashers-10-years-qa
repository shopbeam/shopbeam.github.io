  	    "articleBody": "What would the world be like without Wedding Crashers? It\u0027d be a pretty bleak place, probably: Bros on college campuses everywhere would have fewer rallying cries to shout at each other before and after shotgunning beers; weird, noisy boob-related foreplay acts would remind no one of motorized watercraft; violently needy lovers would have to be called something distinctly unhilarious like \u0022violently needy lovers.\u0022 \u000A\u000AThankfully, though, Wedding Crashers made it to U.S. cinemas on July 15, 2005. And it\u0027s a good thing; otherwise you wouldn\u0027t have that one friend who still, ten years later, loves quoting Wedding Crashers.\u000A\u000ASteve Faber, co-writer of 2013\u0027s We\u0027re the Millers and author of a novella in the new collection The Blumhouse Book of Nightmares, co-wrote what Entertainment Weekly named one of the most quotable comedies since 1970 with his high school classmate Bob Fisher. This week, Faber told me about the origins of some of the punchlines and catchphrases it\u0027s hard to remember a world without—and about where its characters might have ended up after the credits rolled. \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASome of the most quotable lines from Wedding Crashers come from John and Jeremy\u0027s list of rules for crashing weddings, like Rule 76: \u0022No excuses, play like a champion.\u0022 Particularly beloved, that one. How\u0027d you guys come up with it?  Well, I worked for Congress right out of college—for Ed Markey, the Congressman, now Senator Ed Markey. I didn\u0027t have any money. They didn\u0027t pay very well at all. So I was living crammed into an unfurnished condo outside of D.C. with five other people also working for Congress. We not only didn\u0027t have food, we didn\u0027t have cutlery. Knives, forks, and such. \u000A\u000ASo what I decided one day was—remember those old laminating machines, you could make a badge and laminate it? I would print out my name and underneath I would write \u0022administrative associate to Senator Kennedy,\u0022 or \u0022administrative aide to the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\u0022 And these various lobbying groups used to hold these gigantic lobbying events—the shrimpers associations, they held the best lobbying dinners. Unbelievable. So I would bring my big briefcase to work that day, and then after work, I would stick on this big laminated badge and get into these dinners and not only eat and drink for free but at the end—and I\u0027m not proud of this—open my briefcase and gently slide the plates and the cutlery off the table. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest©New Line Cinema/Courtesy Everett Collection\u000A\u000ASo you were a lobbying-dinner crasher.It just seemed like the right thing to do. The shrimpers, they were spending so much money, getting these tax breaks, and all these gigantic corporations were getting huge tax breaks. So I thought, why not donate to a good cause, like all of us crammed into this unfurnished condo? \u000A\u000AAnd by the time I was done, [my roommates], who had laughed at first—well, we had a fully stocked set of dishes and glasses. I mean, when you\u0027re bringing shrimp home in your pockets, it gets a little weird. But I always thought, you really have to go big or go home. \u000A\u000AI see the connective tissue there. Some of these other rules are pretty specific to crashing weddings, though—like \u0022Don\u0027t commit to a relative unless you\u0027re absolutely positive they have a pulse.\u0022 Did this one come from some traumatic experience of your own?Oh, this is a constant problem I have. Constant problem. I\u0027m a very caring and compassionate man! I really am. And of course when you have to say those words to somebody, that\u0027s the last thing that you want. But I\u0027ll say, How\u0027s Aunt Rose? And I\u0027ll hear that Aunt Rose passed six months ago. And that\u0027s humiliating.\u000A\u000A\u0022Never walk away from a crasher in a funny jacket.\u0022[Long pause] I honestly can\u0027t help you there. I don\u0027t remember writing that one. But I guess if you see another crasher in a funny jacket, you know you can come in to steal the show, because the woman that two guys are trying to hit on, she doesn\u0027t want to talk to the guy in the funny jacket. And so you can gently make light of the funny jacket and point her attention toward it, and then have her realize it is indeed a funny jacket.\u000A\u000AThe rules in Wedding Crashers were all about how to approach a woman at a wedding you\u0027ve just crashed that will get her interested in you. For me the big one was \u0022man with haunted past.\u0022 More as a persona than a rule, but a good rule, too. I suppose in my warped mind ten years ago—and still in my warped mind—there\u0027s a connection between somebody you\u0027re attracted to and want to be attracted to you, and having this mysterious past that you can barely talk about, whether that\u0027s for legal reasons or because it chokes you up. Like that\u0027s a big seduction. And actually I thought the best way to express that was, \u0022We lost a lot of good men out there.\u0022 When John says that, you don\u0027t know what the hell he\u0027s talking about! \u000A\u000A\u0022Lost a lot of good men out there\u0022 has taken on a life of its own, I feel, too. Every now and again I\u0027ll hear someone add it onto the end of a story they\u0027ve just told, especially if it wasn\u0027t that funny. \u0022Lost a lot of good men out there.\u0022I didn\u0027t know that had become something! I really didn\u0027t. I\u0027m surprised by that! \u000A\u000AOkay. Next one: \u0022Eye-fucking.\u0022 Your invention?I thought everybody was familiar with eye-fucking! Prior to Wedding Crashers I was working in network television, and you\u0027re sitting with a lot of comedy writers, pitching a lot of jokes, and that phrase came up really early. I thought people knew it! I almost felt like it was cliche. \u000A\u000AReally? I think the first time I heard it was in Wedding Crashers! But in any case, I bet everybody heard it much more after the movie.That\u0027s interesting. Yeah. I probably don\u0027t want that one on my headstone. \u000A\u000AProbably a wise choice. Okay, same question: \u0022Motorboating.\u0022When I was at UCLA, my college roommate had the most juvenile ways of expressing his sexual forays. And one of them was motorboating. I would say, \u0022Please. Stop doing that. It\u0027s embarrassing. You\u0027re fucking embarrassing.\u0022 And he\u0027d say, \u0022Well, how else should I describe it?\u0022 And I\u0027d say, \u0022Don\u0027t describe it!\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027m not one of those guys who likes to hear about other guys\u0027 sexual conquests. Especially somebody\u0027s sexual conquests that sound like a cartoon. \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AI think the Wedding Crashers quote I hear the most in everyday vernacular is \u0022stage-five clinger.\u0022 Did you know someone at some point who described women that way, or did that one just come from your imagination?That\u0027s my favorite. It was in the very first draft, and that one came fully from my imagination. I was in love with that. I was in love with him saying it. We\u0027ve all encountered it in one way or another. Doesn\u0027t even have to be sexual; can even be friendly. Some people, they\u0027re just—they\u0027re clingers!\u000A\u000AI\u0027m still mystified, all these years later, by \u0022Let\u0027s play tummy sticks.\u0022 Is my hunch correct that no one on Earth actually knows what \u0022tummy sticks\u0022 is?Oh, that. That was a throwaway. You\u0027re not supposed to know what it means. \u000A\u000AOkay. Thank you. This feels validating. It implies something erotic and fun. But no, you are absolutely not supposed to have a definition of what \u0022tummy sticks\u0022 is.\u000A\u000ADo you have your own personal definition of it, though? I\u0027m not gonna ask what it is, if you do.I… probably do. And if I went to therapy, it might come up. \u000A\u000A\u0022True love is your soul\u0027s recognition of its counterpoint in another.\u0022 John says it to Claire, then he adds that he saw it on a bumper sticker. Was there a bumper sticker involved on your end?That one was actually an inside joke—if you can call Nietzsche an inside joke. It was a quote from Nietzsche. In comedy there are ten-percenters—that\u0027s a one-percenter. But it sounded good, and I don\u0027t think he knew what the fuck to say at that point. In my mind, he had Googled \u0022romantic quotes.\u0022 Maybe this makes it sound like we\u0027re ripping off quotes from famous philosophers. But trust me, that\u0027s the only time that happened. [laughs] I don\u0027t think Nietzsche ever talked about motorboating. \u000A\u000A\u0022We only use ten percent of our brains; I think we only use ten percent of our hearts.\u0022 I think [this line speaks to how] these guys started overthinking this: What was once an act of juvenalia and juvenile fun became a profession, and when they spot this news that the Secretary of the Treasury\u0027s daughter is getting married and what a wedding that would be, in the context of that quote, they\u0027re thinking about it, not feeling it. They don\u0027t really start feeling until the end of the second act, leading into the third act. \u000A\u000ASo this one\u0027s more than just a cheesy line, then; these guys really are learning to use more than ten percent of their hearts.Well, I didn\u0027t want to write a rom-com. Where everything gets tied up neatly at the end. In the last scene of Wedding Crashers, these people aren\u0027t going to stay together. They\u0027re just not. This isn\u0027t the beginning of an eighty-year marriage. It\u0027s kind of like the end of The Graduate. Those two aren\u0027t gonna stay together. You know they\u0027re not. But it was no longer about their romance; it was about being able to pull that off. Obviously, studios want happy endings. Everybody should feel good leaving the theater. But I wanted to complicate it a little bit. These four people get in a car together, and they could be done in ninety minutes. I think some people got that, and I wanted people to get that. \u000A\u000ASo in your imagination, what happens after they get in the car?I think you can\u0027t take a man whose brain is inculcated with these really bizarre ideas about women and women\u0027s sexuality and retrain him in a week. You can\u0027t make him a new man. Isla\u0027s character Gloria was never a virgin but played Jeremy; she\u0027s a player, too. When two players go at it, that\u0027s not going to work out very well. I think [John] has this over-nostalgized version of romance, or over-romanticized version of nostalgia—and I think he and Claire have fun for a while, and then Claire goes back to being the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury. It\u0027s not a love story about Jeremy and Gloria or a love story about John and Claire. It\u0027s a love story about John and Jeremy. \u000A\u000AI hate this phrase \u0022bromance.\u0022 I can\u0027t stand it. But it really is about the stability of their friendship. It\u0027s a love story between those two.",

It&apos;d be a pretty bleak place, probably: Bros on college campuses everywhere would have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BroBible/posts/10152380426629911">fewer rallying cries</a> to shout at each other before and after shotgunning beers; weird, noisy boob-related foreplay acts would remind no one of motorized watercraft; violently needy lovers would have to be called something distinctly unhilarious like &#x201C;violently needy lovers.&#x201D; </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.1">Thankfully, though, <em>Wedding Crashers</em> made it to U.S. cinemas on July 15, 2005. And it&apos;s a good thing; otherwise you wouldn&apos;t have that one friend who still, ten years later, loves quoting <em>Wedding Crashers</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.2">Steve Faber, co-writer of 2013&apos;s <em>We&#x2019;re the Millers</em> and author of a novella in the new collection <em>The Blumhouse Book of Nightmares</em>, co-wrote what <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> named <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2015/02/09/most-quotable-comedies">one of the most quotable comedies since 1970</a> with his high school classmate Bob Fisher. This week, Faber told me about the origins of some of the punchlines and catchphrases it&#x2019;s hard to remember a world without&#x2014;and about where its characters might have ended up after the credits rolled. </p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.3"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Some of the most quotable lines from <em>Wedding Crashers</em> come from John and Jeremy&#x2019;s list of rules for crashing weddings, like Rule 76: &#x201C;No excuses, play like a champion.&quot; Particularly beloved, that one. How&apos;d you guys come up with it?</strong><br>  Well, I worked for Congress right out of college&#x2014;for Ed Markey, the Congressman, now Senator Ed Markey. I didn&#x2019;t have any money. They didn&#x2019;t pay very well at all. So I was living crammed into an unfurnished condo outside of D.C. with five other people also working for Congress. We not only didn&#x2019;t have food, we didn&#x2019;t have cutlery. Knives, forks, and such. </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.6">So what I decided one day was&#x2014;remember those old laminating machines, you could make a badge and laminate it? I would print out my name and underneath I would write &#x201C;administrative associate to Senator Kennedy,&#x201D; or &#x201C;administrative aide to the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.&#x201D; And these various lobbying groups used to hold these gigantic lobbying events&#x2014;the shrimpers associations, they held the best lobbying dinners. Unbelievable. So I would bring my big briefcase to work that day, and then after work, I would stick on this big laminated badge and get into these dinners and not only eat and drink for free but at the end&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m not proud of this&#x2014;open my briefcase and gently slide the plates and the cutlery off the table. </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.7"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a66eda5f1c7af15a1f2478/master/w_600/MCDWECR_EC016_H.JPG" alt="MCDWECR_EC016_H.JPG"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwedding-crashers-10-years-qa&amp;t=MCDWECR_EC016_H.JPG"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwedding-crashers-10-years-qa&amp;t=MCDWECR_EC016_H.JPG" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwedding-crashers-10-years-qa&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a66eda5f1c7af15a1f2478%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FMCDWECR_EC016_H.JPG&amp;description=MCDWECR_EC016_H.JPG"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwedding-crashers-10-years-qa&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a66eda5f1c7af15a1f2478%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FMCDWECR_EC016_H.JPG&amp;description=MCDWECR_EC016_H.JPG" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">&#xA9;New Line Cinema/Courtesy Everett Collection</div></figcaption></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>So you were a lobbying-dinner crasher.</strong><br>It just seemed like the right thing to do. The shrimpers, they were spending so much money, getting these tax breaks, and all these gigantic corporations were getting huge tax breaks. So I thought, why not donate to a good cause, like all of us crammed into this unfurnished condo? </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.9">And by the time I was done, [my roommates], who had laughed at first&#x2014;well, we had a fully stocked set of dishes and glasses. I mean, when you&#x2019;re bringing shrimp home in your pockets, it gets a little weird. But I always thought, you really have to go big or go home. </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>I see the connective tissue there. Some of these other rules are pretty specific to crashing weddings, though&#x2014;like &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t commit to a relative unless you&#x2019;re absolutely positive they have a pulse.&#x201D; Did this one come from some traumatic experience of your own?</strong><br>Oh, this is a constant problem I have. Constant problem. I&#x2019;m a very caring and compassionate man! I really am. And of course when you have to say those words to somebody, that&#x2019;s the last thing that you want. But I&#x2019;ll say, How&#x2019;s Aunt Rose? And I&#x2019;ll hear that Aunt Rose passed six months ago. And that&#x2019;s humiliating.</p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>&#x201C;Never walk away from a crasher in a funny jacket.&#x201D;</strong><br>[<em>Long pause</em>] I honestly can&#x2019;t help you there. I don&#x2019;t remember writing that one. But I guess if you see another crasher in a funny jacket, you know you can come in to steal the show, because the woman that two guys are trying to hit on, she doesn&#x2019;t want to talk to the guy in the funny jacket. And so you can gently make light of the funny jacket and point her attention toward it, and then have her realize it is indeed a funny jacket.</p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.c">The rules in <em>Wedding Crashers</em> were all about how to approach a woman at a wedding you&#x2019;ve just crashed that will get her interested in you. For me the big one was &#x201C;man with haunted past.&#x201D; More as a persona than a rule, but a good rule, too. I suppose in my warped mind ten years ago&#x2014;and still in my warped mind&#x2014;there&#x2019;s a connection between somebody you&#x2019;re attracted to and want to be attracted to you, and having this mysterious past that you can barely talk about, whether that&#x2019;s for legal reasons or because it chokes you up. Like that&#x2019;s a big seduction. And actually I thought the best way to express that was, &#x201C;We lost a lot of good men out there.&#x201D; When John says that, you don&#x2019;t know what the hell he&#x2019;s talking about! </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>&#x201C;Lost a lot of good men out there&#x201D; has taken on a life of its own, I feel, too. Every now and again I&#x2019;ll hear someone add it onto the end of a story they&#x2019;ve just told, especially if it wasn&#x2019;t that funny. &#x201C;Lost a lot of good men out there.&#x201D;</strong><br>I didn&#x2019;t know that had become something! I really didn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m surprised by that! </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Okay. Next one: &#x201C;Eye-fucking.&#x201D; Your invention?</strong><br>I thought everybody was familiar with eye-fucking! Prior to <em>Wedding Crashers</em> I was working in network television, and you&#x2019;re sitting with a lot of comedy writers, pitching a lot of jokes, and that phrase came up really early. I thought people knew it! I almost felt like it was cliche. </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Really? I think the first time I heard it was in <em>Wedding Crashers</em>! But in any case, I bet everybody heard it much more after the movie.</strong><br>That&#x2019;s interesting. Yeah. I probably don&#x2019;t want that one on my headstone. </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Probably a wise choice. Okay, same question: &#x201C;Motorboating.&#x201D;</strong><br>When I was at UCLA, my college roommate had the most juvenile ways of expressing his sexual forays. And one of them was motorboating. I would say, &#x201C;Please. Stop doing that. It&#x2019;s embarrassing. You&#x2019;re fucking embarrassing.&#x201D; And he&#x2019;d say, &#x201C;Well, how else should I describe it?&#x201D; And I&#x2019;d say, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t describe it!&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.h">I&#x2019;m not one of those guys who likes to hear about other guys&#x2019; sexual conquests.

It was in the very first draft, and that one came fully from my imagination. I was in love with that. I was in love with him saying it. We&#x2019;ve all encountered it in one way or another. Doesn&#x2019;t even have to be sexual; can even be friendly. Some people, they&#x2019;re just&#x2014;they&#x2019;re clingers!</p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>I&#x2019;m still mystified, all these years later, by &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s play tummy sticks.&#x201D; Is my hunch correct that no one on Earth actually knows what &#x201C;tummy sticks&#x201D; is?</strong><br>Oh, that. That was a throwaway. You&#x2019;re not supposed to know what it means. </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>Okay. Thank you. This feels validating.</strong> <br>It implies something erotic and fun. But no, you are absolutely not supposed to have a definition of what &#x201C;tummy sticks&#x201D; is.</p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Do you have your own personal definition of it, though? I&#x2019;m not gonna ask what it is, if you do.</strong><br>I&#x2026; probably do. And if I went to therapy, it might come up. </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>&#x201C;True love is your soul&#x2019;s recognition of its counterpoint in another.&#x201D; John says it to Claire, then he adds that he saw it on a bumper sticker. Was there a bumper sticker involved on your end?</strong><br>That one was actually an inside joke&#x2014;if you can call Nietzsche an inside joke. It was a quote from Nietzsche. In comedy there are <a href="http://thoth-amon.blogspot.com/2010/01/ten-percenters.html">ten-percenters</a>&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a one-percenter. But it sounded good, and I don&#x2019;t think he knew what the fuck to say at that point. In my mind, he had Googled &#x201C;romantic quotes.&#x201D; Maybe this makes it sound like we&#x2019;re ripping off quotes from famous philosophers. But trust me, that&#x2019;s the only time that happened. [<em>laughs</em>] I don&#x2019;t think Nietzsche ever talked about motorboating. </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>&#x201C;We only use ten percent of our brains; I think we only use ten percent of our hearts.&#x201D;</strong> <br>I think [this line speaks to how] these guys started overthinking this: What was once an act of juvenalia and juvenile fun became a profession, and when they spot this news that the Secretary of the Treasury&#x2019;s daughter is getting married and what a wedding that would be, in the context of that quote, they&#x2019;re thinking about it, not feeling it. They don&#x2019;t really start feeling until the end of the second act, leading into the third act. </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>So this one&#x2019;s more than just a cheesy line, then; these guys really are learning to use more than ten percent of their hearts.</strong><br>Well, I didn&#x2019;t want to write a rom-com. Where everything gets tied up neatly at the end. In the last scene of <em>Wedding Crashers</em>, these people aren&#x2019;t going to stay together. They&#x2019;re just not. This isn&#x2019;t the beginning of an eighty-year marriage. It&#x2019;s kind of like the end of <em>The Graduate</em>. Those two aren&#x2019;t gonna stay together. You know they&#x2019;re not. But it was no longer about their romance; it was about being able to pull that off. Obviously, studios want happy endings. Everybody should feel good leaving the theater. But I wanted to complicate it a little bit. These four people get in a car together, and they could be done in ninety minutes. I think some people got that, and I wanted people to get that. </p><p data-reactid=".1mhycew6jgg.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>So in your imagination, what happens after they get in the car?</strong><br>I think you can&#x2019;t take a man whose brain is inculcated with these really bizarre ideas about women and women&#x2019;s sexuality and retrain him in a week. You can&#x2019;t make him a new man. Isla&#x2019;s character Gloria was never a virgin but played Jeremy; she&#x2019;s a player, too. When two players go at it, that&#x2019;s not going to work out very well. I think [John] has this over-nostalgized version of romance, or over-romanticized version of nostalgia&#x2014;and I think he and Claire have fun for a while, and then Claire goes back to being the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury. It&#x2019;s not a love story about Jeremy and Gloria or a love story about John and Claire.
