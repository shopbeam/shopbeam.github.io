  	    "articleBody": "If you ever find yourself playing kickball in a New York City park on a pleasant Sunday afternoon—this is no recommendation that you do, kickball being the quintessence of hipster self-infantilization, but if you do find yourself in such a situation—and if, in the middle innings, a strange homeless-looking man appears and asks if he can take a turn at the plate, do not, as may be your temptation, shoo him away in anger and disgust. That man may be Bill Murray.\u000A\u000AThat we live in a universe in which such rules need stating is the great gift of Bill Murray\u0027s late-stage career. And it\u0027s what went down one brisk day this fall, when a group of twentysomethings playing kickball on Roosevelt Island were suddenly involved in the one-man flash mob that is a Bill Murray Sighting.\u000A\u000A\u0022We just figured he was someone\u0027s dad on the other team and kept playing, NBD,\u0022 one of the participants wrote to Billmurraystory.com, a website devoted to chronicling such ubiquitous and predictably unpredictable events. \u0022The man kicked the ball and ran pretty well to first base, trying to round to second, but one of my teammates chased him back to first, deciding not to attempt to peg the man. That was when everyone on my team realized who he was.... BILL MURRAY DECIDED TO PLAY KICKBALL WITH US!\u0022\u000A\u000AMurray made it as far as second base before getting doubled up on a line drive. He gave everybody on the field high fives. He hugged one player\u0027s mother, who was standing on the sidelines, lifting her high into the air. He posed for a group photo that would soon be all over the Internet. (All this, it should be said, after blowing off a GQ photo shoot.) And then he vanished.\u000A\u000AIt sometimes seems that making movies is merely Murray\u0027s hobby these days, secondary to these kinds of mystic, generous, Dadaist materializations. A pop-culture icon since his mid-twenties, he has emerged lately as something more bizarre and transcendent: a kind of wandering, perpetual performance artist, everywhere and nowhere, wherever the wind or spirit carries him: indie movies, golf tournaments, college frat parties, your karaoke booth right now. As one astute Internet commenter put it: \u0022Some people photo-bomb pictures. Bill Murray photo-bombs life.\u0022 That it\u0027s nearly impossible to tell the apocryphal sightings from the real ones may be precisely the point.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022I always laugh when people bitch about the subways. It\u0027s like, \u0027You have no idea,\u0027 \u0022 Murray says. It\u0027s a couple of hours after kickball, and still wearing the blue cutoff shorts and loose flannel shirt in which he played, he\u0027s ensconced in a hotel suite high above Manhattan. Murray is big, bigger than you expect, and his presence is bigger yet. He brings to even this, the most sterile of rooms, a kind of crackling kinetic energy, whether perched on the edge of the suite\u0027s round salmon-colored sofa or springing up to pour a cup of coffee from a silver tray. He\u0027s reminiscing about his early days in New York, part of a migration from The Second City in Chicago to The National Lampoon Radio Hour, which paved the  way for Saturday Night Live.\u000A\u000A\u0022I got here in 1974, just as everything went to shit. Subways were insanely cold in the winter and insanely hot in the summer,\u0022 he says. \u0022The windows were all open, so you\u0027d get metal filings and dust in your face. It was like being on a prison train, or working in a mine. I used to run all the time. I would get off that train and just start running.\u0022\u000A\u000APart of the joy of the city, of being Murray, was talking your way into places you weren\u0027t supposed to be. \u0022You had to wheedle your way in those days. It was like, \u0027How do I get this experience?\u0027 So you go face-to-face with someone. You make eye contact,\u0022 he says. \u0022My brother and I crashed the Tommy premiere party in the subway, which was like the tightest ticket of whatever year... 1975? We had no business being at this thing, but we knew the guys in the kitchen. It was a party in the subway! People talk about it now, and it sounds like fiction.\u0022 There\u0027s something beautiful about imagining Murray, semi-anonymous, before his adventures were instantly recorded.\u000A\u000A\u0022He was kind of scarier then,\u0022 says producer and writer Mitch Glazer, who was introduced to Murray by John Belushi during Murray\u0027s first weeks on Saturday Night Live. \u0022I didn\u0027t know him very well. He was blazingly funny. But he also seemed angrier.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis is the Murray of legend—punkish, confident, a modern incarnation of a line that stretches from Puck and Pan to Brer Rabbit and Groucho. (Or as Harold Ramis, his longtime, sometimes estranged collaborator and friend, once described it to me, \u0022All the Marx Brothers rolled into one: He\u0027s got the wit of Groucho, the pantomimic brilliance and lasciviousness of Harpo, and the Everyman quality of Chico.\u0022) It\u0027s the Murray whose on-screen persona seems undivorceable from his exploits off. And it\u0027s the Murray frankly idolized by men who were a certain age when he was in his prime, men not overly blessed with good looks, wealth, or athletic prowess, for whom the actor seemed to have sprung forth, as surely as John Wayne, with an alternative blueprint for manhood: self-possessed, on the side of good, exquisitely capable of making one\u0027s way through the world. Several years ago, when I went to interview Ramis, he opened the door to his office, chuckled, and said something to the effect of \u0022They always look like you.\u0022 I imagine that Murray must feel the same way today; guys like me have been coming expectantly to see him for decades.\u000A\u000A So fundamental is Murray\u0027s face to us longtime acolytes that trying to describe it is like trying to describe the taste of salt. It is the root to its own adjective, the answer to its own question. What does salt taste like? Salty! What does Bill Murray look like? Amazingly Bill-Murray-ish. As a young man, he already had what seemed to me the enviable crags and hollows of hard experience. Now that he\u0027s 62, his face is a ball of crumpled newsprint framed by a trim gray beard and a thinning but still unruly shrub of hair.\u000A\u000AAbove all, he remains supremely aware of the effect he has on others, a scholar of eye contact and personal space. It is his genius. \u0022It\u0027s not so much what you do, but the way in which you do it. I can slap you on the back and it can be a wonderful thing, if it\u0027s done with joy,\u0022 he says. \u0022But if I slap you on the back just as you\u0027re coming out of the elevator, and I\u0027ve had too much to drink, it\u0027s a completely different thing.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis is the most obvious connection to the role he plays in his upcoming film Hyde Park on Hudson, which at first might appear an unusual part for Murray. FDR, as he plays him, is a deceptively doddering manipulator of both the big stage (deftly paving the way for the U.S.\u0027s entrance into World War II) and the small (assembling a willing harem of doting mistresses at his Hyde Park estate). The night before, at Hyde Park\u0027s premiere at the New York Film Festival, Murray had sat, with other cast members, for a post-screening Q&amp;A. The thirty-second president, he told the sedate art-house crowd, had balls. \u0022I actually don\u0027t use that word much. Guts isn\u0027t right, either,\u0022 he says now. His voice, with its latent Chicago accent, is like an instrument tuned half a note off, but nevertheless musical. \u0022I should have said he had sand. I like sand because it has gravity to it. There\u0027s something solid down at the bottom. It\u0027s like the clown that you can punch and he sits right back up again.\u0022\u000A\u000A Glazer and Murray became close while working on Scrooged, the 1988 take on A Christmas Carol written by Glazer and former SNL head writer Michael O\u0027Donoghue. Glazer has come to bear the brunt of Murray\u0027s lack of official representation; for many years the actor has relied instead on an 800 number and a voice-mail box on which potential suitors may leave pleading messages. Glazer is known as the man to call if you want to get a script into the actor\u0027s hands. He also bears the brunt of Murray\u0027s pranks. Glazer\u0027s wife, the actress Kelly Lynch, revealed  in an interview last fall that Murray and his brothers call the couple\u0027s house anytime they catch the sex scene between Lynch and Patrick Swayze in Road House on TV.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s totally true. No matter what time, two in the morning, it\u0027s \u0027Patrick Swayze\u0027s fucking your wife right now. Oh... He\u0027s pushing her up against the wall.\u0027 It was kind of funny, the first dozen or so times,\u0022 Glazer says. He calls his friend \u0022the Murricane.\u0022\u000A\u000ALike others in the actor\u0027s orbit, Glazer seems to take such incidents less as the price than the bonus of Life with Bill. He recounts a classic anecdote when the actor dragged O\u0027Donoghue and him to Rancho La Puerta, the tony vegetarian health spa in Baja California. \u0022We were like the only three men there, among all these Beverly Hills housewives,\u0022 Glazer remembers. On the final day, a middle-aged woman guest approached Murray for an autograph. \u0022Okay,\u0022 he told her. \u0022But then I get to throw you in the pool.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe woman laughed and accepted the autograph. Then she dropped into what Glazer recalls as \u0022a civil rights resistance pose,\u0022 screaming as Murray, a man of his word, dragged her toward the pool. He deposited her as promised.\u000A\u000A\u0022He\u0027d made the deal and that was it,\u0022 Glazer recalls, in a statement that seems to confirm the authenticity of the entire Murray oeuvre, real-world adventures included. \u0022He\u0027s always been that way. Even in the beginning. He\u0027s always been...pure.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022I woke up this morning wondering if I\u0027d sold my soul last night to the guy from Focus Features,\u0022 Murray says, taking a sip of coffee and staring into the cup.  \u0022I really didn\u0027t know.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s referring to the studio publicist for Hyde Park on Hudson, who had to wrangle Murray into this suite to answer questions about the movie. The actor is famously allergic to the conventional machinery of Hollywood promotion. Would-be interviewers find themselves acting more like lepidopterists, trying to anticipate his flitting path and then hoping against hope that he\u0027ll alight on a nearby flower for a moment or two. (This is why Murray profiles so often focus on how your profile-sausage is made; for the record, your sausage is made from the frozen smiles and glazed eyes of people like the Guy from Focus Features.)\u000A\u000A\u0022They look at this film as an award-winning film, and that road is paved with glass and razor wire, as far as I\u0027m concerned,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AFor the bulk of Murray\u0027s career, such complications weren\u0027t an issue. Then came his bravura, career-redefining turn in Lost in Translation in 2003—a role that brilliantly flipped the dynamic of his early roles: the buried melancholy and soul coming to the surface while virility and spontaneity became subtext. (It\u0027s both bizarre and telling that the film makes you accept Murray\u0027s character as a onetime action star and sex symbol.) He won nearly every award that year, but lost the Academy Award for best actor to Sean Penn. It remains, it seems, a confusing and troubling experience to him. And now, with his performance in Hyde Park being positioned as another Oscar contender, it\u0027s fresh in his mind.\u000A\u000A\u0022The one time I got a bunch of prizes, I just assumed I\u0027d win them all,\u0022 he says, rubbing his legs thoughtfully. \u0022Because I\u0027d been winning them all. I wasn\u0027t disappointed or anything, but I was surprised.\u0022\u000A\u000AAbout six months later, however, he had a vivid realization: \u0022I really saw something in myself and I thought, \u0027Oh, my God. I really did want that thing!\u0027 Some part of me was disappointed that I got tricked into thinking it was important. I told myself, if that happens again, I don\u0027t want to do that.\u0022 He stares down at the table. \u0022I\u0027ve since realized that it was good I didn\u0027t win, because I wasn\u0027t ready. Guys go for five years without working because they\u0027re thinking, \u0027Oh, this isn\u0027t Oscar-worthy.\u0027 They become paralyzed. So. It would have fed that thing that I found in myself, without my even knowing. It would have been really malformed. Because I had it wrong.\u0022\u000A\u000AA knock comes at the hotel-suite door. Murray has a full arsenal of strategies to deal with the publicists trying to hasten him on to the next in a long line of events that will culminate in traveling to England tomorrow, to screen Hyde Park at the BFI London Film Festival. \u0022Go away! Go clean another room!\u0022 Murray shouts. Footsteps meekly retreat. \u0022I didn\u0027t mean it,\u0022 he says, much lower. He rolls his eyes.\u000A\u000AA few minutes later, the publicist is back, this time having learned not to knock. \u0022So, Bill, we have to go to the thing,\u0022 she begins.\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, the thing.\u0022 Murray snaps his fingers. \u0022I see what you\u0027re talking about now. The thing.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Yes, so—\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You know what we would really like?\u0022 Murray interrupts her. \u0022Ice cream.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Ice cream.\u0022 The poor woman stares.\u000A\u000A\u0022Would you like a little ice cream, Brett?\u0022 He raises an eyebrow conspiratorially. \u0022We\u0027d really like a little ice cream.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027ll see what I can do,\u0022 says the publicist. She retreats, never to return.\u000A\u000AThe question of Oscar is one part of a constellation of questions about where Bill Murray the actor goes from here. He has found a home as a kind of living prop in Wes Anderson\u0027s movies, paring his exuberance down to an almost radical minimalism. Films like The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, in which he played a fractured Jacques Cousteau, are closer to comedies than they might appear, Murray says, as intellectually tuned to the dynamics of comedy as he is instinctive. \u0022Every single scene of that movie was funny, but when Wes assembled it, he streamlined and excised the detonation point of the laughter. The idea is you keep it bouncing and never skim the energy off of it. You keep it building in the name of a big emotional payoff—which comes when they\u0027re all in the submarine together and they see the jaguar shark.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s made an easy accommodation to Anderson\u0027s tightly controlled style, a distinct contrast to the freewheeling improvisation of his younger days. \u0022Wes really knows what he wants. It\u0027s not like, \u0027Get the ham out there and let him oink,\u0027 \u0022 he says. \u0022Those limitations make it more challenging: \u0027If I have to be in this box, how do I make it work? What can I do to make it really zip?\u0027 \u0022 In last year\u0027s Moonrise Kingdom, he delivered as zippy and soulful a performance for Anderson as he has since the sublimity of Rushmore, their first project together. Reports from the Rome Film Festival, where Roman Coppola\u0027s feature A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III debuted in November, suggest he does the same alongside Charlie Sheen.\u000A\u000AAnd yet, for the past decade, the one area Murray has failed to find an assured place is in comedies that announce themselves as comedies. When I ask why, he\u0027s silent for a full fifteen seconds. \u0022They\u0027re different,\u0022 he says finally. \u0022They\u0027re just different from what I used to do.\u0022 He\u0027s right. On the surface—and, one suspects, in the minds of their makers—movies like The Hangover and Knocked Up are directly in the lineage of Murray\u0027s classics: Meatballs, Stripes, Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day. But if those earlier movies are about being a man and negotiating the world, the dominant theme of the newer ones is about avoiding it, staying a boy—albeit a boy raised on the films of Bill Murray.\u000A\u000AGlazer says Murray is continually approached by comedy directors but has found few projects he feels are worth doing. \u0022I assume if he found them amusing, he\u0027d do them,\u0022 he says. (One exception that Murray is particularly fond of was Zombieland, in which he played himself during the zombie apocalypse, the conceit being that he donned zombie drag in order to move about freely, a not-terrible metaphor for his relationship to the straight, non-Murray world now.)\u000A\u000A Still, comedy appears to be something the actor genuinely misses. \u0022The early movies, we just did them for fun. If they were funny, you did them. There wasn\u0027t this life-or-death thing,\u0022 he says. \u0022I was in movies where I would turn up, and they\u0027d be like, \u0027Whaddya got?\u0027 It was like, \u0027Turn on two cameras and let\u0027s go.\u0027 \u0022 In this light, it\u0027s hard not to see his recent mode of real-life exploits as the ercise of a disused muscle, a way to do off the screen what he no longer gets the chance to do on it.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s really a question I have. I think there\u0027s something that I can bring to a comedy today, but I don\u0027t know where to bring it,\u0022 he says. \u0022I\u0027ve actually thought about having a manager again. Just to clear my head and have a plan.\u0022 He pauses, as if working it out in his mind. \u0022Eh, it\u0027s not that attractive to have a plan. I know that if I ever feel that I need to make a funny movie, I\u0027ll figure out how to write one. I\u0027ll get it done. If I ever get some ambition, I\u0027m gonna get some shit done.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe does a mock-offended eye roll/blink. \u0022What? It could happen.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIt could. And, maybe selfishly, I wish it would. Not because Murray\u0027s later performances, on- and offscreen, aren\u0027t full of delights, but because the notion of his passing into a genteel old age of masterful but dutiful roles in Oscar movies would—not to make too much of it—feel like something akin to the death of the universe.\u000A\u000ADuring the Hyde Park Q&amp;A, a tactful young cineast had risen to ask about a scene in which FDR goes for a swim, his crippled body suddenly graceful in water, the camera regarding his wasted legs as they float by. What kinds of special effects, the questioner wanted to know, were used to make those legs quite so unbelievably gnarled and horrible looking?\u000A\u000AIt was immediately clear, from the laughter among the others onstage, that the answer was none. Murray was silent for a long moment and then reached down for that fathomless gear of deadpan to which perhaps only he, since Buster Keaton, has access. \u0022That,\u0022 he said finally, \u0022is acting.\u0022\u000A\u000ANow he tells the story of his morning on Roosevelt Island—except not about the kickball game. I will have to learn about that later, on the Internet. Instead, he talks about the original reason for the trip, where he went first: to see the recently completed FDR Four Freedoms memorial, located on the tip of the island (where, he mentions, an unfilmed scene in Ghostbusters was meant to be set). He had seen a documentary about the project on PBS and, having recently channeled the president, decided to take his sons and their friends for a look.\u000A\u000A \u0022It was designed by Louis Kahn, and it\u0027s got some moves,\u0022 he says, flipping through photos on his phone and shaking his head, impressed. \u0022This is what they call The Room,\u0022 he says, passing the phone. \u0022There\u0027s six-by-six-by-twelve-foot granite blocks with a tiny bit of space between them that\u0027s polished on the inside, so the light actually kicks through the whole thing. The Room is pretty boss.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe only problem was that the memorial was in the final stages of construction and not yet open, so they crept around the edges, looking for a way in. A perfect setup for a little of that Murray magic.\u000A\u000A \u0022I waved to the people driving in and out in their itty-bitty cars, and eventually I saw one of the guys walking back, saying, \u0027They said you were out here.\u0027 \u0022 Murray seems suddenly sheepish, as if hearing how it sounds: just another celebrity getting through doors on the strength of his face—not with wit and charm and guile, not with sand.\u000A\u000A\u0022It wasn\u0027t like they were like, \u0027Hey, you\u0027re the guy from What About Bob?\u0027 or anything. One guy didn\u0027t speak very much English, and they obviously weren\u0027t really movie buffs...,\u0022 he says, rubbing those legs gingerly. A mere guard, he\u0027ll have you know, is still no match for the power of the Murricane. He\u0027d have made it through the gate.\u000A\u000A\u0022I had that,\u0022 he says with perfect confidence. \u0022If I had a little more time, I could have gotten it done.\u0022\u000A\u000A  Brett Martin is a GQ correspondent.",

were a comedian, acclaimed actor, and beloved personality who&#39;s become famous for crashing kickball games, prank-calling his friends&#39; wives, and busting into the karaoke rooms of gobsmacked (and delighted) constituents. And yet now here&#39;s Bill Murray playing FDR, bantering through a Hyde Park accent and cigarette holder, batting away murmurs of another Oscar nomination. But has the comic giant just gotten too damn beloved and too damn acclaimed for his own liking?</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.0">If you ever find yourself playing kickball in a New York City park on a pleasant Sunday afternoon&#x2014;this is no recommendation that you do, kickball being the quintessence of hipster self-infantilization, but if you do find yourself in such a situation&#x2014;and if, in the middle innings, a strange homeless-looking man appears and asks if he can take a turn at the plate, do not, as may be your temptation, shoo him away in anger and disgust. That man may be Bill Murray.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.1">That we live in a universe in which such rules need stating is the great gift of Bill Murray&#x2019;s late-stage career. And it&#x2019;s what went down one brisk day this fall, when a group of twentysomethings playing kickball on Roosevelt Island were suddenly involved in the one-man flash mob that is a Bill Murray Sighting.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.2">&quot;We just figured he was someone&#x2019;s dad on the other team and kept playing, NBD,&quot; one of the participants wrote to Billmurraystory.com, a website devoted to chronicling such ubiquitous and predictably unpredictable events. &quot;The man kicked the ball and ran pretty well to first base, trying to round to second, but one of my teammates chased him back to first, deciding not to attempt to peg the man. That was when everyone on my team realized who he was.... BILL MURRAY DECIDED TO PLAY KICKBALL WITH US!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.3">Murray made it as far as second base before getting doubled up on a line drive. He gave everybody on the field high fives. He hugged one player&#x2019;s mother, who was standing on the sidelines, lifting her high into the air. He posed for a group photo that would soon be all over the Internet. (All this, it should be said, after blowing off a <em>GQ</em> photo shoot.) And then he vanished.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.5">It sometimes seems that making movies is merely Murray&#x2019;s hobby these days, secondary to these kinds of mystic, generous, Dadaist materializations. A pop-culture icon since his mid-twenties, he has emerged lately as something more bizarre and transcendent: a kind of wandering, perpetual performance artist, everywhere and nowhere, wherever the wind or spirit carries him: indie movies, golf tournaments, college frat parties, <em>your</em> karaoke booth <em>right now.</em> As one astute Internet commenter put it: &quot;Some people photo-bomb pictures. Bill Murray photo-bombs life.&quot; That it&#x2019;s nearly impossible to tell the apocryphal sightings from the real ones may be precisely the point.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.6"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.7">&quot;I always laugh when people bitch about the subways. It&#x2019;s like, &#x2019;You have <em>no idea,</em>&#x2019; &quot; Murray says. It&#x2019;s a couple of hours after kickball, and still wearing the blue cutoff shorts and loose flannel shirt in which he played, he&#x2019;s ensconced in a hotel suite high above Manhattan. Murray is big, bigger than you expect, and his presence is bigger yet. He brings to even this, the most sterile of rooms, a kind of crackling kinetic energy, whether perched on the edge of the suite&#x2019;s round salmon-colored sofa or springing up to pour a cup of coffee from a silver tray. He&#x2019;s reminiscing about his early days in New York, part of a migration from The Second City in Chicago to <em>The National Lampoon Radio Hour,</em> which paved the  way for <em>Saturday Night Live</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.8">&quot;I got here in 1974, just as everything went to shit. Subways were insanely cold in the winter and insanely hot in the summer,&quot; he says. &quot;The windows were all open, so you&#x2019;d get metal filings and dust in your face. It was like being on a prison train, or working in a mine. I used to run all the time. I would get off that train and just start running.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.9">Part of the joy of the city, of being Murray, was talking your way into places you weren&#x2019;t supposed to be. &quot;You had to wheedle your way in those days. It was like, &#x2019;How do I get this experience?&#x2019; So you go face-to-face with someone. You make eye contact,&quot; he says. &quot;My brother and I crashed the<em> Tommy</em> premiere party in the subway, which was like the tightest ticket of whatever year... 1975? We had no business being at this thing, but we knew the guys in the kitchen. It was a party in the subway! People talk about it now, and it sounds like fiction.&quot; There&#x2019;s something beautiful about imagining Murray, semi-anonymous, before his adventures were instantly recorded.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.a">&quot;He was kind of scarier then,&quot; says producer and writer Mitch Glazer, who was introduced to Murray by John Belushi during Murray&#x2019;s first weeks on <em>Saturday Night Live.</em> &quot;I didn&#x2019;t know him very well. He was blazingly funny. But he also seemed angrier.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.b">This is the Murray of legend&#x2014;punkish, confident, a modern incarnation of a line that stretches from Puck and Pan to Brer Rabbit and Groucho. (Or as Harold Ramis, his longtime, sometimes estranged collaborator and friend, once described it to me, &quot;<em>All</em> the Marx Brothers rolled into one: He&#x2019;s got the wit of Groucho, the pantomimic brilliance and lasciviousness of Harpo, and the Everyman quality of Chico.&quot;) It&#x2019;s the Murray whose on-screen persona seems undivorceable from his exploits off. And it&#x2019;s the Murray frankly idolized by men who were a certain age when he was in his prime, men not overly blessed with good looks, wealth, or athletic prowess, for whom the actor seemed to have sprung forth, as surely as John Wayne, with an alternative blueprint for manhood: self-possessed, on the side of good, exquisitely capable of making one&#x2019;s way through the world. Several years ago, when I went to interview Ramis, he opened the door to his office, chuckled, and said something to the effect of &quot;They always look like you.&quot; I imagine that Murray must feel the same way today; guys like me have been coming expectantly to see him for decades.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.c"> So fundamental is Murray&#x2019;s face to us longtime acolytes that trying to describe it is like trying to describe the taste of salt. It is the root to its own adjective, the answer to its own question. What does salt taste like? Salty! What does Bill Murray look like? Amazingly <em>Bill-Murray-ish</em>. As a young man, he already had what seemed to me the enviable crags and hollows of hard experience. Now that he&#x2019;s 62, his face is a ball of crumpled newsprint framed by a trim gray beard and a thinning but still unruly shrub of hair.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.d">Above all, he remains supremely aware of the effect he has on others, a scholar of eye contact and personal space. It is his genius. &quot;It&#x2019;s not so much what you do, but the way in which you do it. I can slap you on the back and it can be a wonderful thing, if it&#x2019;s done with joy,&quot; he says. &quot;But if I slap you on the back just as you&#x2019;re coming out of the elevator, and I&#x2019;ve had too much to drink, it&#x2019;s a completely different thing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.e">This is the most obvious connection to the role he plays in his upcoming film <em>Hyde Park on Hudson, </em>which at first might appear an unusual part for Murray. FDR, as he plays him, is a deceptively doddering manipulator of both the big stage (deftly paving the way for the U.S.&#x2019;s entrance into World War II) and the small (assembling a willing harem of doting mistresses at his Hyde Park estate). The night before, at <em>Hyde Park&#x2019;</em>s premiere at the New York Film Festival, Murray had sat, with other cast members, for a post-screening Q&amp;A. The thirty-second president, he told the sedate art-house crowd, had <em>balls.</em> &quot;I actually don&#x2019;t use that word much. <em>Guts</em> isn&#x2019;t right, either,&quot; he says now. His voice, with its latent Chicago accent, is like an instrument tuned half a note off, but nevertheless musical. &quot;I should have said he had <em>sand</em>. I like <em>sand</em> because it has gravity to it. There&#x2019;s something solid down at the bottom. It&#x2019;s like the clown that you can punch and he sits right back up again.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.f"> Glazer and Murray became close while working on <em>Scrooged,</em> the 1988 take on <em>A Christmas Carol</em> written by Glazer and former <em>SNL</em> head writer Michael O&#x2019;Donoghue. Glazer has come to bear the brunt of Murray&#x2019;s lack of official representation; for many years the actor has relied instead on an 800 number and a voice-mail box on which potential suitors may leave pleading messages. Glazer is known as the man to call if you want to get a script into the actor&#x2019;s hands. He also bears the brunt of Murray&#x2019;s pranks. Glazer&#x2019;s wife, the actress Kelly Lynch, revealed  in an interview last fall that Murray and his brothers call the couple&#x2019;s house anytime they catch the sex scene between Lynch and Patrick Swayze in <em>Road House</em> on TV.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.g">&quot;It&#x2019;s totally true. No matter what time, two in the morning, it&#x2019;s &#x2019;Patrick Swayze&#x2019;s fucking your wife right now. Oh... He&#x2019;s pushing her up against the wall.&#x2019; It was kind of funny, the first dozen or so times,&quot; Glazer says. He calls his friend &quot;the Murricane.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.h">Like others in the actor&#x2019;s orbit, Glazer seems to take such incidents less as the price than the bonus of Life with Bill. He recounts a classic anecdote when the actor dragged O&#x2019;Donoghue and him to Rancho La Puerta, the tony vegetarian health spa in Baja California. &quot;We were like the only three men there, among all these Beverly Hills housewives,&quot; Glazer remembers. On the final day, a middle-aged woman guest approached Murray for an autograph. &quot;Okay,&quot; he told her. &quot;But then I get to throw you in the pool.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.i">The woman laughed and accepted the autograph. Then she dropped into what Glazer recalls as &quot;a civil rights resistance pose,&quot; screaming as Murray, a man of his word, dragged her toward the pool. He deposited her as promised.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.j">&quot;He&#x2019;d made the deal and that was it,&quot; Glazer recalls, in a statement that seems to confirm the authenticity of the entire Murray oeuvre, real-world adventures included. &quot;He&#x2019;s always been that way. Even in the beginning. He&#x2019;s always been...pure.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.k"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.l">&quot;I woke up this morning wondering if I&#x2019;d sold my soul last night to the guy from Focus Features,&quot; Murray says, taking a sip of coffee and staring into the cup.  &quot;I really didn&#x2019;t know.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.m">He&#x2019;s referring to the studio publicist for <em>Hyde Park on Hudson,</em> who had to wrangle Murray into this suite to answer questions about the movie. The actor is famously allergic to the conventional machinery of Hollywood promotion. Would-be interviewers find themselves acting more like lepidopterists, trying to anticipate his flitting path and then hoping against hope that he&#x2019;ll alight on a nearby flower for a moment or two. (This is why Murray profiles so often focus on how your profile-sausage is made; for the record, your sausage is made from the frozen smiles and glazed eyes of people like the Guy from Focus Features.)</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.n">&quot;They look at this film as an award-winning film, and that road is paved with glass and razor wire, as far as I&#x2019;m concerned,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.o">For the bulk of Murray&#x2019;s career, such complications weren&#x2019;t an issue. Then came his bravura, career-redefining turn in <em>Lost in Translation</em> in 2003&#x2014;a role that brilliantly flipped the dynamic of his early roles: the buried melancholy and soul coming to the surface while virility and spontaneity became subtext. (It&#x2019;s both bizarre and telling that the film makes you accept Murray&#x2019;s character as a onetime action star and sex symbol.) He won nearly every award that year, but lost the Academy Award for best actor to Sean Penn. It remains, it seems, a confusing and troubling experience to him. And now, with his performance in <em>Hyde Park</em> being positioned as another Oscar contender, it&#x2019;s fresh in his mind.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.p">&quot;The one time I got a bunch of prizes, I just assumed I&#x2019;d win them all,&quot; he says, rubbing his legs thoughtfully. &quot;Because I&#x2019;d <em>been</em> winning them all. I wasn&#x2019;t disappointed or anything, but I was surprised.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.q">About six months later, however, he had a vivid realization: &quot;I really saw something in myself and I thought, &#x2019;Oh, my God. I really did want that thing!&#x2019; Some part of me was disappointed that I got tricked into thinking it was important. I told myself, if that happens again, I don&#x2019;t want to do that.&quot; He stares down at the table. &quot;I&#x2019;ve since realized that it was good I didn&#x2019;t win, because I wasn&#x2019;t ready. Guys go for five years without working because they&#x2019;re thinking, &#x2019;Oh, this isn&#x2019;t Oscar-worthy.&#x2019; They become paralyzed. So. It would have fed that thing that I found in myself, without my even knowing. It would have been really malformed. Because I had it wrong.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.r">A knock comes at the hotel-suite door. Murray has a full arsenal of strategies to deal with the publicists trying to hasten him on to the next in a long line of events that will culminate in traveling to England tomorrow, to screen <em>Hyde Park</em> at the BFI London Film Festival. &quot;Go away! Go clean another room!&quot; Murray shouts. Footsteps meekly retreat. &quot;I didn&#x2019;t mean it,&quot; he says, much lower. He rolls his eyes.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.s">A few minutes later, the publicist is back, this time having learned not to knock. &quot;So, Bill, we have to go to the thing,&quot; she begins.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.t">&quot;Oh, the <em>thing.</em>&quot; Murray snaps his fingers. &quot;I see what you&#x2019;re talking about now. The thing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.u">&quot;Yes, so&#x2014;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.v">&quot;You know what we would really like?&quot; Murray interrupts her. &quot;Ice cream.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.w">&quot;Ice cream.&quot; The poor woman stares.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.x">&quot;Would you like a little ice cream, Brett?&quot; He raises an eyebrow conspiratorially. &quot;We&#x2019;d really like a little ice cream.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.y"> &quot;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do,&quot; says the publicist. She retreats, never to return.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.z">The question of Oscar is one part of a constellation of questions about where Bill Murray the actor goes from here. He has found a home as a kind of living prop in Wes Anderson&#x2019;s movies, paring his exuberance down to an almost radical minimalism. Films like <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,</em> in which he played a fractured Jacques Cousteau, are closer to comedies than they might appear, Murray says, as intellectually tuned to the dynamics of comedy as he is instinctive. &quot;Every single scene of that movie was funny, but when Wes assembled it, he streamlined and excised the detonation point of the laughter. The idea is you keep it bouncing and never skim the energy off of it. You keep it building in the name of a big emotional payoff&#x2014;which comes when they&#x2019;re all in the submarine together and they see the jaguar shark.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.10">He&#x2019;s made an easy accommodation to Anderson&#x2019;s tightly controlled style, a distinct contrast to the freewheeling improvisation of his younger days. &quot;Wes really knows what he wants. It&#x2019;s not like, &#x2019;Get the ham out there and let him oink,&#x2019; &quot; he says. &quot;Those limitations make it more challenging: &#x2019;If I have to be in this box, how do I make it work? What can I do to make it really zip?&#x2019; &quot; In last year&#x2019;s <em>Moonrise Kingdom,</em> he delivered as zippy and soulful a performance for Anderson as he has since the sublimity of <em>Rushmore,</em> their first project together. Reports from the Rome Film Festival, where Roman Coppola&#x2019;s feature <em>A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III</em> debuted in November, suggest he does the same alongside Charlie Sheen.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.11">And yet, for the past decade, the one area Murray has failed to find an assured place is in comedies that announce themselves as comedies. When I ask why, he&#x2019;s silent for a full fifteen seconds. &quot;They&#x2019;re different,&quot; he says finally. &quot;They&#x2019;re just different from what I used to do.&quot; He&#x2019;s right. On the surface&#x2014;and, one suspects, in the minds of their makers&#x2014;movies like <em>The Hangover</em> and <em>Knocked Up </em>are directly in the lineage of Murray&#x2019;s classics: <em>Meatballs, Stripes, Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day.</em> But if those earlier movies are about being a man and negotiating the world, the dominant theme of the newer ones is about avoiding it, staying a boy&#x2014;albeit a boy raised on the films of Bill Murray.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.12">Glazer says Murray is continually approached by comedy directors but has found few projects he feels are worth doing. &quot;I assume if he found them amusing, he&#x2019;d do them,&quot; he says. (One exception that Murray is particularly fond of was <em>Zombieland,</em> in which he played himself during the zombie apocalypse, the conceit being that he donned zombie drag in order to move about freely, a not-terrible metaphor for his relationship to the straight, non-Murray world now.)</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.13"> Still, comedy appears to be something the actor genuinely misses. &quot;The early movies, we just did them for fun. If they were funny, you did them. There wasn&#x2019;t this life-or-death thing,&quot; he says. &quot;I was in movies where I would turn up, and they&#x2019;d be like, &#x2019;Whaddya got?&#x2019; It was like, &#x2019;Turn on two cameras and let&#x2019;s go.&#x2019; &quot; In this light, it&#x2019;s hard not to see his recent mode of real-life exploits as the ercise of a disused muscle, a way to do off the screen what he no longer gets the chance to do on it.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.14">&quot;It&#x2019;s really a question I have. I think there&#x2019;s something that I can bring to a comedy today, but I don&#x2019;t know where to bring it,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#x2019;ve actually thought about having a manager again. Just to clear my head and have a plan.&quot; He pauses, as if working it out in his mind. &quot;Eh, it&#x2019;s not that attractive to have a plan. I know that if I ever feel that I need to make a funny movie, I&#x2019;ll figure out how to write one. I&#x2019;ll get it done. If I ever get some ambition, I&#x2019;m gonna get some shit done.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.15">He does a mock-offended eye roll/blink. &quot;What? It could happen.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.16"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.17">It could. And, maybe selfishly, I wish it would. Not because Murray&#x2019;s later performances, on- and offscreen, aren&#x2019;t full of delights, but because the notion of his passing into a genteel old age of masterful but dutiful roles in Oscar movies would&#x2014;not to make too much of it&#x2014;feel like something akin to the death of the universe.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.18">During the <em>Hyde Park</em> Q&amp;A, a tactful young cineast had risen to ask about a scene in which FDR goes for a swim, his crippled body suddenly graceful in water, the camera regarding his wasted legs as they float by. What kinds of special effects, the questioner wanted to know, were used to make those legs quite so unbelievably gnarled and horrible looking?</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.19">It was immediately clear, from the laughter among the others onstage, that the answer was none. Murray was silent for a long moment and then reached down for that fathomless gear of deadpan to which perhaps only he, since Buster Keaton, has access. &quot;That,&quot; he said finally, &quot;is <em>acting.</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.1a">Now he tells the story of his morning on Roosevelt Island&#x2014;except not about the kickball game. I will have to learn about that later, on the Internet. Instead, he talks about the original reason for the trip, where he went first: to see the recently completed FDR Four Freedoms memorial, located on the tip of the island (where, he mentions, an unfilmed scene in <em>Ghostbusters</em> was meant to be set). He had seen a documentary about the project on PBS and, having recently channeled the president, decided to take his sons and their friends for a look.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> &quot;It was designed by Louis Kahn, and it&#x2019;s got some moves,&quot; he says, flipping through photos on his phone and shaking his head, impressed. &quot;This is what they call The Room,&quot; he says, passing the phone. &quot;There&#x2019;s six-by-six-by-twelve-foot granite blocks with a tiny bit of space between them that&#x2019;s polished on the inside, so the light actually kicks through the whole thing. The Room is pretty boss.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.1c">The only problem was that the memorial was in the final stages of construction and not yet open, so they crept around the edges, looking for a way in. A perfect setup for a little of that Murray magic.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> &quot;I waved to the people driving in and out in their itty-bitty cars, and eventually I saw one of the guys walking back, saying, &#x2019;They said you were out here.&#x2019; &quot; Murray seems suddenly sheepish, as if hearing how it sounds: just another celebrity getting through doors on the strength of his face&#x2014;not with wit and charm and guile, not with <em>sand.</em></p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.1e">&quot;It wasn&#x2019;t like they were like, &#x2019;Hey, you&#x2019;re the guy from <em>What About Bob?</em>&#x2019; or anything. One guy didn&#x2019;t speak very much English, and they obviously weren&#x2019;t really movie buffs...,&quot; he says, rubbing those legs gingerly. A mere guard, he&#x2019;ll have you know, is still no match for the power of the Murricane. He&#x2019;d have made it through the gate.</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.1f">&quot;I had that,&quot; he says with perfect confidence. &quot;If I had a little more time, I could have gotten it done.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> <em> Brett Martin is a GQ correspondent.</em></p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".20867yip88w.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
