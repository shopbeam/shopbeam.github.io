  	    "articleBody": "Jeffrey Tambor is sitting in the window of a diner in the suburbs north of New York City, telling a story about losing his hair at the age of 16, when a young man approaches tentatively on the sidewalk outside and holds a handwritten note up to the glass: \u0022Would you mind if I came in and got your autograph?\u0022 Tambor reads the note aloud, squints behind a pair of owlish glasses, makes a face we\u0027ve all seen him make a million times—indignation flavored with the slightest pinch of mischief—and then bellows his answer: \u0022Yes!\u0022\u000A\u000AToo late: The guy is already bouncing through the door.\u000A\u000AWhen Tambor was a boy, growing up in San Francisco as \u0022the only Jew within miles,\u0022 he fell in love with the theater and used to practice giving autographs in his family\u0027s basement. \u0022I would daydream about what it would be like to be an actor. I would even do talk shows where I interviewed myself,\u0022 he tells me, shifting his lanky six-foot-two frame in the booth. \u0022Oh, Lord. They were so worried about me.\u0022 No wonder he can tell you exactly where he was the first time anyone ever asked him for his autograph: outside the Broadhurst Theatre on West 44th Street after his Broadway debut, when he was 33.\u000A\u000ANow, at 71, Tambor has had such a long and varied career that when people recognize him, it\u0027s impossible to guess which role they\u0027re thinking of. Lately it\u0027s been for Transparent, the hit Amazon show on which Tambor plays Mort/Maura Pfefferman, a professor and father of three adult kids who is transitioning into a woman. Transparent represents a long-overdue first for Tambor—a series built entirely around his character—and a crowning moment for one of the most respected dramedic actors in Hollywood. (The role won him a Golden Globe earlier this year and is widely predicted to garner his seventh Emmy nomination before this article comes out.) At the same time, it\u0027s the third in a trio of equally beloved characters—the others are Hank \u0022Hey Now!\u0022 Kingsley, from The Larry Sanders Show, and George Bluth Sr., the incarcerated patriarch on Arrested Development—that Tambor calls \u0022the hooks\u0022 on which his career hangs. And what a career. His résumé includes more than fifty feature films and dozens of TV shows across every conceivable genre, from Hill Street Blues and MASH to L.A. Law and The Twilight Zone.* In the \u002780s, he even appeared in a Phil Collins music video (\u0022I Wish It Would Rain Down\u0022).\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ATransparent has been \u0022a thrill ride—all I\u0027ve ever wanted as an actor,\u0022 Tambor says, taking a bite of his egg-white sandwich. Too often on TV, comedic roles are one-note: greedy, angry, dumb. Maura, by contrast, is a symphony, contradictory and complex. In one of Tambor\u0027s favorite early scenes, Mort and his kids devour barbecue out of Styrofoam boxes, food flying everywhere. After a debate about whether you should wipe your chin clean as you eat or \u0022hose off\u0022 afterward, Mort tries for the first time to broach the subject of the \u0022big change going on\u0022 within him. But he can\u0027t do it, hiding his sauce-stained face in his hands. In more than one way, Tambor tells me, the scene highlights the messiness—and unconscious repetition—of familial relationships: \u0022I like that [eating take-out barbecue] is a family ritual, and they do it over and over, no matter what\u0027s going on.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis is the essential thing about Tambor\u0027s brand of comedy: It hinges on his characters\u0027 obliviousness to how funny they are. Jill Soloway, who was inspired to create Transparent by her own trans parent, describes Tambor as the \u0022perfect mixture of funny and sad.\u0022 When approaching a scene, he never sets out to be comic or tragic. He aims to be real, and in real life, people often don\u0027t realize their own ridiculousness.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestMartin Schoeller\u000A\u000A\u0022He\u0027s just so convincingly, hilariously serious about these absurd things that he says and these absurd characters he plays,\u0022 says Jason Bateman, who co-starred on Arrested Development and is one of many, many people who consider Tambor a mentor. \u0022There\u0027s a very healthy indifference with what he does. He\u0027s not begging for laughs.\u0022 Even in a sitcom, Bateman continues, \u0022whatever character he\u0027s playing is in the most serious drama you could ever hope to film, you know? It is not a comedy to him.\u0022\u000A\u000ANow, at the diner, the autograph seeker, looking vaguely nautical in a red windbreaker, is tableside and grinning. Tambor suggests a selfie, but the guy insists on also getting a signature for \u0022a friend who\u0027s a huge fan of The Larry Sanders Show.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022So what\u0027s your friend\u0027s name?\u0022 Tambor asks, starting to scribble. \u0022It\u0027s Andrew,\u0022 the guy says, then implores: \u0022Maybe say, ‘Hey, now!\u0027?\u0022 At the mention of Hank\u0027s signature line, Tambor looks up, scowling in an exaggerated, mean-muggy way. He obliges, then sends the guy on his way with this: \u0022Now are you going to ask me for money?\u0022\u000A\u000AI laugh. The guy laughs. Jeffrey Tambor does not.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe Role of a Lifetime, Part I: The Larry Sanders ShowIt\u0027s possible that you\u0027re too young to remember this HBO series from the \u002790s, but you\u0027ve definitely watched a lot of shows that owe it a massive debt. Larry Sanders starred co-creator Garry Shandling as a narcissistic talk-show host and Tambor as his unctuous sidekick, Hank. The groundbreaking series, shot in a faux-documentary style, satirized not just late-night TV but our entire celebrity-obsessed and voyeuristic culture, paving the way for the likes of The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and 30 Rock. Tambor has said the role transformed his career. He also likes to say that Hank was a professional at work but an amateur at life. Though you never saw Hank\u0027s home on the show, Tambor says he imagined it as empty: no art on the walls, no books on the shelves. Hank lived for Larry Sanders.\u000A\u000ADuring casting, Shandling searched for months for the perfect Hank. Several actors read for the part, and a few even captured Hank\u0027s sycophantic core. But Shandling felt Larry\u0027s sidekick needed emotional range. More than a buffoon, he could be loyal, loving, and even wise. That\u0027s when a producer friend, Alan Zweibel, sent over Tambor\u0027s eight-by-ten.\u000A\u000AShandling wasn\u0027t familiar with Tambor\u0027s work, so he sought the opinion of his protégé, Judd Apatow, who was already known as a kind of comedy savant. Apatow emphatically endorsed Tambor, urging Shandling to check out his performance in …And Justice for All. In the 1979 film, Tambor\u0027s feature debut, he plays the partner of an embattled defense attorney (Al Pacino, who got an Oscar nomination for the lead role). In certain comedy circles, though, it\u0027s Tambor\u0027s performance that borders on legend—which is especially legendary given that …And Justice for All, which revolves around the trial of a rapist, is a drama. But about ten minutes in, there\u0027s a scene in a courthouse restroom where Tambor takes his big line—\u0022You don\u0027t threaten a judge\u0022—and dials it way the hell up by repeating it at scream volume—\u0022YOU DON\u0027T THREATEN A JUDGE!\u0022—when Pacino turns his back on him. It\u0027s a made-for-Tambor moment, a line that wasn\u0027t even supposed to be funny but somehow transforms into serio-absurdist comedy when he delivers it.\u000A\u000AShandling watched the movie, then asked Tambor to come in and read. They did a scene in which Hank tells Larry, \u0022You worry about your half of the show, I\u0027ll worry about mine,\u0022 and an angry Larry storms out of the room. But when Shandling got up and headed for the door, Tambor moved a couch to block his way. \u0022It struck me like a lightning bolt,\u0022 Shandling told me. Still, Shandling was undecided until Tambor called him later.\u000A\u000A\u0022He was very genuine,\u0022 Shandling says. \u0022He said, ‘I\u0027ve been thinking about this—I know this guy. I know this guy.\u0027 \u0022 Tambor remembers the call, too. \u0022I told him, ‘Garry, I really want that role\u0027—because that\u0027s something I teach: If you want something, you have to ask for it.\u0022 (Tambor has taught acting off and on for decades.) \u0022So I did. I said, ‘I am Hank.\u0027 And then I said, ‘I have never made a call like this.\u0027 And Garry said, ‘No, but Hank has.\u0027 Isn\u0027t that good?\u0022\u000A\u000AWe\u0027ve left the diner and climbed into Tambor\u0027s brand-new Toyota Sequoia, a huge vehicle he loves, he says, because it reminds him of his childhood. Tambor\u0027s dad, a professional boxer turned flooring contractor, owned a big truck sort of like this one, and the two of them would ride around in it, delivering rugs. Barney Tambor was Jeffrey\u0027s hero—a gentle giant of a man whose attitude toward success was \u0022Don\u0027t celebrate too much. Because they might take it away.\u0022 As we drive through the lush, rolling landscape of Westchester County on our way to the five-bedroom brick home Tambor shares with his third wife, Kasia, and their four children, all under the age of 11, he admits that admonition—Don\u0027t celebrate!—was something he has worked hard to overcome. Once, he says, when his mother visited the set of Sanders, Shandling told her, \u0022You must be very proud of your son.\u0022 Her response: \u0022I would be more proud if he had his own show.\u0022\u000A\u000ASanders, he says, taught him essential lessons about his craft. \u0022Garry took me to school. He liked mistakes. I remember him saying, ‘Look, you can\u0027t button this down. You\u0027ve got to let it happen to you.\u0027 \u0022 In its best moments, he says, doing the show felt \u0022like free fall.\u0022\u000A\u000ASuddenly he has a request. \u0022Please don\u0027t let me forget as we\u0027re talking that my dog is being groomed and not to leave him over the weekend,\u0022 he implores, explaining that Gus, the family\u0027s Bouvier des Flandres—\u0022like a Buick with hair, he\u0027s so big\u0022—is getting his \u0022summer cut.\u0022\u000A\u000AObediently I write \u0022DOG\u0022 on a scrap of paper and tuck it into the cup holder. Tambor smiles with that mouth that so often seems settled into a frown: \u0022I love the idea of you typing up your notes later and going, ‘Oh, right, the dog!\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Role of a Lifetime, Part II:  Arrested DevelopmentUntil Tambor brought George Bluth Sr. to life, the crooked, overbearing character was imagined as a one-off, to appear in the pilot only. Instead, his performance—as the disgraced founder of a company that builds mini-mansions—was such a bombastic delight that executives at Fox, the network producing the show back in 2003, insisted he be in every episode.\u000A\u000AArrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz, who had written George with Tambor in mind, was happy to comply. From the get-go, he says, Tambor had upped the quality of the production by inspiring everyone around him. For example, in the pilot, Bluth Sr. is arrested on a boat in the midst of his floating retirement party. While shooting that scene, Hurwitz suggested at the last minute that George get on the phone with his secretary just before he is apprehended and tell her to dump incriminating documents.\u000A\u000A\u0022He did two brilliant things,\u0022 Hurwitz recalls. \u0022First, as he said, ‘Shred it. Shred it. Save it. Shred it,\u0027 into the phone, he seemed to hear her on the other end. Like you could just tell she was going through a litany of things\u0022—when, of course, Tambor was talking to dead air, conjuring a character that hadn\u0027t existed ten seconds before. \u0022Second, after he says all this—‘Shred, save, shred, shred\u0027—he pauses and says to the secretary, ‘Why are you crying?\u0027 It was the most inspired ad-lib. He just invented that this character we\u0027ve never met would be crying. I can\u0027t even explain the serious mind behind that.\u0022\u000A\u000ABateman, who was the show\u0027s moral center and straight man, says he had trouble not bursting into hysterics in the scenes he and Tambor shared. After blowing more than one take, he resolved to find \u0022some kind of strategy to keep from laughing. What I came up with was: Just don\u0027t look him in the eyes. So I would look just below his eyeballs, or just above his eyeballs, or at the tip of his nose, or at his temples. I was going cross-eyed. And after a while, he discovered it, and he\u0027d break the take and complain to me that it was like working with Helen Keller.\u0022\u000A\u000ANot only did Tambor play George, he also played his pot-smoking, freeloading twin brother, Oscar. When I ask Tambor what it was like to play the twins, he brightens as if thinking of old friends. \u0022I loved George,\u0022 he says, \u0022but Oscar—Oscar was the one I went, ‘Oh, I love Oscar.\u0027 Oscar has a little Hank in him.\u0022 We are in his study now, a sunny room at the front of his house. Sitting under a framed poster for the 1925 silent film Ben-Hur (a gift from playwright David Mamet), he asks if he can put his feet up on his desk, then does so elegantly, in one long-limbed swoop.\u000A\u000ATambor says the secret to Hank\u0027s and Oscar\u0027s power was \u0022just past the laugh.\u0022 This is the sweet spot he strives to occupy as an actor—the place where comedy becomes not just about levity but about revealing a character\u0027s humanity. \u0022Lying and art are very allied,\u0022 he says. \u0022But after you lie, you get to the truth.\u0022\u000A\u000AHere\u0027s something I want the truth about: Is there going to be a fifth season of Arrested Development? When I ask Tambor and Bateman, both demur, claiming ignorance. Hurwitz says that while he\u0027s loath to \u0022abuse the fans\u0027 interest in it,\u0022 he can confirm that he is actively working \u0022every day\u0022 to make a fifth season happen (and that if that doesn\u0027t work out, he\u0027ll turn his attention to a film). Netflix is on board, as is Fox (which owns the show), Hurwitz says, \u0022and my hope is to start the writers\u0027 room on it this summer, while they\u0027re making deals with the cast.\u0022\u000A\u000AIf that should come to pass, I ask Tambor, would it be difficult to play Maura Pfefferman at the same time he is breathing new life into George Bluth Sr.? \u0022No,\u0022 he says flatly, reminding me he spent about twelve years doing repertory theater in towns like Louisville, Milwaukee, and Seattle. \u0022You had a different role every night. Can you imagine that?\u0022\u000A\u000AThose days came to an end in 1976, when he was offered a job as Hector Elizondo\u0027s understudy in the Broadway production of Sly Fox, opposite George C. Scott. People advised him not to take it: He\u0027d fathered his first child, Molly (she\u0027s 41 now), and this gig could mean he\u0027d be an understudy the rest of his life. But after eighteen months, he got his chance to go toe-to-toe with Scott, a lion of the theater. He \u0022fumfered\u0022 (muffed) his first line, he recalls, but then gained confidence and nailed the rest. At the curtain call, Scott hushed the audience and made a point to single out Tambor\u0027s performance. \u0022He told the crowd, ‘This is his first time. You\u0027re going to hear something from this guy.\u0027 I went to Sardi\u0027s afterward and had the famous cannelloni. Then I don\u0027t think I slept for two days.\u0022\u000A\u000AThings changed quickly after that. His first TV guest spot was on Kojak, then Starsky &amp; Hutch. In 1979, he got a co-starring role in The Ropers, a short-lived spin-off of Three\u0027s Company. Things were good. Except they also weren\u0027t: Around this time, Tambor lost the brother he adored to alcoholism—a tragedy his family never acknowledged publicly (saying he died of pneumonia) for years.\u000A\u000AFor a while, he says, \u0022I lost my moorings. But you know the great thing about acting? It\u0027s all part of the gig. You get to put it in your work.\u0022 Alcoholism, with which Tambor himself would later struggle (he\u0027s been sober for fifteen years), \u0022was our family secret,\u0022 which is part of why Transparent resonates so deeply with him. \u0022The Pfeffermans have their secret,\u0022 he says. \u0022That\u0027s something I relate to.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe Role of a Lifetime, Part III: Transparent The highest praise Tambor can give a performance is to say, \u0022It doesn\u0027t look acted. It looks found.\u0022 When he watched Jill Soloway\u0027s first feature film, an indie called Afternoon Delight, that\u0027s how he felt. Similarly, when he read her script for the Transparent pilot, he responded immediately. \u0022It had that snap,\u0022 he says, snapping his fingers. \u0022That verve. I said, ‘I\u0027m in. I\u0027m in. I\u0027m in.\u0027 I all but threw myself at Jill.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe has said that he was \u0022throw-up nervous\u0022 about depicting Maura, whose look—all muumuus and scarves and oversize sunglasses—Soloway likens to a \u0022Jewish therapist on vacation in Sag Harbor.\u0022 But it wasn\u0027t dressing in drag that scared Tambor, he clarifies: \u0022I was worried about doing it right, whatever that means. Because it\u0027s important.\u0022\u000A\u000AIndeed, of Tambor\u0027s three best-known roles—all set in California, all revolving around dysfunctional families of one kind or another—this is indisputably the one that is about something that matters. Shortly before shooting the first season, as a sort of trial run, Tambor took Maura out to The Oxwood Inn, a club that hosts a weekly trans night. He remembers his knees trembling as he first stepped into public and, then, \u0022my realization: Nobody\u0027s looking at you. Once I threw myself into it, there was something very easy about it.\u0022\u000A\u000AJudith Light, who plays Mort\u0027s ex-wife, Shelly, on the show, was at The Oxwood Inn for Maura\u0027s unveiling. She and Tambor have been close since 1971, when they did theater together in Milwaukee, and she says collaborating again has been a joy. It shows. In one indelible scene from season one, Maura comes over to help Shelly with her ailing second husband, and Shelly lectures their kids about how Mort remains her soul mate. \u0022I say, ‘He\u0027s the only one who comes over for me.\u0027 And Maura says, ‘She,\u0027 \u0022 Light recalls, mimicking Tambor\u0027s soft intonation perfectly. \u0022And I say, ‘He\u0027s the only one that is really here for me. None of you kids ever come over.\u0027 And she says, ‘She.\u0027 And then, the third time I say, ‘He\u0027s the great one, and you guys are terrible.\u0027 She says, ‘She.\u0027 And I say, ‘She.\u0027 There is a progression of letting in who this person is. We eat from each other\u0027s plates and we take from each other\u0027s mouths and we\u0027re a family, and you feel it, and it moves you.\u0022\u000A\u000AAmazon began streaming Transparent sixteen months before Caitlyn Jenner introduced herself to the world, and in that way, seeing Tambor in a caftan feels finger-on-the-pulse prescient. (Soloway says that Jenner has been invited to visit the set as the cast works through season two, which is expected to begin streaming this winter.) Tambor has said he\u0027s inspired by Jenner, but he is also proud that Maura is not striving for perfection. \u0022I just love that she\u0027s of an age and that gravity has started to exert its force,\u0022 he says. Hurwitz recalls Tambor once telling him: \u0022Character is inconsistency.\u0022 To Tambor, Maura\u0027s flaws are her beauty.\u000A\u000AAfter several months off from the show, he tells me, he misses her. More than once as we talk, he catches himself using Maura\u0027s mannerisms—holding a hand around his throat, as if to prop up his jaw, or using both thumbs and pointer fingers to grasp the fabric of his shirt right above the breastbone. He admits a few of these gestures remind him of his late mom, a housewife he compares to Auntie Mame. \u0022There\u0027s a lot I don\u0027t know about Maura until Maura does it,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000ASoloway, who calls Tambor \u0022Moppa\u0022—a melding of \u0022Mom\u0022 and \u0022Poppa\u0022 that is his nickname on the show—says season two has great things in store for Maura. \u0022Because the central conceit of the show was that the trans person is the most normal person in this family, and because in season one we were sort of introducing America to the idea of trans-ness, we didn\u0027t give Maura as many unlikable moments as we could have,\u0022 Soloway says. Thanks in part to Jenner, \u0022America is kind of caught up now. So we can allow Maura to be more vulnerable, to not be a saint, to fall in love, screw up, make enemies.\u0022\u000A\u000AI tell all this to Tambor as he prepares to deliver me back to the Katonah train station, and he looks pleased. \u0022Remember Willy Loman? I\u0027m liked but not well-liked,\u0022 he recites, paraphrasing Death of a Salesman. His 10-year-old son, Gabriel, has joined us, as there\u0027s a Cub Scout meeting they need to get to. Gabe is talking about a biography of Albert Einstein he\u0027s reading, and Tambor sounds like very much the proud father. \u0022Isn\u0027t he great?\u0022 he says. \u0022I could weep.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe putters around the kitchen, and at one point asks me sweetly, \u0022Shall I make you a sandwich?\u0022 When I decline, we pile back into the massive four-by-four. \u0022Are we all buckled? Is everybody buckled?\u0022 Tambor booms, Moppa-like. Then, to Gabe, after a glance at the cup holder: \u0022Let\u0027s go get our dog!\u0022\u000A\u000A",

I would even do talk shows where I interviewed myself,&quot; he tells me, shifting his lanky six-foot-two frame in the booth. &quot;Oh, Lord. They were so worried about me.&quot; No wonder he can tell you exactly where he was the first time anyone ever asked him for his autograph: outside the Broadhurst Theatre on West 44th Street after his Broadway debut, when he was 33.</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.3">Now, at 71, Tambor has had such a long and varied career that when people recognize him, it&apos;s impossible to guess which role they&apos;re thinking of. Lately it&apos;s been for <em>Transparent,</em> the hit Amazon show on which Tambor plays Mort/Maura Pfefferman, a professor and father of three adult kids who is transitioning into a woman. <em>Transparent</em> represents a long-overdue first for Tambor&#x2014;a series built entirely around his character&#x2014;and a crowning moment for one of the most respected dramedic actors in Hollywood. (The role won him a Golden Globe earlier this year and is widely predicted to garner his seventh Emmy nomination before this article comes out.) At the same time, it&apos;s the third in a trio of equally beloved characters&#x2014;the others are Hank &quot;Hey Now!&quot; Kingsley, from <em>The Larry Sanders Show,</em> and George Bluth Sr., the incarcerated patriarch on <em>Arrested Development&#x2014;</em>that Tambor calls &quot;the hooks&quot; on which his career hangs. And what a career. His r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; includes more than fifty feature films and dozens of TV shows across every conceivable genre, from <em>Hill Street Blues</em> and <em>M</em>A<em>S</em>H<em> to </em>L.A. Law<em> and </em>The Twilight Zone.* In the &apos;80s, he even appeared in a Phil Collins music video (&quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot;).</p><div class="embed cnevideo" data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.5"><figure class="embedded-video" data-src="//player.cnevids.com/embedjs/55ae964361646d2f86000015/51097beb8ef9aff9f5000005.js" data-type="cnevideo"><script src="http://player.cnevids.com/embedjs/55ae964361646d2f86000015/51097beb8ef9aff9f5000005.js"></script></figure></div><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.6"><em>Transparent</em> has been &quot;a thrill ride&#x2014;all I&apos;ve ever wanted as an actor,&quot; Tambor says, taking a bite of his egg-white sandwich. Too often on TV, comedic roles are one-note: greedy, angry, dumb. Maura, by contrast, is a symphony, contradictory and complex. In one of Tambor&apos;s favorite early scenes, Mort and his kids devour barbecue out of Styrofoam boxes, food flying everywhere. After a debate about whether you should wipe your chin clean as you eat or &quot;hose off&quot; afterward, Mort tries for the first time to broach the subject of the &quot;big change going on&quot; within him. But he can&apos;t do it, hiding his sauce-stained face in his hands. In more than one way, Tambor tells me, the scene highlights the messiness&#x2014;and unconscious repetition&#x2014;of familial relationships: &quot;I like that [eating take-out barbecue] is a family ritual, and they do it over and over, no matter what&apos;s going on.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.7">This is the essential thing about Tambor&apos;s brand of comedy: It hinges on his characters&apos; obliviousness to how funny they are. Jill Soloway, who was inspired to create <em>Transparent</em> by her own trans parent, describes Tambor as the &quot;perfect mixture of funny and sad.&quot; When approaching a scene, he never sets out to be comic or tragic. He aims to be real, and in real life, people often don&apos;t realize their own ridiculousness.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.8"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a6990fdab0df6312e29079/master/w_768/jeffery-tambor-gq-02.jpg" alt="jeffery-tambor-gq-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftransparent-jeffrey-tambor-comedian&amp;t=jeffery-tambor-gq-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftransparent-jeffrey-tambor-comedian&amp;t=jeffery-tambor-gq-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftransparent-jeffrey-tambor-comedian&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a6990fdab0df6312e29079%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fjeffery-tambor-gq-02.jpg&amp;description=jeffery-tambor-gq-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftransparent-jeffrey-tambor-comedian&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a6990fdab0df6312e29079%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fjeffery-tambor-gq-02.jpg&amp;description=jeffery-tambor-gq-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Martin Schoeller</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.9">&quot;He&apos;s just so convincingly, hilariously serious about these absurd things that he says and these absurd characters he plays,&quot; says Jason Bateman, who co-starred on <em>Arrested Development</em> and is one of many, many people who consider Tambor a mentor. &quot;There&apos;s a very healthy indifference with what he does. He&apos;s not begging for laughs.&quot; Even in a sitcom, Bateman continues, &quot;whatever character he&apos;s playing is in the most serious drama you could ever hope to film, you know?

He obliges, then sends the guy on his way with this: &quot;Now are you going to ask me for money?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.c">I laugh. The guy laughs.

The groundbreaking series, shot in a faux-documentary style, satirized not just late-night TV but our entire celebrity-obsessed and voyeuristic culture, paving the way for the likes of <em>The Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm,</em> and <em>30 Rock.</em> Tambor has said the role transformed his career. He also likes to say that Hank was a professional at work but an amateur at life. Though you never saw Hank&apos;s home on the show, Tambor says he imagined it as empty: no art on the walls, no books on the shelves. Hank <em>lived</em> for Larry Sanders.</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.f">During casting, Shandling searched for months for the perfect Hank. Several actors read for the part, and a few even captured Hank&apos;s sycophantic core. But Shandling felt Larry&apos;s sidekick needed emotional range. More than a buffoon, he could be loyal, loving, and even wise. That&apos;s when a producer friend, Alan Zweibel, sent over Tambor&apos;s eight-by-ten.</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.g">Shandling wasn&apos;t familiar with Tambor&apos;s work, so he sought the opinion of his prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;, Judd Apatow, who was already known as a kind of comedy savant. Apatow emphatically endorsed Tambor, urging Shandling to check out his performance in &#x2026;<em>And Justice for All.</em> In the 1979 film, Tambor&apos;s feature debut, he plays the partner of an embattled defense attorney (Al Pacino, who got an Oscar nomination for the lead role). In certain comedy circles, though, it&apos;s Tambor&apos;s performance that borders on legend&#x2014;which is especially legendary given that <em>&#x2026;And Justice for All,</em> which revolves around the trial of a rapist, is a drama. But about ten minutes in, there&apos;s a scene in a courthouse restroom where Tambor takes his big line&#x2014;&quot;You don&apos;t threaten a judge&quot;&#x2014;and dials it way the hell up by repeating it at scream volume&#x2014;&quot;<em>YOU DON&apos;T THREATEN A JUDGE!&quot;&#x2014;</em>when Pacino turns his back on him. It&apos;s a made-for-Tambor moment, a line that wasn&apos;t even supposed to be funny but somehow transforms into serio-absurdist comedy when he delivers it.</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.h">Shandling watched the movie, then asked Tambor to come in and read. They did a scene in which Hank tells Larry, &quot;You worry about your half of the show, I&apos;ll worry about mine,&quot; and an angry Larry storms out of the room. But when Shandling got up and headed for the door, Tambor moved a couch to block his way. &quot;It struck me like a lightning bolt,&quot; Shandling told me. Still, Shandling was undecided until Tambor called him later.</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;He was very genuine,&quot; Shandling says. &quot;He said, &#x2018;I&apos;ve been thinking about this&#x2014;I know this guy. I <em>know</em> this guy.&#x2019; &quot; Tambor remembers the call, too. &quot;I told him, &#x2018;Garry, I really want that role&#x2019;&#x2014;because that&apos;s something I teach: If you want something, you have to ask for it.&quot; (Tambor has taught acting off and on for decades.) &quot;So I did. I said, &#x2018;I <em>am</em> Hank.&#x2019; And then I said, &#x2018;I have never made a call like this.&#x2019; And Garry said, &#x2018;No, but Hank has.&#x2019; Isn&apos;t that good?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.j">We&apos;ve left the diner and climbed into Tambor&apos;s brand-new Toyota Sequoia, a huge vehicle he loves, he says, because it reminds him of his childhood. Tambor&apos;s dad, a professional boxer turned flooring contractor, owned a big truck sort of like this one, and the two of them would ride around in it, delivering rugs. Barney Tambor was Jeffrey&apos;s hero&#x2014;a gentle giant of a man whose attitude toward success was &quot;Don&apos;t celebrate too much. Because they might take it away.&quot; As we drive through the lush, rolling landscape of Westchester County on our way to the five-bedroom brick home Tambor shares with his third wife, Kasia, and their four children, all under the age of 11, he admits that admonition&#x2014;<em>Don&apos;t celebrate!</em>&#x2014;was something he has worked hard to overcome. Once, he says, when his mother visited the set of <em>Sanders,</em> Shandling told her, &quot;You must be very proud of your son.&quot; Her response: &quot;I would be more proud if he had his <em>own</em> show.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.k"><em>Sanders,</em> he says, taught him essential lessons about his craft. &quot;Garry took me to school. He liked mistakes. I remember him saying, &#x2018;Look, you can&apos;t button this down. You&apos;ve got to let it happen to you.&#x2019; &quot; In its best moments, he says, doing the show felt &quot;like free fall.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.l">Suddenly he has a request. &quot;Please don&apos;t let me forget as we&apos;re talking that my dog is being groomed and not to leave him over the weekend,&quot; he implores, explaining that Gus, the family&apos;s Bouvier des Flandres&#x2014;&quot;like a Buick with hair, he&apos;s so big&quot;&#x2014;is getting his &quot;summer cut.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.m">Obediently I write &quot;DOG&quot; on a scrap of paper and tuck it into the cup holder. Tambor smiles with that mouth that so often seems settled into a frown: &quot;I love the idea of you typing up your notes later and going, &#x2018;Oh, right, the dog!&#x2019; &quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.n"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>The Role of a Lifetime, Part II: </strong> <strong><em>Arrested Development</em></strong><br>Until Tambor brought George Bluth Sr. to life, the crooked, overbearing character was imagined as a one-off, to appear in the pilot only. Instead, his performance&#x2014;as the disgraced founder of a company that builds mini-mansions&#x2014;was such a bombastic delight that executives at Fox, the network producing the show back in 2003, insisted he be in every episode.</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.p"><em>Arrested Development</em> creator Mitch Hurwitz, who had written George with Tambor in mind, was happy to comply. From the get-go, he says, Tambor had upped the quality of the production by inspiring everyone around him. For example, in the pilot, Bluth Sr. is arrested on a boat in the midst of his floating retirement party. While shooting that scene, Hurwitz suggested at the last minute that George get on the phone with his secretary just before he is apprehended and tell her to dump incriminating documents.</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.q">&quot;He did two brilliant things,&quot; Hurwitz recalls. &quot;First, as he said, &#x2018;Shred it. Shred it. Save it. Shred it,&#x2019; into the phone, he seemed to hear her on the other end. Like you could just tell she was going through a litany of things&quot;&#x2014;when, of course, Tambor was talking to dead air, conjuring a character that hadn&apos;t existed ten seconds before. &quot;Second, after he says all this&#x2014;&#x2018;Shred, save, shred, shred&#x2019;&#x2014;he pauses and says to the secretary, &#x2018;Why are <em>you</em> crying?&#x2019; It was the most inspired ad-lib. He just invented that this character we&apos;ve never met would be crying. I can&apos;t even explain the serious mind behind that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.r">Bateman, who was the show&apos;s moral center and straight man, says he had trouble not bursting into hysterics in the scenes he and Tambor shared. After blowing more than one take, he resolved to find &quot;some kind of strategy to keep from laughing. What I came up with was: Just don&apos;t look him in the eyes. So I would look just below his eyeballs, or just above his eyeballs, or at the tip of his nose, or at his temples. I was going cross-eyed. And after a while, he discovered it, and he&apos;d break the take and complain to me that it was like working with Helen Keller.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.s">Not only did Tambor play George, he also played his pot-smoking, freeloading twin brother, Oscar. When I ask Tambor what it was like to play the twins, he brightens as if thinking of old friends. &quot;I loved George,&quot; he says, &quot;but Oscar&#x2014;Oscar was the one I went, &#x2018;Oh, I <em>love</em> Oscar.&#x2019; Oscar has a little Hank in him.&quot; We are in his study now, a sunny room at the front of his house. Sitting under a framed poster for the 1925 silent film <em>Ben-Hur</em> (a gift from playwright David Mamet), he asks if he can put his feet up on his desk, then does so elegantly, in one long-limbed swoop.</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.t">Tambor says the secret to Hank&apos;s and Oscar&apos;s power was &quot;just past the laugh.&quot; This is the sweet spot he strives to occupy as an actor&#x2014;the place where comedy becomes not just about levity but about revealing a character&apos;s humanity. &quot;Lying and art are very allied,&quot; he says. &quot;But after you lie, you get to the truth.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.u">Here&apos;s something I want the truth about: Is there going to be a fifth season of <em>Arrested Development</em>? When I ask Tambor and Bateman, both demur, claiming ignorance. Hurwitz says that while he&apos;s loath to &quot;abuse the fans&apos; interest in it,&quot; he can confirm that he is actively working &quot;every day&quot; to make a fifth season happen (and that if that doesn&apos;t work out, he&apos;ll turn his attention to a film). Netflix is on board, as is Fox (which owns the show), Hurwitz says, &quot;and my hope is to start the writers&apos; room on it this summer, while they&apos;re making deals with the cast.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.v">If that should come to pass, I ask Tambor, would it be difficult to play Maura Pfefferman at the same time he is breathing new life into George Bluth Sr.? &quot;No,&quot; he says flatly, reminding me he spent about twelve years doing repertory theater in towns like Louisville, Milwaukee, and Seattle. &quot;You had a different role every night. Can you imagine that?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.w">Those days came to an end in 1976, when he was offered a job as Hector Elizondo&apos;s understudy in the Broadway production of <em>Sly Fox,</em> opposite George C. Scott. People advised him not to take it: He&apos;d fathered his first child, Molly (she&apos;s 41 now), and this gig could mean he&apos;d be an understudy the rest of his life. But after eighteen months, he got his chance to go toe-to-toe with Scott, a lion of the theater. He <em>&quot;fumfered&quot;</em> (muffed) his first line, he recalls, but then gained confidence and nailed the rest. At the curtain call, Scott hushed the audience and made a point to single out Tambor&apos;s performance. &quot;He told the crowd, &#x2018;This is his first time. You&apos;re going to hear something from this guy.&#x2019; I went to Sardi&apos;s afterward and had the famous cannelloni. Then I don&apos;t think I slept for two days.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.x">Things changed quickly after that. His first TV guest spot was on <em>Kojak,</em> then <em>Starsky &amp; Hutch</em>. In 1979, he got a co-starring role in <em>The Ropers,</em> a short-lived spin-off of <em>Three&apos;s Company.</em> Things were good. Except they also weren&apos;t: Around this time, Tambor lost the brother he adored to alcoholism&#x2014;a tragedy his family never acknowledged publicly (saying he died of pneumonia) for years.</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.y">For a while, he says, &quot;I lost my moorings. But you know the great thing about acting? It&apos;s all part of the gig. You get to put it in your work.&quot; Alcoholism, with which Tambor himself would later struggle (he&apos;s been sober for fifteen years), &quot;was our family secret,&quot; which is part of why <em>Transparent</em> resonates so deeply with him. &quot;The Pfeffermans have their secret,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s something I relate to.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.z"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.10"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a69910dab0df6312e29081/master/w_768/jeffery-tambor-gq-04.jpg" alt="jeffery-tambor-gq-04.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftransparent-jeffrey-tambor-comedian&amp;t=jeffery-tambor-gq-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftransparent-jeffrey-tambor-comedian&amp;t=jeffery-tambor-gq-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftransparent-jeffrey-tambor-comedian&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a69910dab0df6312e29081%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fjeffery-tambor-gq-04.jpg&amp;description=jeffery-tambor-gq-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftransparent-jeffrey-tambor-comedian&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a69910dab0df6312e29081%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fjeffery-tambor-gq-04.jpg&amp;description=jeffery-tambor-gq-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong>The Role of a Lifetime, Part III:</strong> <strong><em>Transparent</em></strong> <br>The highest praise Tambor can give a performance is to say, &quot;It doesn&apos;t look acted. It looks found.&quot; When he watched Jill Soloway&apos;s first feature film, an indie called <em>Afternoon Delight,</em> that&apos;s how he felt. Similarly, when he read her script for the <em>Transparent</em> pilot, he responded immediately. &quot;It had that snap,&quot; he says, snapping his fingers. &quot;That verve. I said, &#x2018;I&apos;m in. I&apos;m in. I&apos;m in.&#x2019; I all but threw myself at Jill.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.12">He has said that he was &quot;throw-up nervous&quot; about depicting Maura, whose look&#x2014;all muumuus and scarves and oversize sunglasses&#x2014;Soloway likens to a &quot;Jewish therapist on vacation in Sag Harbor.&quot; But it wasn&apos;t dressing in drag that scared Tambor, he clarifies: &quot;I was worried about doing it right, whatever that means. Because it&apos;s important.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.13">Indeed, of Tambor&apos;s three best-known roles&#x2014;all set in California, all revolving around dysfunctional families of one kind or another&#x2014;this is indisputably the one that is about something that matters. Shortly before shooting the first season, as a sort of trial run, Tambor took Maura out to The Oxwood Inn, a club that hosts a weekly trans night. He remembers his knees trembling as he first stepped into public and, then, &quot;my realization: Nobody&apos;s looking at you. Once I threw myself into it, there was something very easy about it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.14">Judith Light, who plays Mort&apos;s ex-wife, Shelly, on the show, was at The Oxwood Inn for Maura&apos;s unveiling. She and Tambor have been close since 1971, when they did theater together in Milwaukee, and she says collaborating again has been a joy. It shows. In one indelible scene from season one, Maura comes over to help Shelly with her ailing second husband, and Shelly lectures their kids about how Mort remains her soul mate. &quot;I say, &#x2018;He&apos;s the only one who comes over for me.&#x2019; And Maura says, <em>&#x2018;She,&#x2019;</em> &quot; Light recalls, mimicking Tambor&apos;s soft intonation perfectly. &quot;And I say, &#x2018;He&apos;s the only one that is really here for me. None of you kids ever come over.&#x2019; And she says, <em>&#x2018;She.&#x2019;</em> And then, the third time I say, &#x2018;He&apos;s the great one, and you guys are terrible.&#x2019; She says, <em>&#x2018;She.&#x2019;</em> And I say, <em>&#x2018;She.&#x2019;</em> There is a progression of letting in who this person is. We eat from each other&apos;s plates and we take from each other&apos;s mouths and we&apos;re a family, and you feel it, and it moves you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.15">Amazon began streaming <em>Transparent</em> sixteen months before Caitlyn Jenner introduced herself to the world, and in that way, seeing Tambor in a caftan feels finger-on-the-pulse prescient. (Soloway says that Jenner has been invited to visit the set as the cast works through season two, which is expected to begin streaming this winter.) Tambor has said he&apos;s inspired by Jenner, but he is also proud that Maura is not striving for perfection. &quot;I just love that she&apos;s of an age and that gravity has started to exert its force,&quot; he says. Hurwitz recalls Tambor once telling him: &quot;Character is inconsistency.&quot; To Tambor, Maura&apos;s flaws are her beauty.</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.16">After several months off from the show, he tells me, he misses her. More than once as we talk, he catches himself using Maura&apos;s mannerisms&#x2014;holding a hand around his throat, as if to prop up his jaw, or using both thumbs and pointer fingers to grasp the fabric of his shirt right above the breastbone. He admits a few of these gestures remind him of his late mom, a housewife he compares to Auntie Mame. &quot;There&apos;s a lot I don&apos;t know about Maura until Maura does it,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.17">Soloway, who calls Tambor &quot;Moppa&quot;&#x2014;a melding of &quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;Poppa&quot; that is his nickname on the show&#x2014;says season two has great things in store for Maura. &quot;Because the central conceit of the show was that the trans person is the most normal person in this family, and because in season one we were sort of introducing America to the idea of trans-ness, we didn&apos;t give Maura as many unlikable moments as we could have,&quot; Soloway says. Thanks in part to Jenner, &quot;America is kind of caught up now. So we can allow Maura to be more vulnerable, to not be a saint, to fall in love, screw up, make enemies.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.18">I tell all this to Tambor as he prepares to deliver me back to the Katonah train station, and he looks pleased. &quot;Remember Willy Loman? <em>I&apos;m liked but not well-liked,</em>&quot; he recites, paraphrasing <em>Death of a Salesman</em>. His 10-year-old son, Gabriel, has joined us, as there&apos;s a Cub Scout meeting they need to get to. Gabe is talking about a biography of Albert Einstein he&apos;s reading, and Tambor sounds like very much the proud father. &quot;Isn&apos;t he great?&quot; he says. &quot;I could weep.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.19">He putters around the kitchen, and at one point asks me sweetly, &quot;Shall I make you a sandwich?&quot; When I decline, we pile back into the massive four-by-four. &quot;Are we all buckled? Is everybody buckled?&quot; Tambor booms, Moppa-like. Then, to Gabe, after a glance at the cup holder: &quot;Let&apos;s go get our dog!&quot;</p><div class="embed figure" data-reactid=".5e4y5v79q8.1.1.0.0.4.1a"><figure class="embedded-video"><iframe
