  	    "articleBody": "Back in December of 2012, as John Boehner was trying and failing to get his GOP colleagues to support his \u0022Plan B\u0022 for avoiding the fiscal cliff, the Speaker stood in front of the House Republican Conference and, on the verge of tears, recited the Serenity Prayer: \u0022God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\u0022 Three years ago—and many, many times since then—that meant accepting that he couldn\u0027t change his fellow House Republicans\u0027 minds. This morning, that meant changing the one thing he could—his job: Boehner announced that at the end of October, he will step down as Speaker and resign from Congress.\u000A\u000AThe proximate cause for Boehner\u0027s resignation is the upcoming budget battle over Planned Parenthood. Conservative House Republicans have pledged to shut down the federal government rather than vote for a budget bill that includes funding for Planned Parenthood—a fight that will come to a head next week. Even if Boehner wins that fight, it\u0027s almost certain that he\u0027d then face a challenge to his Speakership from angry conservatives. Although he\u0027s stared down such challenges in the past, it would promise to be a bloodier affair this time (with 28 Republicans reportedly already committed to voting against him), and even if Boehner did survive, he\u0027d be sorely hobbled.\u000A\u000AEven more than these short-term threats, the larger reality is that the job of being Speaker of the House has become a miserable one. After Republicans took back the House in the 2010 midterms and Boehner then took the gavel from Nancy Pelosi in 2011, he was immediately confronted with an angry, restive caucus—a third of which was made up of freshmen members who were quite sincere when they said they weren\u0027t going to play by the Washington rules. Those Tea Party freshmen made it impossible for Boehner, and his fellow establishment Republicans, to do much of anything. Not only was a \u0022grand bargain\u0022 on taxes and entitlement spending off the table, just basic tasks like raising the debt ceiling and keeping the federal government open became ongoing struggles.\u000A\u000AAnd those struggles were only about to get worse. With the presidential campaign in full swing and each Republican candidate trying to outdo the other when it comes to showing how much he\u0027ll shake up Washington, the next year promised to be a series of ongoing shutdown dramas, with politicians like Texas senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz constantly pushing Congress to the brink only so that he could accuse Boehner of \u0022surrender politics\u0022 for trying to bring it back from the ledge. It\u0027s little wonder that last month, Boehner told a group of 100 Republicans at a Colorado fundraiser that Cruz was a \u0022jackass.\u0022\u000A\u000ANow, dealing with Cruz and other assorted jackasses will likely be Kevin McCarthy\u0027s job. The California congressman, who\u0027s currently the House Majority leader, has had a meteoric rise since he was first elected in 2006—his success largely stemming from, first, his tireless fundraising and campaigning on behalf of the Tea Partiers who ran for Congress in 2010 and, second, his continued cultivation (through bike trips, granola bars, and other means) of those Tea Partiers once they got to Congress. But don\u0027t expect these restless Republicans to treat McCarthy any better than they did Boehner. Once he\u0027s Speaker, he\u0027ll have to do the same things, and make the same compromises, Boehner did, and he, too, will become the enemy.\u000A\u000AFor his four years as Speaker, Boehner\u0027s greatest accomplishment was survival—holding on to his job while so many members of his own party, even at times his top lieutenant, were plotting against him. But at a certain point, there\u0027s no satisfaction to be had when survival becomes an end in and of itself. Could Boehner have survived as Speaker the next week and then the next year? Quite possibly, yes. The question he faced, though, is why would he even want to? In the end, Boehner basically said, \u0022Take this job and shove it.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AJason Zengerle is GQ\u0027s Political Correspondent",

Conservative House Republicans have pledged to shut down the federal government rather than vote for a budget bill that includes funding for Planned Parenthood&#x2014;a fight that will come to a head next week. Even if Boehner wins that fight, it&apos;s almost certain that he&apos;d then face a challenge to his Speakership from angry conservatives. Although he&apos;s <a href="http://www.thewire.com/politics/2013/01/secret-ipad-list-bring-down-boehner/60592/">stared down such challenges</a> in the past, it would promise to be a bloodier affair this time (with 28 Republicans <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/08/exclusive-mulvaney-boehner-lacks-enough-gop-votes-for-re-election-his-future-depends-on-whether-dems-bail-him-out/">reportedly</a> already committed to voting against him), and even if Boehner did survive, he&apos;d be sorely hobbled.</p><p data-reactid=".fj5av1lyps.1.1.0.0.4.2">Even more than these short-term threats, the larger reality is that the job of being Speaker of the House has become a miserable one. After Republicans took back the House in the 2010 midterms and Boehner then took the gavel from Nancy Pelosi in 2011, he was immediately confronted with an angry, restive caucus&#x2014;a third of which was made up of freshmen members who were quite sincere when they said they weren&apos;t going to play by the Washington rules. Those Tea Party freshmen made it impossible for Boehner, and his fellow establishment Republicans, to do much of anything. Not only was a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/magazine/obama-vs-boehner-who-killed-the-debt-deal.html">&quot;grand bargain&quot;</a> on taxes and entitlement spending off the table, just basic tasks like raising the debt ceiling and keeping the federal government open became ongoing struggles.</p><p data-reactid=".fj5av1lyps.1.1.0.0.4.3">And those struggles were only about to get worse. With the presidential campaign in full swing and each Republican candidate trying to outdo the other when it comes to showing how much he&apos;ll shake up Washington, the next year promised to be a series of ongoing shutdown dramas, with politicians like Texas senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz constantly pushing Congress to the brink only so that he could accuse Boehner of <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/ted-cruz-republican-party-surrender-213179">&quot;surrender politics&quot;</a> for trying to bring it back from the ledge. It&apos;s little wonder that last month, Boehner told a group of 100 Republicans at a Colorado fundraiser that Cruz was a &quot;jackass.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".fj5av1lyps.1.1.0.0.4.5">Now, dealing with Cruz and other assorted jackasses will likely be Kevin McCarthy&apos;s job. The California congressman, who&apos;s currently the House Majority leader, has had a meteoric rise since he was first elected in 2006&#x2014;his success largely stemming from, first, his tireless fundraising and campaigning on behalf of the Tea Partiers who ran for Congress in 2010 and, second, his continued cultivation (through <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/magazine/how-kevin-mccarthy-wrangles-the-tea-party.html">bike trips, granola bars</a>, and other means) of those Tea Partiers once they got to Congress. But don&apos;t expect these restless Republicans to treat McCarthy any better than they did Boehner. Once he&apos;s Speaker, he&apos;ll have to do the same things, and make the same compromises, Boehner did, and he, too, will become the enemy.</p><p data-reactid=".fj5av1lyps.1.1.0.0.4.6">For his four years as Speaker, Boehner&apos;s greatest accomplishment was survival&#x2014;holding on to his job while so many members of his own party, even at times his <a href="http://nymag.com/news/politics/eric-cantor-2011-10/">top lieutenant</a>, were plotting against him. But at a certain point, there&apos;s no satisfaction to be had when survival becomes an end in and of itself. Could Boehner have survived as Speaker the next week and then the next year? Quite possibly, yes. The question he faced, though, is why would he even want to? In the end, Boehner basically said, &quot;Take this job and shove it.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".fj5av1lyps.1.1.0.0.4.7"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".fj5av1lyps.1.1.0.0.4.8">Jason
