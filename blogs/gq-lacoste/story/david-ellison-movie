Have you ever had dinner with someone whose father owns an island? A Hawaiian island? Have you ever toured someone\u0027s gleaming airplane hangar, in which he houses his actual airplanes? Have you ever met someone whom you could refer to, clearly and comprehensibly, in a text to someone else simply by using the emoji for a bag of money? Because I have.\u000A\u000A It is so tacky to talk about money, I know. And in stories like these, there is always money. Everyone is at least baseline famous- person richwhich, to be clear, is very rich. These are people who have landed on a helipad within the past, say, six months. They have soft hands and vacation homes that aren\u0027t time-shares. You sort of ignore the money because it\u0027s always there. It\u0027s regular.\u000A\u000A But this isn\u0027t that kind of story, this isn\u0027t that kind of rich. This is eighth-largest-yacht- in-the-world rich. This is $12-million-house- in-Malibu rich. This is it-ends-up-that-Ferrari-costs-$233,509 (which I know because I\u0027m disgusting and I Googled it from the elevator of the hotel after he dropped me off ) rich. This is so rich that you could do many foolish things with your money and still never be in any danger of being poor, never be in danger of winding up even base- line famous-person rich.\u000A\u000A This is the story of David Ellison, Silicon Valley scion, gazillionaire movie producer and CEO of Skydance, the man who had big roles in the twin behemoth July releases of Mission: ImpossibleRogue Nation and Terminator Genisys. This is the story of a man who bought his way into Hollywood because he was rich and stayed there because he was good. It\u0027s a fun story, and so we\u0027re telling it. The question is: Why is he?\u000A\u000AANOTHER THING I\u0027ve learned about people who are baseline famous-person rich: They are careful not to remind you how rich they are when you\u0027re writ- ing about them. They show up in their regular-person clothes. Ari Emanuel used to drive a Prius. For a while, Jeffrey Katzenberg drove a worthless \u002790s-era Mustang. Once, an actor I interviewed asked me not to write that he was wear- ing Prada sneakers.\u000A\u000A David Ellison makes no effort to disguise his wealth. When he walks into the Spitfire Grill at the Santa Monica airport, just a quick Ferrari ride from his two actual airplanes, he apologizes for being late. He was out at the family\u0027s spread in Palm Springs last night so that he could attend the tennis match early this morning in Indian Wells. He flew his own helicopter back but had to\u000A\u000A reverse it because of fog, so he quickly chartered a jet. He is only fifteen minutes late.\u000A\u000A Ellison is tall and blond, with skin so tan and eyebrows so light that they cancel each other out and manage to give off the golden glow of the genetically sparkling. He goes to the gym every morning; everyone tells me he\u0027s incredibly disciplined. He is either very guarded or very square, beginning his anecdotes with phrases like \u0022I\u0027ll never forget...\u0022 and laughing as he tells me a story about a time when he was naughty but in reality wasn\u0027t naughty at all. Over the course of our four meetings, he\u0027ll sometimes go back to a previous conversation and restate some- thing, just to make sure I\u0027ve understood him.\u000A\u000A There\u0027s a reason for that. This is the first time David Ellison has ever agreed to be profiled. He has talked about his business, his movies, but he\u0027s never done this. (Omert is a family tradition: His father is the media-shy former Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, the third-richest person in America, a country full of rich people; his sister is extremely-media-shy Megan Ellison, founder of the movie company Annapurna, which made Her, Zero Dark Thirty, and American Hustle, movies that are almost diametrically opposed financially and artistically to the fare David produces.) There are only a few reasons that someone like David would want to do a profile. One is so that people will know his name. But we already know the Ellison name. So it has to be the other reason: to get out from under it.\u000A\u000ADAVID ELLISON realized he was David Ellison relatively late in the game, and he remembers the exact moment. He was 14 years old. \u0022I\u0027ll never forget,\u0022 he begins. It was freshman orientation day at his new private high school in the Bay Area, when behind him he heard some kid say, \u0022Hey, I hear Larry Ellison\u0027s son goes to school here. I\u0027m going to make friends with that kid. He\u0027s my boy.\u0022 David turned around and stuck his hand out and said, \u0022Hi, I\u0027m David, very nice to meet you.\u0022 David, now 32, tells this like it\u0027s the sickest burn in the world. I would not call David Ellison edgy.\u000A\u000A David and Megan, three years younger, were raised by their mother, Barbara Boothe, the third of Larry\u0027s now four wives. (They split up shortly after Megan\u0027s birth.) They weren\u0027t poor, he knew thatthey just seemed like a Silicon Valley family that was well-off. But David noticed that the houses were gradually getting bigger, and it was like a frog in slowly boiling water.\u000A\u000A Barbara made sure her kids inherited her work ethic, giving them chores and $5 weekly allowances. She loved movies, and the three of them would gather in the family room they referred to as their own personal Blockbuster, complete with more than 3,000 VHS movies. They\u0027d watch the same ones over and over: all three Star Wars movies, back to back, Jurassic Park, the original Terminator, Back to the Future.\u000A\u000A \u0022After one viewing, he\u0027d be able to quote the whole thing back verbatim,\u0022 Megan told me. \u0022I was always so blown away by it, just because I could never do it. And then also it sometimes drove me crazy. Shut up and let us watch the movie.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A They didn\u0027t see a lot of Larry in those yearshe wasn\u0027t absentee, but it would be hard to call him an involved parent, except financially. \u0022I spent, you know, the obligatory weekends with the kids,\u0022 Larry told me. \u0022But that\u0027s very different when they\u0027re 5, 6, 7, and 8 than when they become teenagers. And then a lot of the interests teenagers have are the same interests adults have.\u0022\u000A\u000A David and Larry\u0027s first intersection was a form of stunt flying known as aerobat- ics. At 13, David reminded his parents of a promise they\u0027d made when he was only 3 years old: that he\u0027d be allowed to learn how to fly an airplane when he became a teenager. He immediately found the freedom intoxicating. \u0022The thing I always loved about aerobatic flying is it was actually one of the few opportunities where you could actually do something that nobody had ever done before,\u0022 David says. Larry took lessons with him, and they learned together. On David\u0027s sixteenth birthday, he flew an Extra 300, one of the top-performing aerobatic airplanes. (Later that day he failed his driver\u0027s test.)\u000A\u000A He tells me he had \u0022a little too much fun in high school,\u0022 but when I press him for debauched cocaine hot-tub Less Than Zero rich-guy-villain storiesnow we\u0027re getting somewhere, I thinkall he can talk about is the aeronautics: how they\u0027d fly too close to the ground, how they\u0027d go pylon racing around trees that were only fifteen feet high. He never touched alcohol or drugs; flying was the most important thing to him, and such vices are strictly verboten: Caught once, you might never fly again. \u0022An awful lot of kids who grow up with privilege do silly things,\u0022 Larry told me. \u0022David matured quickly, I think because of the flying. He knew the kind of flying he was doing, it\u0027s not like a video game there are no extra lives.\u0022\u000A\u000A He spent two summers in high school working for his father at Oracle, building websites, but his interest in software waned fast. He started college at Pepperdine, for business, but quickly transferred to USC for film school. (Megan was the boom opera- tor on his senior-thesis movie.) In 2006, he dropped out to finance Flyboys, a World War I fighter-pilot movie starring James Franco and co-starring David Ellison.\u000A\u000A The stunt flier got to appear in his very own stunt-flier movie, but the movie crashed. It had cost $60 million to make and earned only $13 million. (From The Globe and Mail: \u0022The creators of Flyboys know no image too clichd, no narrative convention too exhausted and no psycho- logical motivation too pat.\u0022) Because of David\u0027s last name, Hollywood was watch- ing to see if he was truly dedicatedif he really had talentor if he was what they call \u0022dumb money,\u0022 industry vernacular for a guy who rolls into town wanting a piece of the glitz and flames out twice as quickly.\u000A\u000A He was heartbrokenno, literally. He took to bed and, eventually, the hospital. He had gone into atrial fibrillation \u0022as a result of how depressed I got over it.\u0022 Once cardioverted, though, he was back at it, this time with Northern Lights, which he co-wrote, the very personal story of his best friend and flying buddy, Nick Nilmeyer, who was killed a few years earlier when his plane crashed. Taylor Lautner signed on to play Nick, then asked who would play Ellison. David Ellison\u0027s answer was David Ellison, and with that Lautner walked away from the deal, another humiliation. The movie was dead. The town had been right: another heir, another flameout. In most of these stories, the guy limps away and goes off to\u000A\u000A invest in tech stocks and widgets, a Variety footnote. Right here is when it should have been over for David.\u000A\u000ABACK WHEN DAVID told his father he wanted to make movies, Larry said he shouldn\u0027t do it until he was able to answer this question: What will you do if you fail? David\u0027s answer was that he\u0027d get a job as a junior executive at a studio. He was never going to leave. He\u0027d stay and deal with the mess he made.\u000A\u000A And clean up that mess he did. Chalk it up to what his sister calls his \u0022endless drive\u0022 and \u0022endless determination.\u0022 He realized that he\u0027d have to walk away from acting, which he did, though it didn\u0027t stop those stories from haunting him. Even now, during our second meeting, he reminds me that acting was never his primary focus. He calls his dabbling accidental, says it never meant that much to him, and that may be true, though it may also be true that when you fail at something, it\u0027s only human to try to walk back from it.\u000A\u000A See, when you\u0027re an Ellison, one epic humiliation won\u0027t ruin you. Not by a long shot. He learned his lessons, vowed to pick properties and partners more wisely. In 2009, Skydance reached a four-year co-financing arrangement with Paramount, important since Paramount had reportedly just walked away from a $450 million deal with Deutsche Bank, and he could bring at least that much to the table. Then Paramount sent him the screenplay for True Grit, an unlikely marriage with the Coen brothers that would earn ten Oscarnomi- nations. Next he executive-produced World War Z, the Brad Pitt zombie thriller whose production was so expensive and so troubled it garnered an actual Vanity Fair cover cataloging its woes. Again, David seemed to be failing while Hollywood watched, but this\u000A\u000A time he recovered again. He opened up his endless coffers to help pay for reshoots, and Damon Lindelof was hired for rewrites. The movie wound up being a massive hit, and a sequel is in the works.\u000A\u000A In his time running Skydance, he has helped resurrect Star Trek and rejuvenate Mission: Impossible. And he has no less than famed fellow aeronautic and M:I star Tom Cruise singing his praises to me: \u0022It\u0027s his approach, you know? You\u0027re trained as a pilot, you have to understand and learn the limitations of the airplane. In aerobatics you have to push right to the edge of thatwhat is going to keep the wing flying and when you\u0027re going into a stall and understanding the limitations of that, and your own limitations.\u0022 In slightly less metaphoric terms, \u0022the thing that I admire about David is that he\u0027s not afraid to pick up a shovel and dig.\u0022 Okay, last try: \u0022I want to entertain the audience, I always have, and I want people who are equally as dedicated and we\u0027re all there to try to make each other better.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere are people making very good livings in Hollywood who outsource the expertise that Tom Cruise told me David has made it his mission to learn for himself. Because what is left for the man whose greatest failures can never turn into true ruin? What is left for a man who will still find success even if he is mediocre? What is left is this: to work very hard and to be much, much more than what was predicted for you. \u0022I formed Skydance because I love movies,\u0022 he says. \u0022I wanted to create a place where we would be able to make the movies that everybody at the company loves watching and loves becoming a part of.\u0022 What he means to say, what he can\u0027t possibly say, what he\u0027s too self- conscious to say is: I won.\u000A\u000ATaffy Brodesser-Akner is a  GQ correspondent.",

Have you ever had dinner with someone whose father owns an island? A Hawaiian island? Have you ever toured someone&#x2019;s gleaming airplane hangar, in which he houses his actual airplanes? Have you ever met someone whom you could refer to, clearly and comprehensibly, in a text to someone else simply by using the emoji for a bag of money? Because I have.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.2"> It is so tacky to talk about money, I know. And in stories like these, there is <em>always</em> money. Everyone is at least baseline famous- person richwhich, to be clear, is very rich. These are people who have landed on a helipad within the past, say, six months. They have soft hands and vacation homes that aren&#x2019;t time-shares. You sort of ignore the money because it&#x2019;s always there. It&#x2019;s regular.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.3"> But this isn&#x2019;t that kind of story, this isn&#x2019;t that kind of rich. This is eighth-largest-yacht- in-the-world rich. This is $12-million-house- in-Malibu rich. This is it-ends-up-that-Ferrari-costs-$233,509 (which I know because I&#x2019;m disgusting and I Googled it from the elevator of the hotel after he dropped me off ) rich. This is so rich that you could do many foolish things with your money and still never be in any danger of being poor, never be in danger of winding up even base- line famous-person rich.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.5"> This is the story of David Ellison, Silicon Valley scion, gazillionaire movie producer and CEO of Skydance, the man who had big roles in the twin behemoth July releases of <em>Mission: ImpossibleRogue Nation</em> and <em>Terminator Genisys</em>. This is the story of a man who bought his way into Hollywood because he was rich and stayed there because he was good. It&#x2019;s a fun story, and so we&#x2019;re telling it. The question is: Why is he?</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.6">ANOTHER THING I&#x2019;ve learned about people who are baseline famous-person rich: They are careful not to remind you how rich they are when you&#x2019;re writ- ing about them. They show up in their regular-person clothes. Ari Emanuel used to drive a Prius. For a while, Jeffrey Katzenberg drove a worthless &#x2019;90s-era Mustang. Once, an actor I interviewed asked me not to write that he was wear- ing Prada sneakers.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.7"> David Ellison makes no effort to disguise his wealth. When he walks into the Spitfire Grill at the Santa Monica airport, just a quick Ferrari ride from his two actual airplanes, he apologizes for being late. He was out at the family&#x2019;s spread in Palm Springs last night so that he could attend the tennis match early this morning in Indian Wells. He flew his own helicopter back but had to</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.8"> reverse it because of fog, so he quickly chartered a jet. He is only fifteen minutes late.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.9"> Ellison is tall and blond, with skin so tan and eyebrows so light that they cancel each other out and manage to give off the golden glow of the genetically sparkling. He goes to the gym every morning; everyone tells me he&#x2019;s incredibly disciplined. He is either very guarded or very square, beginning his anecdotes with phrases like &quot;I&#x2019;ll never forget...&quot; and laughing as he tells me a story about a time when he was naughty but in reality wasn&#x2019;t naughty at all. Over the course of our four meetings, he&#x2019;ll sometimes go back to a previous conversation and restate some- thing, just to make sure I&#x2019;ve understood him.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.a"> There&#x2019;s a reason for that. This is the first time David Ellison has ever agreed to be profiled. He has talked about his business, his movies, but he&#x2019;s never done <em>this</em>. (Omert is a family tradition: His father is the media-shy former Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, the third-richest person in America, a country full of rich people; his sister is extremely-media-shy Megan Ellison, founder of the movie company Annapurna, which made <em>Her, Zero Dark Thirty</em>, and <em>American Hustle</em>, movies that are almost diametrically opposed financially and artistically to the fare David produces.) There are only a few reasons that someone like David would want to do a profile. One is so that people will know his name. But we already know the Ellison name. So it has to be the other reason: to get out from under it.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.b">DAVID ELLISON realized he was David Ellison relatively late in the game, and he remembers the exact moment. He was 14 years old. &quot;I&#x2019;ll never forget,&quot; he begins. It was freshman orientation day at his new private high school in the Bay Area, when behind him he heard some kid say, &quot;Hey, I hear Larry Ellison&#x2019;s son goes to school here. I&#x2019;m going to make friends with that kid. He&#x2019;s my boy.&quot; David turned around and stuck his hand out and said, &quot;Hi, I&#x2019;m David, very nice to meet you.&quot; David, now 32, tells this like it&#x2019;s the sickest burn in the world. I would not call David Ellison edgy.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.c"> David and Megan, three years younger, were raised by their mother, Barbara Boothe, the third of Larry&#x2019;s now four wives. (They split up shortly after Megan&#x2019;s birth.) They weren&#x2019;t poor, he knew thatthey just seemed like a Silicon Valley family that was well-off. But David noticed that the houses were gradually getting bigger, and it was like a frog in slowly boiling water.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Barbara made sure her kids inherited her work ethic, giving them chores and $5 weekly allowances. She loved movies, and the three of them would gather in the family room they referred to as their own personal Blockbuster, complete with more than 3,000 VHS movies. They&#x2019;d watch the same ones over and over: all three <em>Star Wars</em> movies, back to back, <em>Jurassic Park</em>, the original <em>Terminator, Back to the Future</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.e"> &quot;After one viewing, he&#x2019;d be able to quote the whole thing back verbatim,&quot; Megan told me. &quot;I was always so blown away by it, just because I could never do it. And then also it sometimes drove me crazy. Shut up and let us watch the movie.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.f"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5592feee7cc23bc8642421f9/master/w_806/entertainment-2015-06-david-ellison-david-ellison-gq-july-2015-02.jpg" alt="entertainment-2015-06-david-ellison-david-ellison-gq-july-2015-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdavid-ellison-movie&amp;t=entertainment-2015-06-david-ellison-david-ellison-gq-july-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdavid-ellison-movie&amp;t=entertainment-2015-06-david-ellison-david-ellison-gq-july-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdavid-ellison-movie&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5592feee7cc23bc8642421f9%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-06-david-ellison-david-ellison-gq-july-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-06-david-ellison-david-ellison-gq-july-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdavid-ellison-movie&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5592feee7cc23bc8642421f9%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-06-david-ellison-david-ellison-gq-july-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-06-david-ellison-david-ellison-gq-july-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.g"> They didn&#x2019;t see a lot of Larry in those yearshe wasn&#x2019;t absentee, but it would be hard to call him an involved parent, except financially. &quot;I spent, you know, the obligatory weekends with the kids,&quot; Larry told me. &quot;But that&#x2019;s very different when they&#x2019;re 5, 6, 7, and 8 than when they become teenagers. And then a lot of the interests teenagers have are the same interests adults have.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.h"> David and Larry&#x2019;s first intersection was a form of stunt flying known as aerobat- ics. At 13, David reminded his parents of a promise they&#x2019;d made when he was only 3 years old: that he&#x2019;d be allowed to learn how to fly an airplane when he became a teenager. He immediately found the freedom intoxicating. &quot;The thing I always loved about aerobatic flying is it was actually one of the few opportunities where you could actually do something that nobody had ever done before,&quot; David says. Larry took lessons with him, and they learned together. On David&#x2019;s sixteenth birthday, he flew an Extra 300, one of the top-performing aerobatic airplanes. (Later that day he failed his driver&#x2019;s test.)</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.i"> He tells me he had &quot;a little too much fun in high school,&quot; but when I press him for debauched cocaine hot-tub <em>Less Than Zero</em> rich-guy-villain storiesnow we&#x2019;re getting somewhere, I thinkall he can talk about is the aeronautics: how they&#x2019;d fly too close to the ground, how they&#x2019;d go pylon racing around trees that were only fifteen feet high. He never touched alcohol or drugs; flying was the most important thing to him, and such vices are strictly verboten: Caught once, you might never fly again. &quot;An awful lot of kids who grow up with privilege do silly things,&quot; Larry told me. &quot;David matured quickly, I think because of the flying. He knew the kind of flying he was doing, it&#x2019;s not like a video game there are no extra lives.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.j"> He spent two summers in high school working for his father at Oracle, building websites, but his interest in software waned fast. He started college at Pepperdine, for business, but quickly transferred to USC for film school. (Megan was the boom opera- tor on his senior-thesis movie.) In 2006, he dropped out to finance <em>Flyboys</em>, a World War I fighter-pilot movie starring James Franco and co-starring David Ellison.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.k"> The stunt flier got to appear in his very own stunt-flier movie, but the movie crashed. It had cost $60 million to make and earned only $13 million. (From <em>The Globe and Mail</em>: &quot;The creators of <em>Flyboys</em> know no image too clichd, no narrative convention too exhausted and no psycho- logical motivation too pat.&quot;) Because of David&#x2019;s last name, Hollywood was watch- ing to see if he was truly dedicatedif he really had talentor if he was what they call &quot;dumb money,&quot; industry vernacular for a guy who rolls into town wanting a piece of the glitz and flames out twice as quickly.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.l"> He was heartbrokenno, literally. He took to bed and, eventually, the hospital. He had gone into atrial fibrillation &quot;as a result of how depressed I got over it.&quot; Once cardioverted, though, he was back at it, this time with <em>Northern Lights</em>, which he co-wrote, the very personal story of his best friend and flying buddy, Nick Nilmeyer, who was killed a few years earlier when his plane crashed. Taylor Lautner signed on to play Nick, then asked who would play Ellison. David Ellison&#x2019;s answer was David Ellison, and with that Lautner walked away from the deal, another humiliation. The movie was dead. The town had been right: another heir, another flameout. In most of these stories, the guy limps away and goes off to</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.m"> invest in tech stocks and widgets, a Variety footnote. Right here is when it should have been over for David.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.n">BACK WHEN DAVID told his father he wanted to make movies, Larry said he shouldn&#x2019;t do it until he was able to answer this question: What will you do if you fail? David&#x2019;s answer was that he&#x2019;d get a job as a junior executive at a studio. He was never going to leave. He&#x2019;d stay and deal with the mess he made.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.o"> And clean up that mess he did. Chalk it up to what his sister calls his &quot;endless drive&quot; and &quot;endless determination.&quot; He realized that he&#x2019;d have to walk away from acting, which he did, though it didn&#x2019;t stop those stories from haunting him. Even now, during our second meeting, he reminds me that acting was never his primary focus. He calls his dabbling accidental, says it never meant that much to him, and that may be true, though it may also be true that when you fail at something, it&#x2019;s only human to try to walk back from it.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.p"> See, when you&#x2019;re an Ellison, one epic humiliation won&#x2019;t ruin you. Not by a long shot. He learned his lessons, vowed to pick properties and partners more wisely. In 2009, Skydance reached a four-year co-financing arrangement with Paramount, important since Paramount had reportedly just walked away from a $450 million deal with Deutsche Bank, and he could bring at least that much to the table. Then Paramount sent him the screenplay for <em>True Grit</em>, an unlikely marriage with the Coen brothers that would earn ten Oscarnomi- nations. Next he executive-produced <em>World War Z</em>, the Brad Pitt zombie thriller whose production was so expensive and so troubled it garnered an actual <em>Vanity Fair</em> cover cataloging its woes. Again, David seemed to be failing while Hollywood watched, but this</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.q"> time he recovered again. He opened up his endless coffers to help pay for reshoots, and Damon Lindelof was hired for rewrites. The movie wound up being a massive hit, and a sequel is in the works.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.r"> In his time running Skydance, he has helped resurrect <em>Star Trek</em> and rejuvenate <em>Mission: Impossible</em>. And he has no less than famed fellow aeronautic and M:I star Tom Cruise singing his praises to me: &quot;It&#x2019;s his approach, you know? You&#x2019;re trained as a pilot, you have to understand and learn the limitations of the airplane. In aerobatics you have to push right to the edge of thatwhat is going to keep the wing flying and when you&#x2019;re going into a stall and understanding the limitations of that, and your own limitations.&quot; In slightly less metaphoric terms, &quot;the thing that I admire about David is that he&#x2019;s not afraid to pick up a shovel and dig.&quot; Okay, last try: &quot;I want to entertain the audience, I always have, and I want people who are equally as dedicated and we&#x2019;re all there to try to make each other better.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.s">There are people making very good livings in Hollywood who outsource the expertise that Tom Cruise told me David has made it his mission to learn for himself. Because what is left for the man whose greatest failures can never turn into true ruin? What is left for a man who will still find success even if he is mediocre? What is left is this: to work very hard and to be much, much more than what was predicted for you. &quot;I formed Skydance because I love movies,&quot; he says. &quot;I wanted to create a place where we would be able to make the movies that everybody at the company loves watching and loves becoming a part of.&quot; What he means to say, what he can&#x2019;t possibly say, what he&#x2019;s too self- conscious to say is: I won.</p><p data-reactid=".58oadcdce8.1.1.0.0.4.t"><a href="../contributors/taffy-brodesser-akner">Taffy Brodesser-Akner</a> <em>is a </em> GQ
