  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ASome call Brian Hunt of Moonlight Brewing a loner. Others a shaman. One thing is for sure: he makes some of the most far-out, cultish beers in the world. In this excerpt from A Brewer\u0027s Tale: A History of the World According to Beer__, writer William Bostwick makes a pilgrimage to Brian\u0027s hidden forest brewery to taste his otherworldly concoctions—beers brewed with twigs, anyone?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ABrian Hunt and I sat under a redwood tree in his rutted, gravel driveway. We were in rural Sonoma County, California, somewhere around Santa Rosa. Where, precisely? Neither I nor my dashboard Garmin was sure. Among the towering trees and gnarled, rolling vineyard hills, cell signals fizzled, GPS was useless. I was lost.\u000A\u000AI had come here to find a recluse. Brian brews under the name Moonlight, and his beers, though only available in the Bay Area, are cult favorites for those in the know. His black lager Death and Tas is a craft-beer-bar staple around these parts. Brian says he specifically engineered its iced-coffee-like roasty kick to pair with carne asada tacos. It\u0027s the coal-hued yin to the bright, citrusy yang of other local standards like Lagunitas IPA. Death and Tas is, as the name implies, a reliable classic. But I had heard that, if you can find it, Brian\u0027s hidden forest brewery traffics in more curious wares. Some call him a curmudgeonly loner; others a shaman. Either way, Brian doesn\u0027t reveal his tricks easily. He can be gruff on the phone; emails are curt. His first to me, when I asked for an interview, began \u0022I am difficult to pin down.\u0022 \u0022Emails are unreliable,\u0022 he wrote. \u0022Chaos here now.\u0022 I could come if I wanted, and if I could find the place. No promises.\u000A\u000ATo visit the shaman, I had to make a pilgrimage. I drove north on Highway 101, pulled off around the manicured Kendall Jackson winery chateau, and jogged west on a furrow-straight, farm-country lane, past billboards advertising local vineyards\u0027 gold-medal pinots and tasting-room hours. I turned onto a signless dirt road, then another, even dirtier road (was it a road or a driveway?), bouncing between pine trees and hop trellises, and parked next to a dusty Dodge Sprinter van and even dustier pick-up truck. I glanced at the license plates: \u0022HALFBBL\u0022 and \u0022CRZYLUN.\u0022 I met Brian in the brewery, squeezing around a pile of empty kegs into an airless barn stuffed with buckets and kettles and hoses, all seemingly half-operational, or half-broken, depending on one\u0027s perspective. On the wall, a stained scrap of paper read \u0022beer is not an industrialized product.\u0022 As if, here, where Brian and I now slouched in weathered adirondack chairs among a pile of open bottles, there were any other choice.\u000A\u000ABrian slumped deeper in his chair. He seemed to get more feral from the top down, his neat, close-cropped white hair giving way to a scraggly beard that drained over his neck into the frayed collar of his t-shirt. Below that, washed-out jeans, out of which poked a pair of bare, hairy, hobbit-like feet, as if he were growing roots. Brian toed aside an open can of gasoline, saying its fumes were interfering with our beer tasting and opened a new bottle. Number five? Number six? Our drinks, too, had gone off the grid. What they were, exactly, was hard to figure. One beer tasted like Coca-Cola, another like Twizzlers. One, like peach fuzz, musty and sweet; another minty, cedar-like and cool.\u000A\u000A\u0022Taste this,\u0022 he said. The beer opened bready and dark with a hint of hazelnuts, like a slice of rich, country toast. And then, something odd. Licorice? A touch of grated orange peel? A sprinkle of sage? \u0022Nope,\u0022 Brian said, a glint in his eye, and plucked a branch from overhead. \u0022Now, nibble on that.\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027d munched raw brewing grain, crushed open hop cones to smell the fresh resin, slurped bubbling beer straight from the fermenter. But in all my brewery tours—in all my life—I had never eaten a tree. Brian seemed disappointed at this, as if I had confessed to never really listening to the Beatles. With a frown, he patiently walked me through the process: \u0022Back where it\u0027s barky, you get tannins, like when you leave a tea bag steeping for too long. The palest growth, the tips, are very citrusy. Crunch them with your teeth so you crack them open,\u0022 he told me. \u0022When the weather is cooler, the twigs come up light green. Fluorescent, almost. This year, \u0027cause the weather was so different, I couldn\u0027t get as much of that as I wanted. I got more of the dark green, piney flavors. It tastes like a Christmas tree, or even a little licorice-y, like an adult Dr. Pepper.\u0022 He smiled—the first time today. \u0022I don\u0027t think they use redwood in theirs, though.\u0022 This was the secret to that beer. Brian calls it Working for Tips, and he brews it with these very branches. Picking bark from my teeth, I felt brave enough to gently wonder at his methods. Where\u0027d he get such a crazy idea? From whence this deep-rooted understanding, this friendliness with flora? I asked. \u0022Just by chewing,\u0022 he said with a shrug. \u0022You can\u0027t find an iPhone app to tell you when to pick the twigs. You gotta chew the tree.\u0022\u000A\u000ABrian likes tasting Working for Tips with self-described hop heads, IPA-mad craft-beer geeks who might pass by Brian\u0027s two-bit setup without even noticing it on their pilgrimages to Russian River, a brewpub down the road in Santa Rosa. Russian River is best known for its outrageously hoppy double IPA Pliny the Elder, and its even hopper, limited-edition sibling, Pliny the Younger. The Plinys are classics, Younger often cited as the best American IPA, if not the best American beer, if not the best beer, period. It\u0027s only available for a short time, and then only on tap at the brewery itself. If Brian\u0027s beers are cult hits, Russian River\u0027s are secret obsessions of which fans whisper with Skull-and-Bones like reverence. Release-day lines clog traffic downtown. Devotees have been caught filling water bottles with the precious nectar to take home as a trophy, or worse, re-sell on eBay. Uber-citrussy, packed with acidic strains of hops like Cascades and Simcoes, Younger tastes, to me, like a bitter Orange Crush. Faced with a beer that tastes, instead, like tree branches, the nerds scratch their heads and try to guess what secret variety of hops Brian is using. \u0022Their mind goes, \u0027oh, it\u0027s not Cascade. Is it Galaxy?\u0027\u0022 Brian laughs. \u0022\u0027Is it that new one with the code name, R-12-37?\u0027\u0022 Tricking nerds is one thing, but sharing his beer with the uninitiated is even more fun. Those lucky souls who think they know what beer is but don\u0027t yet know what it can be.\u000A\u000A\u0022So much of what people describe in beer is what they\u0027re thinking they\u0027re supposed to say—one of the 133 \u0027approved beer words,\u0027\u0022 Brian said. No, there aren\u0027t actually 133 official sensory terms, but flavor wheels and beer descriptions do tend to lean heavily on a select few: words like pine, citrus, spice, coffee, dark fruit. \u0022But we all have different memories of flavor. I remember one woman said about Tips, \u0027Wow, this reminds me of being in Vermont eating a maple candy lollipop,\u0027\u0022 he went on. \u0022She\u0027s tasting the tree sap. How perfect is that? And tree sap, that\u0027s not one of the 133 approved words. But even a person who tries it and goes, \u0027oh God, no!\u0027 I put a crack in them. I broke something, like breaking a bronco.\u0022 He points a hairy toe at the unlabeled bottles strewn about the driveway. \u0022I showed them that this is possible.\u0022\u000A\u000ABrian is a barefoot, Pan-like trickster, and his beers are magic. They exist in this world, but gesture beyond it. Rooted in one place, they transport the drinker to another: out to the Sierras, back to memories of family trips to New England, up into the treetops in Brian\u0027s yard. Brian is a shaman and this is his medicine: beers of transformation.\u000A\u000AOn that bright dusty afternoon, Working for Tips sent me deep into northern pine forests. As I sipped, the wine-country sun flickered off behind the boughs above, the air cooled and deadened, the world muffled in mist. Brian\u0027s yard was already off the grid; now, I was completely off the map. Here, there be monsters. A beer that tastes like trees? This isn\u0027t beer ... is it?\u000A\u000AWilliam Bostwick is the author of The Brewer\u0027s Tale: A History of the World According to Beer, which comes out today. He also compiled this list of the 50 Best Craft Beers. Read more at @brewerstale and brewerstale.tumblr.com\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestBrewers Tale_978-0-393-23914-0[6].jpg",

Hunt of Moonlight Brewing a loner. Others a shaman. One thing is for sure: he makes some of the most far-out, cultish beers in the world. In this excerpt from </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393239144/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0393239144&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=beecra-20&amp;linkId=EI7M7QV5VQ5U4A2B"><em>A Brewer&#x2019;s Tale</em></a><em>: A History of the World According to Beer__, writer William Bostwick makes a pilgrimage to Brian&#x2019;s hidden forest brewery to taste his otherworldly concoctions&#x2014;beers brewed with twigs, anyone?</em></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.2"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.3">Brian Hunt and I sat under a redwood tree in his rutted, gravel driveway. We were in rural Sonoma County, California, somewhere around Santa Rosa. Where, precisely? Neither I nor my dashboard Garmin was sure. Among the towering trees and gnarled, rolling vineyard hills, cell signals fizzled, GPS was useless. I was lost.</p><p data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.5">I had come here to find a recluse. Brian brews under the name Moonlight, and his beers, though only available in the Bay Area, are cult favorites for those in the know. His black lager Death and Tas is a craft-beer-bar staple around these parts. Brian says he specifically engineered its iced-coffee-like roasty kick to pair with carne asada tacos. It&#x2019;s the coal-hued yin to the bright, citrusy yang of other local standards like Lagunitas IPA. Death and Tas is, as the name implies, a reliable classic. But I had heard that, if you can find it, Brian&#x2019;s hidden forest brewery traffics in more curious wares. Some call him a curmudgeonly loner; others a shaman. Either way, Brian doesn&#x2019;t reveal his tricks easily. He can be gruff on the phone; emails are curt. His first to me, when I asked for an interview, began &quot;I am difficult to pin down.&quot; &quot;Emails are unreliable,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Chaos here now.&quot; I could come if I wanted, and if I could find the place. No promises.</p><p data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.6">To visit the shaman, I had to make a pilgrimage. I drove north on Highway 101, pulled off around the manicured Kendall Jackson winery chateau, and jogged west on a furrow-straight, farm-country lane, past billboards advertising local vineyards&#x2019; gold-medal pinots and tasting-room hours. I turned onto a signless dirt road, then another, even dirtier road (was it a road or a driveway?), bouncing between pine trees and hop trellises, and parked next to a dusty Dodge Sprinter van and even dustier pick-up truck. I glanced at the license plates: &quot;HALFBBL&quot; and &quot;CRZYLUN.&quot; I met Brian in the brewery, squeezing around a pile of empty kegs into an airless barn stuffed with buckets and kettles and hoses, all seemingly half-operational, or half-broken, depending on one&#x2019;s perspective. On the wall, a stained scrap of paper read &quot;beer is not an industrialized product.&quot; As if, here, where Brian and I now slouched in weathered adirondack chairs among a pile of open bottles, there were any other choice.</p><p data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.7">Brian slumped deeper in his chair. He seemed to get more feral from the top down, his neat, close-cropped white hair giving way to a scraggly beard that drained over his neck into the frayed collar of his t-shirt. Below that, washed-out jeans, out of which poked a pair of bare, hairy, hobbit-like feet, as if he were growing roots. Brian toed aside an open can of gasoline, saying its fumes were interfering with our beer tasting and opened a new bottle. Number five? Number six? Our drinks, too, had gone off the grid. What they were, exactly, was hard to figure. One beer tasted like Coca-Cola, another like Twizzlers. One, like peach fuzz, musty and sweet; another minty, cedar-like and cool.</p><p data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.8">&quot;Taste this,&quot; he said. The beer opened bready and dark with a hint of hazelnuts, like a slice of rich, country toast. And then, something odd. Licorice? A touch of grated orange peel? A sprinkle of sage? &quot;Nope,&quot; Brian said, a glint in his eye, and plucked a branch from overhead. &quot;Now, nibble on that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.9">I&#x2019;d munched raw brewing grain, crushed open hop cones to smell the fresh resin, slurped bubbling beer straight from the fermenter. But in all my brewery tours&#x2014;in all my life&#x2014;I had never eaten a tree. Brian seemed disappointed at this, as if I had confessed to never really listening to the Beatles. With a frown, he patiently walked me through the process: &quot;Back where it&#x2019;s barky, you get tannins, like when you leave a tea bag steeping for too long. The palest growth, the tips, are very citrusy. Crunch them with your teeth so you crack them open,&quot; he told me. &quot;When the weather is cooler, the twigs come up light green. Fluorescent, almost. This year, &#x2019;cause the weather was so different, I couldn&#x2019;t get as much of that as I wanted. I got more of the dark green, piney flavors. It tastes like a Christmas tree, or even a little licorice-y, like an adult Dr. Pepper.&quot; He smiled&#x2014;the first time today. &quot;I don&#x2019;t think they use redwood in theirs, though.&quot; This was the secret to that beer. Brian calls it Working for Tips, and he brews it with these very branches. Picking bark from my teeth, I felt brave enough to gently wonder at his methods. Where&#x2019;d he get such a crazy idea? From whence this deep-rooted understanding, this friendliness with flora? I asked. &quot;Just by chewing,&quot; he said with a shrug. &quot;You can&#x2019;t find an iPhone app to tell you when to pick the twigs. You gotta chew the tree.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.a">Brian likes tasting Working for Tips with self-described hop heads, IPA-mad craft-beer geeks who might pass by Brian&#x2019;s two-bit setup without even noticing it on their pilgrimages to Russian River, a brewpub down the road in Santa Rosa. Russian River is best known for its outrageously hoppy double IPA Pliny the Elder, and its even hopper, limited-edition sibling, Pliny the Younger. The Plinys are classics, Younger often cited as the best American IPA, if not the best American beer, if not the best beer, period. It&#x2019;s only available for a short time, and then only on tap at the brewery itself. If Brian&#x2019;s beers are cult hits, Russian River&#x2019;s are secret obsessions of which fans whisper with Skull-and-Bones like reverence. Release-day lines clog traffic downtown. Devotees have been caught filling water bottles with the precious nectar to take home as a trophy, or worse, re-sell on eBay. Uber-citrussy, packed with acidic strains of hops like Cascades and Simcoes, Younger tastes, to me, like a bitter Orange Crush. Faced with a beer that tastes, instead, like tree branches, the nerds scratch their heads and try to guess what secret variety of hops Brian is using. &quot;Their mind goes, &#x2019;oh, it&#x2019;s not Cascade. Is it Galaxy?&#x2019;&quot; Brian laughs. &quot;&#x2019;Is it that new one with the code name, R-12-37?&#x2019;&quot; Tricking nerds is one thing, but sharing his beer with the uninitiated is even more fun. Those lucky souls who think they know what beer <em>is</em> but don&#x2019;t yet know what it <em>can</em> be.</p><p data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.b">&quot;So much of what people describe in beer is what they&#x2019;re thinking they&#x2019;re supposed to say&#x2014;one of the 133 &#x2019;approved beer words,&#x2019;&quot; Brian said. No, there aren&#x2019;t <em>actually</em> 133 official sensory terms, but flavor wheels and beer descriptions do tend to lean heavily on a select few: words like pine, citrus, spice, coffee, dark fruit. &quot;But we all have different memories of flavor. I remember one woman said about Tips, &#x2019;Wow, this reminds me of being in Vermont eating a maple candy lollipop,&#x2019;&quot; he went on. &quot;She&#x2019;s tasting the tree sap. How perfect is that? And tree sap, that&#x2019;s not one of the 133 approved words. But even a person who tries it and goes, &#x2019;oh God, no!&#x2019; I put a crack in them. I broke something, like breaking a bronco.&quot; He points a hairy toe at the unlabeled bottles strewn about the driveway. &quot;I showed them that this is possible.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.c">Brian is a barefoot, Pan-like trickster, and his beers are magic. They exist in this world, but gesture beyond it. Rooted in one place, they transport the drinker to another: out to the Sierras, back to memories of family trips to New England, up into the treetops in Brian&#x2019;s yard. Brian is a shaman and this is his medicine: beers of transformation.</p><p data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.d">On that bright dusty afternoon, Working for Tips sent me deep into northern pine forests. As I sipped, the wine-country sun flickered off behind the boughs above, the air cooled and deadened, the world muffled in mist. Brian&#x2019;s yard was already off the grid; now, I was completely off the map. Here, there be monsters. A beer that tastes like trees? This isn&#x2019;t beer ... is it?</p><p data-reactid=".gxjukqik1s.1.1.0.0.4.e"><em>William Bostwick is the author </em>of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Brewers-Tale-History-According/dp/0393239144">The Brewer&#x2019;s Tale: A History of the World According to Beer</a><em>, which comes out today.
