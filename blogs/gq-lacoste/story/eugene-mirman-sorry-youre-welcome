  	    "articleBody": "Eugene Mirman may be best known for his role on the cult animated series Bob\u0027s Burgers. He provides the enthusiastic and eminently quotable voice of Gene Belcher, an 11-year-old with a surrealist worldview and an unquenchable enthusiasm for weird schemes—two qualities that the character and the actor share.\u000A\u000AWhen he\u0027s not playing Gene, however, or any number of scene-stealing roles on shows like Archer and Flight of the Conchords, Mirman maintains a busy and impressively unpredictable schedule of projects that includes frequent standup gigs, his own eponymous comedy festival in Brooklyn, occasional co-hosting duties on Neil deGrasse Tyson\u0027s StarTalk podcast, and one of the most fascinatingly strange comedy careers of the new comedy boom.\u000A\u000AOn October 30, Sub Pop will release Mirman\u0027s latest comedy \u0022album\u0022 I\u0027m Sorry (You\u0027re Welcome), a nine-volume, seven-LP box set that includes a live standup recording along with a sound-effects library, a meditation album, and \u0022an erotic soundscape for lovebirds and adventurous friends\u0022 called \u0022Fuckscape.\u0022 It\u0027s available on vinyl, digitally, and in the form of a robe and midcentury-modern-inspired chair. (More on that later.)\u000A\u000ABefore its release, we got on the phone with Mirman to talk about all the weird things he gets up to.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AYour new box set seems to have come from an idea about how ridiculous a box set you could possibly make. At what point in the process of making it did it start feeling like work?In a sense, everything fun is always sort of work. To even get a joke to work, you try it so many times on stage and tweak it. Really, almost the whole time—from the beginning, when I recorded the crying. Recording 45 minutes of crying, which was a funny thing to say and a funny thing to have on a sticker on an album, was somewhat hard and really annoying. Especially with the idea that, you know, I don\u0027t think I would actually listen to it. I just think it\u0027s a funny thing to have on an album.\u000A\u000AHow challenging was it to actually record 45 minutes of crying? I guess the answer is \u0022moderately challenging.\u0022 I don\u0027t know. I obviously did it, but I guess it\u0027s sort of draining in its own way.\u000A\u000AYou reprinted some of the emails from the project in the liner notes. I\u0027m curious: At what point did it start seeming normal to use the word \u0022Fuckscape\u0022 regularly in work emails?[Laughs] You know, it\u0027s funny. When I first thought of it, I thought of it as being called \u0022Fuckscape,\u0022 but then I tried pretty hard to think of other names that would be as good but didn\u0027t have a swear in it and I just couldn\u0027t think of anything. I think once I said it… it\u0027s probably easier to say \u0022Fuckscape\u0022 than refer to \u002296 Orgasms.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe \u0022Digital Drugs\u0022 disc, that seems like a very obscure reference. It\u0027s based on binaural audio tracks, right?Yes. Basically at some point–and I don\u0027t know how I came across it–if you Google something like \u0022Channel 9 digital drugs danger\u0022 or something like that, you see this video that\u0027s from a news channel in Ohio that is all about how there\u0027s a new thing to fear and it\u0027s digital drugs. And then as I started reading about it I saw that it was banned in some countries, and I thought it was really funny. All the \u0022Digital Drugs\u0022 tracks have a binaural beat with other stuff on top of them. It is the thing that it\u0027s making fun of. It is the thing that people think will alter your mind.\u000A\u000ADid you actually try any of the binaural recordings to see if they worked?I mean, I watched and listened to a bunch. I put headphones on and closed my eyes and, yeah, but I didn\u0027t convulse, like you see children do in [news] videos. I\u0027ve rarely seen a thing that\u0027s meant to scare people more that\u0027s just not scary. I also do think it\u0027s funny to satirize a thing that people are only moderately aware of.\u000A\u000A\u0022You have to do the thing. It\u0027s funnier to have 45 minutes of crying than to just say there\u0027s 45 minutes of crying.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000AAre you the type of person who likes going down weird Wikipedia rabbit holes?Yes. Absolutely. Even for the bits I do, I often do a crazy amount of reading about some random thing and all of a sudden some idea that makes sense comes to me.\u000A\u000AThe meditation disc seems pretty accurately done. Have you listened to a lot of meditation tapes?I did for that, and also in general I\u0027d just come across them. I also really wanted to make something that was ridiculous but also kind of relaxing. There\u0027s never any time where I\u0027m shouting or doing anything jarring. Excluding the things that I\u0027m saying. It goes back to wanting to make something that is also the thing it\u0027s making fun of.\u000A\u000AHow about \u0022195 Orgasms\u0022?That, I was just sort of thinking, what is the most ridiculous thing you can put on an album? And that was recording and titling \u0022195 Orgasms.\u0022 I think the orgasms and the crying are sort of similar, in the sense that I think of it as a thing that the idea of putting a sticker on something that says \u0022Featuring 195 orgasms and over 45 minutes of crying!\u0022 as if it\u0027s the thing that people wanted the most and I\u0027m finally like \u0022Here it is!\u0022 But the thing is, to make those jokes, to me, you have to do the thing. I think it\u0027s much funnier to have 45 minutes of crying than to just say there\u0027s 45 minutes of crying.\u000A\u000AI also like the idea that there are people who are going to approach this box set very invested in it, and they\u0027re going to listen to all 195 orgasms in a row.They might! We tried to make it so that if you did do that, you\u0027d sort of laugh throughout. But we\u0027ll find out if that worked.\u000A\u000AThe box set comes in vinyl format, but it also comes as a robe and a chair. How does that work?The chair actually has built-in speakers and an MP3 player with the album pre-loaded. And then the robe has an MP3 player sewn into a pocket with the album cover embroidered on the back.\u000A\u000AThat sounds fancy.It\u0027s moderately fancy.\u000A\u000AFrom a certain angle, your career kind of seems like it\u0027s based on you seeing what you can get away with. Is that true?It\u0027s funny. I guess it depends how you look at it. I look at it as, \u0022What is a fun thing that I can realistically do?\u0022 And then I guess another way of phrasing that is, \u0022What can I get away with?\u0022 But a lot of it is that it has to be fun for me—the process and the execution.\u000A\u000AAre there any concepts that you haven\u0027t been able to pull off?With this I had vaguely considered making a 100-disc thing. I never even considered doing it because it just seemed too insane, and it seemed too unfillable with things that are funny. Because even this album, it has one or two things that are sort of a joke concept, and there\u0027s other stuff that I tried to make that you could listen to and enjoy. For the festival we\u0027ve often thought of creating some sort of ice-cream limousine bus. I don\u0027t really know how to do that, and we never have, but is it possible to one day do something like that? I don\u0027t know. Maybe.",

all in service of his new comedy album, which is available on vinyl, on MP3, and in both chair and embroidered-robe form.</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.0">Eugene Mirman may be best known for his role on the cult animated series <em>Bob&#x2019;s Burgers</em>. He provides the enthusiastic and eminently quotable voice of Gene Belcher, an 11-year-old with a surrealist worldview and an unquenchable enthusiasm for weird schemes&#x2014;two qualities that the character and the actor share.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.1">When he&#x2019;s not playing Gene, however, or any number of scene-stealing roles on shows like <em>Archer</em> and <em>Flight of the Conchords</em>, Mirman maintains a busy and impressively unpredictable schedule of projects that includes frequent standup gigs, his own eponymous comedy festival in Brooklyn, occasional co-hosting duties on Neil deGrasse Tyson&#x2019;s StarTalk podcast, and one of the most <a href="https://youtu.be/VMBCGUHEgH4">fascinatingly strange</a> comedy careers of the new comedy boom.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.2">On October 30, Sub Pop will release Mirman&#x2019;s latest comedy &#x201C;album&#x201D; <em>I&#x2019;m Sorry (You&#x2019;re Welcome)</em>, a nine-volume, seven-LP box set that includes a live standup recording along with a sound-effects library, a meditation album, and &#x201C;an erotic soundscape for lovebirds and adventurous friends&#x201D; called &#x201C;Fuckscape.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s available on vinyl, digitally, and in the form of a robe and midcentury-modern-inspired chair. (More on that later.)</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.3">Before its release, we got on the phone with Mirman to talk about all the weird things he gets up to.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.5"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Your new box set seems to have come from an idea about how ridiculous a box set you could possibly make. At what point in the process of making it did it start feeling like work?</strong><br>In a sense, everything fun is always sort of work. To even get a joke to work, you try it so many times on stage and tweak it. Really, almost the whole time&#x2014;from the beginning, when I recorded the crying. Recording 45 minutes of crying, which was a funny thing to say and a funny thing to have on a sticker on an album, was somewhat hard and really annoying. Especially with the idea that, you know, I don&#x2019;t think I would actually listen to it. I just think it&#x2019;s a funny thing to have on an album.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>How challenging was it to actually record 45 minutes of crying? </strong><br>I guess the answer is &#x201C;moderately challenging.&#x201D; I don&#x2019;t know. I obviously did it, but I guess it&#x2019;s sort of draining in its own way.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>You reprinted some of the emails from the project in the liner notes. I&#x2019;m curious: At what point did it start seeming normal to use the word &#x201C;Fuckscape&#x201D; regularly in work emails?</strong><br>[<em>Laughs</em>] You know, it&#x2019;s funny. When I first thought of it, I thought of it as being called &#x201C;Fuckscape,&#x201D; but then I tried pretty hard to think of other names that would be as good but didn&#x2019;t have a swear in it and I just couldn&#x2019;t think of anything. I think once I said it&#x2026; it&#x2019;s probably easier to say &#x201C;Fuckscape&#x201D; than refer to &#x201C;96 Orgasms.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>The &#x201C;Digital Drugs&#x201D; disc, that seems like a very obscure reference. It&#x2019;s based on</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/tU3oAyin8W4"><strong>binaural audio tracks</strong></a><strong>, right?</strong><br>Yes. Basically at some point&#x2013;and I don&#x2019;t know how I came across it&#x2013;if you Google something like <a href="http://www.news9.com/story/12793977/teens-now-getting-high-off-digital-drugs">&#x201C;Channel 9 digital drugs danger&#x201D;</a> or something like that, you see this video that&#x2019;s from a news channel in Ohio that is all about how there&#x2019;s a new thing to fear and it&#x2019;s digital drugs. And then as I started reading about it I saw that it was banned in some countries, and I thought it was really funny. All the &#x201C;Digital Drugs&#x201D; tracks have a binaural beat with other stuff on top of them. It is the thing that it&#x2019;s making fun of. It is the thing that people think will alter your mind.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Did you actually try any of the binaural recordings to see if they worked?</strong><br>I mean, I watched and listened to a bunch. I put headphones on and closed my eyes and, yeah, but I didn&#x2019;t convulse, like you see children do in [news] videos. I&#x2019;ve rarely seen a thing that&#x2019;s meant to scare people more that&#x2019;s just not scary. I also do think it&#x2019;s funny to satirize a thing that people are only moderately aware of.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.b"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&quot;You have to do the thing.

Absolutely. Even for the bits I do, I often do a crazy amount of reading about some random thing and all of a sudden some idea that makes sense comes to me.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>The meditation disc seems pretty accurately done. Have you listened to a lot of meditation tapes?</strong><br>I did for that, and also in general I&#x2019;d just come across them. I also really wanted to make something that was ridiculous but also kind of relaxing. There&#x2019;s never any time where I&#x2019;m shouting or doing anything jarring. Excluding the things that I&#x2019;m saying. It goes back to wanting to make something that is also the thing it&#x2019;s making fun of.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>How about &#x201C;195 Orgasms&#x201D;?</strong><br>That, I was just sort of thinking, what is the most ridiculous thing you can put on an album? And that was recording and titling &#x201C;195 Orgasms.&#x201D; I think the orgasms and the crying are sort of similar, in the sense that I think of it as a thing that the idea of putting a sticker on something that says &#x201C;Featuring 195 orgasms and over 45 minutes of crying!&#x201D; as if it&#x2019;s the thing that people wanted the most and I&#x2019;m finally like &#x201C;Here it is!&#x201D; But the thing is, to make those jokes, to me, you have to do the thing. I think it&#x2019;s much funnier to have 45 minutes of crying than to just say there&#x2019;s 45 minutes of crying.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>I also like the idea that there are people who are going to approach this box set very invested in it, and they&#x2019;re going to listen to all 195 orgasms in a row.</strong><br>They might! We tried to make it so that if you did do that, you&#x2019;d sort of laugh throughout. But we&#x2019;ll find out if that worked.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>The box set comes in vinyl format, but it also comes as a robe and a chair. How does that work?</strong><br>The chair actually has built-in speakers and an MP3 player with the album pre-loaded. And then the robe has an MP3 player sewn into a pocket with the album cover embroidered on the back.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>That sounds fancy.</strong><br>It&#x2019;s moderately fancy.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>From a certain angle, your career kind of seems like it&#x2019;s based on you seeing what you can get away with. Is that true?</strong><br>It&#x2019;s funny. I guess it depends how you look at it. I look at it as, &#x201C;What is a fun thing that I can realistically do?&#x201D; And then I guess another way of phrasing that is, &#x201C;What can I get away with?&#x201D; But a lot of it is that it has to be fun for me&#x2014;the process and the execution.</p><p data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>Are there any concepts that you haven&#x2019;t been able to pull off?</strong><br>With this I had vaguely considered making a 100-disc thing. I never even considered doing it because it just seemed too insane, and it seemed too unfillable with things that are funny. Because even this album, it has one or two things that are sort of a joke concept, and there&#x2019;s other stuff that I tried to make that you could listen to and enjoy. For the festival we&#x2019;ve often thought of creating some sort of ice-cream limousine bus. I don&#x2019;t really know how to do that, and we never have, but is it possible to one day do something like that? I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".26vq58hpszk.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
