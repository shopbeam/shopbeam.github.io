  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A It seemed like a good idea at the time: Strap into a seat at one of the nation\u0027s participating AMC theaters and watch Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger, all as a warm-up for the midnight premiere of The Avengers. And I wasn\u0027t the only one with that idea: The Marvel Movie Marathon, as it was so inventively dubbed, sold out in many U.S. cities months ago.\u000A\u000A What was it like to spend half a day sitting in a dark theater watching men cavort in spangly suits, praying your spine doesn\u0027t fuse? Read on.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A 11:20 a.m.\u000A\u000A After sitting in two hours of traffic to get into Manhattan, I am finally in my seat. I am not sitting next to someone dressed as the Hulk, nor am I behind a Loki with the big-ass helmet, so it\u0027s a win. In an effort to eat relatively healthily, I\u0027ve brought a protein bar with me. Let\u0027s see how long I can last without taking advantage of the parade of tan foods at the theater\u0027s concession.\u000A\u000A 11:34 a.m.\u000A\u000A Clark Gregg\u0027s Agent Phil Coulson introduces the first film, Iron Man (and will perform the same duty for the rest of the movies), in a specially filmed segment. It\u0027s a 12-hour S.H.I.E.L.D. debrief on the Avengers Initiative. Nice touch, Marvel.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A 11:35 a.m.\u000A\u000A Iron Man: This movie succeeds purely through force of will. Robert Downey Jr.\u0027s will, to be precise. He\u0027s so much fun to watch, and having such a good time doing it, you almost forget that the middle of the film has no antagonist: The second act is, essentially, a one-act play about a dude tinkering in his garage.\u000A\u000A 1:45 p.m.\u000A\u000A Iron Man\u0027s done and I stretch my legs to look around. The crowd is surprisingly diverse. Granted, we\u0027re in N.Y.C., so that throws off the curve a bit, but there are a lot of colors and creeds here—black, white, Asian, Hispanic—as well as women. Attractive women. In tight superhero T-shirts. (I\u0027m a married spud, I\u0027m a married spud, I\u0027m a married spud...)\u000A\u000A 1:55 p.m.\u000A\u000A By the dull metallic thud I hear from two seats over, it\u0027s clear someone either brought a handful of aluminum sex toys or he snuck in a six-pack. Either way, this man will be my new best friend.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A 2:00 p.m.\u000A\u000A The Incredible Hulk: It\u0027s the 2008 version, with Ed Norton and Liv Tyler. Which is still better than Ang Lee\u0027s 2003 whatever-the-hell-that-was, though not by all that much. The Hulk is actually pretty sweet—the green monster might as well be the poster giant for special-effects advancement. But you never once, for a second, buy Tim Roth as the toughest hombre in the military. Because it\u0027s Tim Roth with CG muscles. Also, Liv Tyler is the worst actress ever. No, really. Ever. \u000A\u000A 2:10 p.m.\u000A\u000A I eat my one protein bar. It does not distract me from the smells of nachos wafting through the air. I will kill the next person who walks past me with nachos and claim them for my prize.\u000A\u000A 3:30 p.m.\u000A\u000A I wake up to find I\u0027ve been napping for 20 minutes. This can happen when two computer-generated monsters are throwing computer-generated punches at each other set against the Harlem street they built somewhere in Canada.\u000A\u000A 4:03 p.m.\u000A\u000A You know in The Amazing Race, when the teams have to squeeze onto those insanely crowded trains in Calcutta and the blonde girls—there is always a team of blonde girls—are thoroughly disgusted by the smells and the touching and the goats? That\u0027s what the men\u0027s room is like.\u000A\u000A 4:15 p.m.\u000A\u000A I change theaters. A buddy of mine texted me that he had an empty seat next to him in one of the AMC\u0027s other two theaters running the Marathon, and it\u0027s right smack in the middle of the room. Which, if you\u0027re a dork like me, counts for a lot. This is where I will work my ass groove into the seat to prove I was here. Like planting a flag on the moon, but with your ass.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A 4:20 p.m.\u000A\u000A Iron Man 2: Which is, basically, Iron Man 1 without the new-car smell. Begins with a wanton show of excess and ego on the part of our hero, mis in a villain who is simply a funhouse-mirror version of Tony Stark—a brilliant man living in the shadow of a domineering father—and another vast middle chunk in which Tony hangs out in his workshop building shit. I did forget how great of an entrance Scarlett Johansson makes as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and how Looney-Tunes Mickey Rourke is as Ivan Vanko. And any movie that lets Sam Rockwell dance can never be totally irredeemable. Still, even Downey Jr.\u0027s super-heroic charisma can\u0027t really save this sequel.\u000A\u000A 6:30 p.m.\u000A\u000A My knees are killing me because I am an old man who, apparently, can\u0027t have his legs bent for hours at a time. I leave the theater for a quick walk. Also, that 250-calorie protein bar ain\u0027t cutting it.\u000A\u000A 6:40 p.m.\u000A\u000A McDonald\u0027s. Hey, at least they put lettuce on some stuff.\u000A\u000A 7:00 p.m.\u000A\u000A Fat Tony Stark is regaling the crowd—or, at least the three people sitting around him. I call him Fat Tony Stark because, a) he\u0027s rotund, and b) he\u0027s proudly wearing a Stark-designed chest plate—a light-up one that he built himself for less than four bucks—under his JCPenney dress shirt. He\u0027s giving a rather accurate summation of the Neil Gaiman/Todd McFarlane legal feud over comic book shit that you don\u0027t care about.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A 7:10 p.m.\u000A\u000A Thor: An excellent bounce-back from the tepid Iron Man 2. Thor can feel a little stagey—which, given that it was directed by Kenneth Branagh and has a total of four locations, makes sense—but there is real drama at work. Two brothers, both damaged, willing to destroy worlds in order to earn their father\u0027s love. Natalie Portman does something with the hot scientist role, Tom Hiddleston chews every line of dialogue like he\u0027s trying to blow the universe\u0027s best speech bubble, and Chris Hemsworth is every inch the god of thunder.\u000A\u000A 9:00 p.m.\u000A\u000A I can\u0027t feel my legs.\u000A\u000A 9:01 p.m.\u000A\u000A Maybe McDonald\u0027s wasn\u0027t the best idea.\u000A\u000A 9:10 p.m.\u000A\u000A The theater manager popped in to tell us that they\u0027re planning more marathons like these. They want to do a Lord of the Rings marathon before The Hobbit comes out, a Christopher Nolan Batman-athon and, yes, a Twilight-athon. You\u0027ve never heard a theater go from cheers to blood-curdling threats so quickly.\u000A\u000A 9:13 p.m.\u000A\u000A Lionel Ritchie\u0027s \u0022Say You (Say Me)\u0022 is playing over the PA system. For the ninth time. Because this is a crowd that loves \u002780s soundtrack power ballads. Also, Fat Tony Stark is lecturing again, this time about why The Walking Dead #1 is a valuable comic book. Thank goodness.\u000A\u000A 9:20 p.m.\u000A\u000A Zaftig Female Loki is on line to buy popcorn. Really, she\u0027s kitted out with giant gold horns, staff of power, the whole magilla. Also, in no way am I using \u0022zaftig\u0022 pejoratively. This girl is working it. And I have succumbed to popcorn.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A 9:25 p.m.\u000A\u000A Captain America: The First Avenger: The first 40 minutes of this movie might be the best first-40 of any Marvel flick. The earnestness with which it charts Steve Roger\u0027s journey from wimp to stud is remarkable—there is no irony present. This is a movie about a hero who was a hero before he got the muscles and the uniform and Captain America plays it absolutely, patriotically straight.\u000A\u000A 11:40 p.m.\u000A\u000A This theater smells like a compact car after a week-long road trip through the south with four dudes who love Tex-Mex. If you could take a theater out back and shoot it, I would.\u000A\u000A 11:45 p.m.\u000A\u000A My coccyx feels like it\u0027s been kicked in the nuts. I can\u0027t feel my shins. Some yahoo next to be is talking about the relative virtues of organic webs versus web shooters. I\u0027m too damned punchy for Spider-Man. Must focus.\u000A\u000A 12:01 a.m.\u000A\u000A The Avengers: There are other places to read reviews of this one, including GQ\u0027s very own Tom Carson. But as a geek, as a fan, as a dude who risked permanent spinal damage to sit here for 12 hours to see it at midnight, The Avengers gave me everything I wanted. It is not deep, but it did not aim for depth. It aimed for awesome.\u000A\u000A 2:37 a.m.\u000A\u000AWe\u0027re done. Hot damn. I can barely walk, my eyes are filmy, and my spine is, indeed, fused...but I am sated. Because for all the unfortunate sights, and even more unfortunate smells, there is nothing quite like seeing a movie with other people willing to sacrifice bodily health to do so.\u000A\u000A 11:04 a.m.\u000A\u000A I miss my ass groove.",

The earnestness with which it charts Steve Roger&#x2019;s journey from wimp to stud is remarkable&#x2014;there is no irony present. This is a movie about a hero who was a hero before he got the muscles and the uniform and <em>Captain America</em> plays it absolutely, patriotically straight.</p><p data-reactid=".l69ri33pq8.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> <strong>11:40 p.m.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".l69ri33pq8.1.1.0.0.4.1h"> This theater smells like a compact car after a week-long road trip through the south with four dudes who love Tex-Mex.
