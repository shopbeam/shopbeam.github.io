  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI hate the New York Mets; as a native Atlantan, this virulence was bred into me. Yet I must also admit that, as a 14-year resident of New York City, I often find myself settling down and tuning into SNY on summer nights to watch the Mets broadcasts—not for the team, but for analyst Keith Hernandez.\u000A\u000AAs a player, Hernandez was named National League co-MVP in 1979, and won two World Series titles (one with the Cardinals in \u002782, one with the Mets in \u002786). He was just as dynamic off the field, a man about Manhattan, making a GQ cover appearance as well turning in a brilliant cameo on Seinfeld.\u000A\u000AThese days, as a Mets announcer alongside Gary Cohen and Ron Darling, Hernandez breezily mis humor and baseball expertise, chatting amiably about everything from pitch counts to weekends in the Hamptons. You don\u0027t have to like the Mets, but Hernandez makes the Mets\u0027 broadcasts nearly irresistible.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: You have a knack for telling stories and analyzing the game. Did broadcasting come easy for you?\u000A\u000A Keith Hernandez: The stories are just things that go on and have gone on in my life in the past, my life and baseball and other things—those are all just memory and relaying the story. There\u0027s games that you have to entertain: not every game is a 1-0 game or 2-1 game; there\u0027s a lot of games that are, like, 8-0, and those are the games you have to work at it and try to hold the viewer, so you get into storytelling. Gary Cohen, SNY broadcaster really orchestrates as the game goes on, and gets us telling stories and gets us back on the game if it gets to be too much. He\u0027s the real professional. He went to school and did all the minor league stuff to become a play-by-play guy. As the analyst, I just talk about what I see and give my opinions as the game progresses. And I know the game, so it\u0027s easy for me.\u000A\u000AI was watching a game one night and you told a great story about when you were playing minor league ball in Tulsa and a tornado came through town.\u000A\u000A The storms always go to the northeast, evidently, from the southwest to the northeast. So it had hit Oklahoma City in the morning, and Tulsa was northeast, two hours, so it was coming. We got phone calls in the morning that the game was canceled, and I was at an apartment complex with a lot of young people, and we just played volleyball in the pool all day. It was extremely hot and humid. Then around 4 o\u0027clock, the front came, a pea green cloud—you could\u0027ve cut a line on the cloud with a scalpel. And it was over our heads before you knew it and everybody was scrambling. I wound up going into a ditch just off the parking lot. Within five minutes I was waist-deep in water, and the trees were swaying, and I thought, Oh my God, if a tree falls I\u0027m going to drown. So I climbed out and went back into my apartment, blah blah blah, and the next day I had poison oak from head to toe. That ditch was full of poison oak. We had to bus to Omaha to play the Omaha Royals the next day, and I was head-to-toe poison oak the whole bus ride. The doctor gave me cortisone shots when I got into Omaha, and it was 105 degrees. And I played the game, with all that poison oak everywhere. That\u0027s the story. I don\u0027t ever want to be a part of a tornado ever again.\u000A\u000AYou were traded from the Cardinals to the Mets in 1983. What was New York City like back then?\u000A\u000A New York was always a city that kind of intimidated me when I was with the Cardinals. You know, I played games in New York in the &amp;#x2018;70s, when the city was kind of financially in trouble and it went bankrupt or whatever, and it wasn\u0027t a real pleasant place to be. But in the &amp;#x2018;80s it turned around. A lot of it had to do with Mayor Koch, who got the ball rolling, and obviously Giuliani came in and just completely turned the city around. We were winning; it was great; it was a great place to be. Rusty Staub told me to live in the city and that was probably the greatest decision I made. It was a completely foreign lifestyle for me. I\u0027d never lived in an urban area, and certainly what greater urban area than New York City? I didn\u0027t ease into it, so to speak. I made friends, and it was just a great place. I just had a wonderful time.\u000A\u000AWhen you played, and even now, you\u0027ve always seemed to give attention to the way you were dressed off the field.\u000A\u000A Actually, I was a cover of GQ, you know, in the &amp;#x2018;80s. I was a cover when Miami Vice was a big hit—they had me in a Miami Vice outfit, a Don Johnson look. There were some places where you went out and you couldn\u0027t wear jeans, you had to dress up, so I got much more fashion conscious when I got settled in New York and I was going out. But I think basically I\u0027m not a trendy dresser. I always like classic-looking suits, because I think they\u0027ll never go out of style. It was instilled in me by father not to go with what the fad is. When goatees came in, I never grew a goatee—I actually had a goatee once, way before everyone started growing them. When you get older you become a little more conservative, too. I actually love to wear wingtips now, believe it or not. I hated them when I was in high school, absolutely hated them, but there are some beautiful-looking wingtips out there, absolutely gorgeous. So I\u0027ve become more conservative in my dressing as I\u0027ve gotten older. I have to wear suits on the air; I like to look nice on the air so I like to wear nice suits.\u000A\u000AWell, I think wingtips are in now.\u000A\u000A Are they in? I did not know that. I think they\u0027re great looking. When we were kids we used to call them clodhoppers in Northern California. But there\u0027s a store on Madison Avenue, gosh, that\u0027s just got some beautiful wingtips. Just great looking wingtips. Actually, I just bought a new pair of brown ones. I needed a pair of brown, so...\u000A\u000AYou mentioned the goatee. The mustache is now trendy in some circles. How does it feel to be a mustache icon?\u000A\u000A It doesn\u0027t make any difference to me, one way or the other. I mean, I haven\u0027t got the mustache anymore. The mustache is gone and it\u0027ll be gone forever. I\u0027m not going to grow it back.\u000A\u000AWhat kind of hope can you give Mets fans for the future of the team?\u000A\u000A Mets fans have always been proud, patient, and they\u0027ve gone through this before. In the history of the Mets there\u0027s been more downside than upside but, they\u0027ve got some good young arms, and they just need to get some bats now and we\u0027ll see what happens. Rome wasn\u0027t built in a day. Even in the &amp;#x2018;80s, which was probably the most successful period in Met history, it just didn\u0027t happen overnight. Just hang in there.\u000A\u000ADo you worry at all about the future of baseball and its popularity with younger fans?\u000A\u000A I do, I do worry about it to a degree. I worry about the length of the games. They\u0027re way too long in my opinion; it\u0027s hard to hold the viewer. I worry about expansion; they expanded too quick and diluted the talent base. It\u0027s a great game. It\u0027s a game that &amp;#x2018;s every day—it\u0027s not like football where it\u0027s once a week, or basketball and hockey where they play three or four times a week. Baseball\u0027s every day for six months, and there are some bad teams out there. A lot of bad product out there. But I worry most specifically in those two areas: the length of the game and expanding too much. And that\u0027s not going to change; there\u0027s not enough talent to go around to all thirty teams.\u000A\u000AOne more thing, about those guest spots on Seinfeld: Was Julia Louis-Dreyfus a good kisser?\u000A\u000A Oh, there was no romantic kissing on that. She was three months pregnant with her first child when we filmed that. Her husband, a wonderful guy, was on the set. We had to do eight takes, but there was nothing romantic. She had soft lips, though.",

Mets; as a native Atlantan, this virulence was bred into me. Yet I must also admit that, as a 14-year resident of New York City, I often find myself settling down and tuning into SNY on summer nights to watch the Mets broadcasts&#x2014;not for the team, but for analyst Keith Hernandez.</p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.2">As a player, Hernandez was named National League co-MVP in 1979, and won two World Series titles (one with the Cardinals in &#x2019;82, one with the Mets in &#x2019;86). He was just as dynamic off the field, a man about Manhattan, making a <em>GQ</em> cover appearance as well turning in a brilliant cameo on <em>Seinfeld</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.3">These days, as a Mets announcer alongside Gary Cohen and Ron Darling, Hernandez breezily mis humor and baseball expertise, chatting amiably about everything from pitch counts to weekends in the Hamptons. You don&#x2019;t have to like the Mets, but Hernandez makes the Mets&#x2019; broadcasts nearly irresistible.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.5"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>GQ: You have a knack for telling stories and analyzing the game. Did broadcasting come easy for you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong> </strong><strong>Keith Hernandez:</strong> The stories are just things that go on and have gone on in my life in the past, my life and baseball and other things&#x2014;those are all just memory and relaying the story. There&#x2019;s games that you have to entertain: not every game is a 1-0 game or 2-1 game; there&#x2019;s a lot of games that are, like, 8-0, and those are the games you have to work at it and try to hold the viewer, so you get into storytelling. Gary Cohen, SNY broadcaster really orchestrates as the game goes on, and gets us telling stories and gets us back on the game if it gets to be too much. He&#x2019;s the real professional. He went to school and did all the minor league stuff to become a play-by-play guy. As the analyst, I just talk about what I see and give my opinions as the game progresses. And I know the game, so it&#x2019;s easy for me.</p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>I was watching a game one night and you told a great story about when you were playing minor league ball in Tulsa and a tornado came through town.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong> </strong>The storms always go to the northeast, evidently, from the southwest to the northeast. So it had hit Oklahoma City in the morning, and Tulsa was northeast, two hours, so it was coming. We got phone calls in the morning that the game was canceled, and I was at an apartment complex with a lot of young people, and we just played volleyball in the pool all day. It was extremely hot and humid. Then around 4 o&#x2019;clock, the front came, a pea green cloud&#x2014;you could&#x2019;ve cut a line on the cloud with a scalpel. And it was over our heads before you knew it and everybody was scrambling. I wound up going into a ditch just off the parking lot. Within five minutes I was waist-deep in water, and the trees were swaying, and I thought, <em>Oh my God, if a tree falls I&#x2019;m going to drown</em>. So I climbed out and went back into my apartment, blah blah blah, and the next day I had poison oak from head to toe. That ditch was full of poison oak. We had to bus to Omaha to play the Omaha Royals the next day, and I was head-to-toe poison oak the whole bus ride. The doctor gave me cortisone shots when I got into Omaha, and it was 105 degrees. And I played the game, with all that poison oak everywhere. That&#x2019;s the story. I don&#x2019;t ever want to be a part of a tornado ever again.</p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>You were traded from the Cardinals to the Mets in 1983. What was New York City like back then?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong> </strong>New York was always a city that kind of intimidated me when I was with the Cardinals. You know, I played games in New York in the &amp;#x2018;70s, when the city was kind of financially in trouble and it went bankrupt or whatever, and it wasn&#x2019;t a real pleasant place to be. But in the &amp;#x2018;80s it turned around. A lot of it had to do with Mayor Koch, who got the ball rolling, and obviously Giuliani came in and just completely turned the city around. We were winning; it was great; it was a great place to be. Rusty Staub told me to live in the city and that was probably the greatest decision I made. It was a completely foreign lifestyle for me. I&#x2019;d never lived in an urban area, and certainly what greater urban area than New York City? I didn&#x2019;t ease into it, so to speak. I made friends, and it was just a great place. I just had a wonderful time.</p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>When you played, and even now, you&#x2019;ve always seemed to give attention to the way you were dressed off the field.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong> </strong>Actually, I was a cover of <em>GQ</em>, you know, in the &amp;#x2018;80s. I was a cover when <em>Miami Vice</em> was a big hit&#x2014;they had me in a <em>Miami Vice</em> outfit, a Don Johnson look. There were some places where you went out and you couldn&#x2019;t wear jeans, you had to dress up, so I got much more fashion conscious when I got settled in New York and I was going out. But I think basically I&#x2019;m not a trendy dresser. I always like classic-looking suits, because I think they&#x2019;ll never go out of style. It was instilled in me by father not to go with what the fad is. When goatees came in, I never grew a goatee&#x2014;I actually had a goatee once, way before everyone started growing them. When you get older you become a little more conservative, too. I actually love to wear wingtips now, believe it or not. I hated them when I was in high school, absolutely hated them, but there are some beautiful-looking wingtips out there, absolutely gorgeous. So I&#x2019;ve become more conservative in my dressing as I&#x2019;ve gotten older. I have to wear suits on the air; I like to look nice on the air so I like to wear nice suits.</p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Well, I think wingtips are in now.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong> </strong>Are they in? I did not know that. I think they&#x2019;re great looking. When we were kids we used to call them clodhoppers in Northern California. But there&#x2019;s a store on Madison Avenue, gosh, that&#x2019;s just got some beautiful wingtips. Just great looking wingtips. Actually, I just bought a new pair of brown ones. I needed a pair of brown, so...</p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>You mentioned the goatee. The mustache is now trendy in some circles. How does it feel to be a mustache icon?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong> </strong>It doesn&#x2019;t make any difference to me, one way or the other. I mean, I haven&#x2019;t got the mustache anymore. The mustache is gone and it&#x2019;ll be gone forever. I&#x2019;m not going to grow it back.</p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>What kind of hope can you give Mets fans for the future of the team?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong> </strong>Mets fans have always been proud, patient, and they&#x2019;ve gone through this before. In the history of the Mets there&#x2019;s been more downside than upside but, they&#x2019;ve got some good young arms, and they just need to get some bats now and we&#x2019;ll see what happens. Rome wasn&#x2019;t built in a day. Even in the &amp;#x2018;80s, which was probably the most successful period in Met history, it just didn&#x2019;t happen overnight. Just hang in there.</p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Do you worry at all about the future of baseball and its popularity with younger fans?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong> </strong>I do, I do worry about it to a degree. I worry about the length of the games. They&#x2019;re way too long in my opinion; it&#x2019;s hard to hold the viewer. I worry about expansion; they expanded too quick and diluted the talent base. It&#x2019;s a great game. It&#x2019;s a game that &amp;#x2018;s every day&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not like football where it&#x2019;s once a week, or basketball and hockey where they play three or four times a week. Baseball&#x2019;s every day for six months, and there are some bad teams out there. A lot of bad product out there. But I worry most specifically in those two areas: the length of the game and expanding too much. And that&#x2019;s not going to change; there&#x2019;s not enough talent to go around to all thirty teams.</p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>One more thing, about those guest spots on <em>Seinfeld</em>: Was <a href="http://www.gq.com/women/photos/201405/julia-louis-dreyfuss-gq-photos">Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a> a good kisser?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.4.n"> Oh, there was no romantic kissing on that. She was three months pregnant with her first child when we filmed that. Her husband, a wonderful guy, was on the set. We had to do eight takes, but there was nothing romantic. She had soft lips, though.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".93bo6k39q8.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
