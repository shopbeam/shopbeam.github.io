  	    "articleBody": "Before I get into my full notebook dump from this month\u0027s big story about Motley Crue\u0027s final tour, I have a couple of suggestions for all you hair-metal newbies out there. First off, if you\u0027d like to learn more about Motley, specifically more about how many drugs they took and women they slept with, I urge you to read The Dirt, the autobiography they co-wrote with Neil Strauss. It remains the finest book about music ever written (I have read no other books about music, but remain confident of the assertion).\u000A\u000AAlso, if you\u0027re gonna go see Motley on this farewell tour (GO!), make sure you see them in an indoor arena. I saw the band inside in Austin and outside in Dallas and the sound inside was way better. When I stood at the back of the Dallas pavilion with all the drunks and stoner burnouts, all you could hear were the backing tracks. I\u0027ve got nothing against backing trackspretty much every artist on Earth uses them nowbut the mix was better indoors. That Austin show was one of my favorite concert-going experiences ever. It\u0027s nice to see a band in a club, because you can see them up close, but there\u0027s something to be said for 20,000 metalheads in one room, screaming their heads off. I never got to see Motley when I was a kid. It was very much worth the wait.\u000A\u000APrepare yourself for one small quirk in the setlist, though: At both shows I attended, the first song was \u0022Saints of Los Angeles,\u0022 a latter day track that I didn\u0027t give a shit about. The rest of the set was pretty much all the kickass hits. But that opener was a weird choice.\u000A\u000AGot all that? Good. Now let\u0027s dive a little bit deeper into the gutter:\u000A\u000A* Nikki Sixx brings his dog, a golden retriever named Leica, on tour with him. Leica essentially serves as Nikki\u0027s therapy dog, to give him something to do on the road and keep his ass out of trouble: \u0022It\u0027s so easy out here to get disconnected from reality,\u0022 he told me. \u0022It\u0027s about sleep, rest, work, performance, sleep, rest, work, performance. And then, next thing you know, you\u0027ve been away from your house so long, it kind of takes you a second to get acclimated to reality. So he\u0027s a big part for me of being like, \u0027Hey, he\u0027s my dog. I\u0027ve got a responsibility.\u0027 It\u0027s really easy out here when you\u0027re in a band\u0027Hey, Nikki, can I get you a water, can I get you a drink, can I get you your food, what do you want after the show\u0027everyone walks you everywhere, you\u0027ve got security with you. It\u0027s like, fuck, I\u0027m not a person anymore! I\u0027m an adult! And I\u0027m not the road manager anymore; I\u0027m not the father; I\u0027m not in control of my life. You\u0027re kind of a box of soap.\u0022\u000A\u000A* Fans know all about Leica. At the Dallas show, I met two twenty-something girls in pancake makeup, both named Jenna, who were at the show specifically because they loved the dog and wanted to see it. (SPOILER: The dog is not in the show.) Here is my exchange with the two Jennas:\u000A\u000AJENNA 1: I just actually want to see the dog. Tell [Nikki] I love his dog. I tweeted about his dog and he favorited it, but he didn\u0027t reply so I was like, \u0022Damn.\u0022\u000A\u000AME: Do you also like the dog?\u000A\u000AJENNA 2: Yes. I love the dog. It\u0027s the cutest dog in the world.\u000A\u000AME: Do you love the music?\u000A\u000AJENNA 2: Oh, fuck no.\u000A\u000AJENNA 1: She doesn\u0027t.\u000A\u000A* Three months ago, Nikki went to get heart checked and he was honest on all his forms. He ticked off every drug he ever used (\u0022Everything was checked. It was amazing. Look at that! I made straight As!\u0022), and then the doctors asked if he had every had any heart problems.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, I was dead for two minutes, and they brought me back to life with two shots of adrenaline,\u0022 he told them (For those of you that may not know, this is a true story. Nikki overdosed on heroin and his heart stopped). Concerned, the doctors hooked him up with electrodes, placed him on a treadmill, and took an EKG.\u000A\u000A\u0022And they\u0027re showing the heart,\u0022 Nikki told me, \u0022And they\u0027re going, \u0027There\u0027s no scarring, and everything is working. Your heart is like a fucking 25-year-old.\u0027 And there was just a part of me, when I left, that was like, all right, I got to do all that, and I\u0027m still healthy. So FUCK YOU!\u0022\u000A\u000A* More fan mayhem: In Dallas, there was line of cars stretching out from the parking lot entrance prior to the start of the show. I was in a car with our photographer and his assistant, and we noticed that the traffic stretched over a section of Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) track. The pickup truck in front of us tried to sneak over the track and get closer to the entrance, but got stuck just as the train was approaching and the fucking crossing gate was coming down. And we watched in horror as the gate landed ON THE ROOF of the pickup and bounced off. I thought we were gonna watch the thing get smashed to pieces by the oncoming streetcar. But the train slowed and eventually there was enough space for the loon in the truck in front of us to move ahead. I\u0027ve never seen a railroad gate crash down onto a car. That is a tense moment.\u000A\u000A* Outside the back entrance of the arena, I was chilling with a bouncer guarding the loading dock prior to the show. He was trimming his fingernails with a hunting knife. At one point, two women in a car tried to park near the tour buses, even moving a traffic cone out of the way, and the guard got super pissed and angrily shooed them away. The driver had on a halter top that made her tits nearly touch her chin. I went up to her.\u000A\u000A\u0022Are you trying to get closer to the band?\u0022 I asked.\u000A\u000A\u0022Fuck the band!\u0022 she yelled. \u0022I don\u0027t want to walk that far.\u0022\u000A\u000A* Wanna be a roadie? Guess what? BEING A ROADIE SUCKS. For back-to-back shows in different towns, the average roadie has to get up at 5am to start unloading shit out of the buses, then they gotta spend all day assembling the stage, and then they have to wait until the show is over at midnight to break it all down, load it back into the buses, and then sleep in the back of a bus (Viggy showed me the beds in the back of one; the bus had ten little tiny bunks) for maybe four hours before you have to get up and do it all over again. Not much time for sex and drugs in that workday. It\u0027s a military operation and you cannot get in the way of it. When I was hanging out backstage, I was in the way of pretty much everything, and so my primary goal was to not get yelled at by anyone. I failed many times. There are bazillion people backstage and it\u0027s impossible to keep track of who the fuck is who between the roadies and managers and techs and tour people and band people and arena people and label people. The org chart probably looks like a spirograph.\u000A\u000A* At one point, to avoid being in the way, I went outside to the loading dock and hung out in the rain. And while I was standing there, this big black school bus rolls right up to the back door. I could see black lights and red velvet curtains decorating the inside. Motley\u0027s tour manager was NOT pleased. He went running up to the bus yelling, \u0022No no no no no!\u0022 And this one young guy gets off as a stream of wasted middle-aged people carrying Dos Equis bottles came storming out after him.\u000A\u000A\u0022What is this?\u0022 the tour manager asked.\u000A\u000A\u0022We\u0027re throwing my father-in-law a birthday party.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, you can\u0027t be here!\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd then I watched as all the drunkies piled back into the black bus and drove off to the regular parking lot. There\u0027s nothing better than drunk people who just say FUCK IT and try to go wherever they please. Speaking of which...\u000A\u000A* You might think a Motley Crue concert would be nothing but old guys, but you would be wrong. There were young people all over the joint. I saw plenty of teenagers who had discovered the band on their own. At the Dallas show, I met one shirtless kid (\u0022Where did your shirt go?\u0022 \u0022I was hot\u0022) whose three favorite bands were Opeth, Paramore, and Motley Crue, which had to be some kind of record for weirdest three favorite bands. I saw countless father-daughter combinations, including a dude named Greg who dressed up like Nikki and who was with his teenage daughter. \u0022Back about \u002781 or so,\u0022 he told me, \u0022I saw a picture, just of the album cover. I knew there was an attitude. I was turnedcan\u0027t say \u0027turned on\u0027but I was turned on to them right away, just by the look.\u0022\u000A\u000AI also saw tons of women: young, old, whatever. The women outnumbered the men at both shows. I was too intimidated to talk to some of the groupies. Even at 38 years old, I don\u0027t have the confidence to walk up to a woman in clingy dress and just start talking her up cold.\u000A\u000A* I also saw a dude wearing a shirt that said I SHAVED MY BALLS FOR THIS? I asked; he didn\u0027t.\u000A\u000A* I asked a bunch of people if they bought the whole \u0022last tour\u0022 spiel and their answers were mixed. One dude named Jason almost looked annoyed he had to shell out for the last show when he sure it wasn\u0027t going to be. \u0022Fuck off, we went to George Strait\u0027s supposed last show. They\u0027ll be back again. Child support payment\u0027s come due... Back taxes, come on.\u0022\u000A\u000A* I also met Big Silly, a four-hundred pound man wearing overalls and nothing else. Big Silly couldn\u0027t remember the last Motley concert he went to because he was tripping on acid at the time. \u0022All I remember is [Tommy] swirling on the drums.\u0022\u000A\u000A* This final tour is actually a variation on a show Motley staged during a residency at the Hard Rock casino in Vegas a while back. And when a rock concert stays in the same place forever, there\u0027s a whole lot more leeway as to what kind of pyrotechnics and shit the show can have. You don\u0027t have to deal with changing venues or dopey local ordinances. Viggy: \u0022When you tour, you have to be able to have it get torn down and go back out again. When you have something that\u0027s almost a permanent kind of show, it\u0027s a better show. To a degree.\u0022 So go to Vegas if your favorite band takes up residency there.\u000A\u000A* Viggy again: \u0022Metallica\u0027s the only band in the world that still shows up to the show in their Armani suits and goes and puts on the dungarees and black shirts. And then when they\u0027re done, they get back into their Armani suits and leave. I\u0027m like, \u0027Wait a minute, that\u0027s a little weird.\u0027 With [Motley], you barely can get them to shower.\u0022\u000A\u000A* When I asked Tommy if he had any regrets about his life and career, he brought up his parents, both of whom passed away in the new century. His mother died two years ago. His father died shortly after 9/11, which Tommy watched on TV while sitting at his deathbed. \u0022I\u0027m sitting there with my dad, he\u0027s fucking dying, and I noticed that, when people get older and they are in that position where they\u0027re about to check out, they start feeling helpless and regretting shitso if you ask me this question maybe 40 years from now or something, maybe I\u0027d have a different answer, but for now, fuck no. I\u0027ve done enough stuff to burn several brain cells. I\u0027ve got one left, and I\u0027m saving it for tomorrow.\u0022\u000A\u000AI remember you said that you were someone who had insecurities and craved recognition. Do you still feel that way? \u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, for sure. You want to fucking leave a mark here. You want to be known for certain things and have made a denta huge dentin this shit. Not just like, \u0027Oh, yeah, he was cool.\u0027 Fuck that, dude.\u0022\u000A\u000A* True story: Right after the show in Austin ended, one of the ladies next to me saw me jotting down shit in a notebook and asked me what I was doing. And when I explained to her that I was with GQ, she asked me who I\u0027d profiled in the past. I mentioned the Kid Rock cruise to her and her jaw dropped. \u0022I WAS ON THAT CRUISE!\u0022 she screamed. And then she started punching me. Like, hard! It really hurt. Turns out her best friends\u0027 tits were featured prominently in the photos accompanying that article. You can see said tits right here. Small world! The woman did not care for the foul language in the story.\u000A\u000A* I did NOT see any exposed breasts at either Motley show, by the way. Kid Rock wins on the exposed boob front.\u000A\u000A* After that woman punched me, I ran into another fan (drunk) and asked him what he thought of the show.\u000A\u000A\u0022They didn\u0027t play everything,\u0022 he complained.\u000A\u000A\u0022Really?\u0022 I asked. \u0022What didn\u0027t they play?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Shout at the Devil.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Yes they did!\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd the dude paused for a full minute and then was like... \u0022Oh yeah! They did!\u0022\u000A\u000A* I asked another guy what he thought of the show and he stuck his thumb sideways.\u000A\u000A\u0022Why not the full thumbs up?\u0022 I asked.\u000A\u000A\u0022Because I didn\u0027t get a handjob!\u0022\u000A\u000A* Want a t-shirt from the tour? That\u0027ll be $40. Beer was $12. BIG CONCESSION has you by the nuts when it comes to rock concerts. I bought a plastic Motley wristband for five bucks. It was the cheapest thing on the table, and I\u0027ve worn it ever since. I almost lost it a while back and freaked out because I had overpaid so dearly for it. Five bucks is still a decent amount of money to me.\u000A\u000A* I made the drive from Austin to Dallas and my friend who lives in the state told me that I had to stop by Waco along the way and hit up a joint called the Czech Stop. Apparently, Waco has an enormous Czech population, and everyone stops there on the way to Dallas to pick up a bunch of Czech pastries. It\u0027s the weirdest fucking shit I\u0027ve ever seen. When I think of Texas, I think of beef and guns and fake tits. It never occurred to me that you should go there to get a quality kolache.\u000A\u000A* With the exception of Vince, who wears jeans and flip flops when he\u0027s not on stage, the rest of the band dressed like rock stars during off hours: gun necklaces and braided wrist chains and rings and all that shit. And I gotta say, if you\u0027re in your fifties, you\u0027ll look a whole lot younger if you dress older. That\u0027s not a knock on the boys... just my opinion.\u000A\u000A* At the Austin VIP meet and greet, arena officials presented each member of the band with a commemorative gift basket, including all kinds of local hot sauces (Nice!). And in the receiving line, you could definitely see a few guys playing it cool, like they didn\u0027t want to look TOO starstruck around the band because it wouldn\u0027t look manly. Other guys didn\u0027t give a shit and would go running up to Nikki and Vince and Mick hooting and hollering. It was a highly amusing little dichotomy.\u000A\u000A* Viggy on Tommy Lee: \u0022Tommy Lee is the rock star\u0027s rock star. Slash and [former Stone Temple Pilot Scott]Weiland will be at the club and even they freak out when Tommy Lee shows up.\u0022\u000A\u000A* I was in the crowd in Dallas when a drunk girl grabbed me by the arm and leaned into me to whisper, \u0022Buy me a drink,\u0022 in my ear. And when she leaned over, she fell past me and toppled right into the aisle. An older man who came with her (the dad?) helped me get her back on her feet. I felt terrible. RAWK AND ROLL, AMERICA!\u000A\u000A* Fun fact: If you type Motley Crue into an iPhone, it adds the umlauts for you automatically. If I were in the band, I\u0027d be super proud of that fact.\u000A\u000A* Looking for a laser show during the farewell tour? I\u0027m sorry to say that you are shit out of luck. One guy backstage explained to me that you will rarely see lasers at rock concerts anymore due to safety concerns (NOTE: Lawyers ruin everything). \u0022Next time you see lasers at a show,\u0022 he said, \u0022see which way the lasers are pointing (at this point, he pointed up to the ceiling). Now in Europe, they don\u0027t give a shit.\u0022 So if you want some lasers shooting out into the crowd during a rock show, get your ass to Europe.\u000A\u000A* Time to hear from the band! Here\u0027s Mick Mars: \u0022I got on a plane to go back to Canada to record the rest of the John Corabi album\u0022the infamous self-titled 1994 album that the band recorded after temporarily firing Vince\u0022and I got booted off, because this onewhat do they call them nowadays? I always called them stewardesses. And she just got a hair up her butt because John came on and he hadwhat do you call it? A rainstick. And the lady goes, \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 And I said, \u0027It\u0027s a bong.\u0027 And she thought I said \u0027bomb.\u0027 So she had that hair in her up her butt. And she really didn\u0027t like me, and I was already tipsy, so I was being a little cocky. So, the plane takes off and the captain comes back and he goes, \u0027Hey, you need to calm down.\u0027 And, nope. The plane turned around and dropped me off. Turned all the way back. They\u0027d taken off; they circled LAX, came back, and landed. Booted me off.\u0022\u000A\u000A* Vince, on the band\u0027s success: \u0022We got really lucky when we started out; it was the beginning of MTV. It was the exact same year MTV started, \u002781, and so the videos really helped us along. You don\u0027t really do that for rock \u0027n\u0027 roll anymore, at all. And I think the timing was, like, coming out of punk in the \u002770s and the glam stuff, and we just kind of fit right in the middle of that, so it was all timing too. That\u0027s when L.A. was the hot-spot for bands, and we just happened to be there, so there was a lot of luck involved. There\u0027ll never be another scene like that again.\u0022\u000A\u000A* Financially speaking, Motley Crue will probably benefit from the death of rock and roll. Music is so divided now and has exploded into so many niche markets that a lot of the music from the \u002780s and \u002790s just increases in value every year because it always has a set audience of tens of millions of people, and that won\u0027t be the case for current artists as the audience gets progressively fragmented. There are maybe two or three BIG rock songs every year now, if that. Motley Crue has a dozen or more. That will be valuable to ad and movie people FOREVER. In retrospect, it\u0027s kind of amazing that the band can still consistently fill arenas despite not having a new hit in over two decades. That just how valuable some of these songs are.\u000A\u000A* Nikki, on coming back home after the \u0022Shout at the Devil:\u0022 tour: \u0022It was one of the most vacant times in my life, because you dream for this thing and you get it, and I remember getting it and then grabbing it by its throat and just ripping its throat out every nightjust fucking young and hungry and what\u0027s next and bigger, louder, just pushing the envelope, and a super creative high. And I remember getting dumped at my house, which was an apartment. So I went from living in an apartment I could barely fucking get by in, to coming back and being a multi-millionaire, and not having no friends, no girlfriend, no fucking life. I had two plants that I\u0027d gotten from some girls that were in my apartmentthey were dead. There was nothing else in there; I had a bowl, I had a spoon, I had a fork. I came home and I remember sitting in my front room like this, and I didn\u0027t really know what to do so I called Tommy. I go, \u0027What are you doing?\u0027 He goes, \u0027I\u0027m sitting here staring at the floor.\u0027 I go, \u0027Want to get some blow?\u0027 He\u0027s like, \u0027Yeah, let\u0027s get some blow.\u0027 And we just basically reenacted what was happening on the road.\u0022\u000A\u000A* Nikki, on the contract that legally dissolves the band after the tour is over: \u0022I think it\u0027s also going to be interesting next time a band announces a farewell touris it a farewell tour? Or is it like Mötley Crüe? Where\u0027s your contract? And I think the press is going to start calling bands out, because I think that what bothered us is that we were trying to say goodbye and people were going, \u0027Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Goodbye for now, until you need money.\u0027\u0022\u000A\u000A* Nikki, on fighting: \u0022We used to fight because it was fun. And the bandnot Mickbut me and Tommy and Vince would go down to the Whisky A Go Go or the Troubadour and get into fights because it was fun.\u0022\u000A\u000ADid you ever fight each other for fun? Just go into each other\u0027s dressing room and be like, \u0022You know what? Today, let\u0027s just beat the shit out of each other.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Not really for fun, but we definitely fought.\u0022\u000A\u000A* Nikki, on if he\u0027ll let his kids read The Dirt: \u0022I\u0027d rather them not. It\u0027s so weird to be one of the guys from The Dirt and to be a dad. My one son said to me one daywe were talking about some people we know that were struggling with drugs and alcoholand he said, \u0027Dad, why do you want other people to have a higher standard than you did?\u0027 And I was like, \u0027Because it doesn\u0027t work.\u0027\u0022\u000A\u000A* Tommy: \u0022We fucking rocked this shit. This is bad-ass. And also happy in a way that this is the way we pictured this fucking thing ending, not like fucking playing the fucking county fair.\u0022\u000A\u000A* Tommy, on whether or not he\u0027s become a different person since 1981: \u0022Oh my god, fuck yeah. Just a different fucking guy, completely. Well, not completely. Almost completely.\u0022\u000A\u000A* Tommy, on whether or not the band would succeed today: \u0022Everything is so fucking different. I would say probably not. I can\u0027t keep up with all the fucking music and the fucking videos. It\u0027s fucking insane. And imagine a fan. I\u0027m in the fucking business and I\u0027m having a hard time. It\u0027s impossible for them. So they just kind of get pieces of information and gravitate toward what they like and so much goes fucking whizzing by them. Like, \u0027Oh, Mötley Crüe.\u0027 Today, I believe that\u0027s what would happen. I know local guys in bands that are trying to get their tracks on the fucking radio and just trying to get noticed, and it\u0027s almost impossible, dude. And for what? These guys are fucking busting their balls to sell records and they don\u0027tno one sells records. I can see it in their faces; they look fucking defeated before they\u0027ve even started.\u0022\u000A\u000A* I\u0027d be remiss if I didn\u0027t include a quick list of my favorite Motley Crue songs here. They\u0027re pretty much the same as everyone else\u0027s:\u000A\u000AKickstart My HeartPrimal ScreamLooks That KillLive WireShout At The DevilWild Side\u000A\u000A*And the worst? Girls, Girls, Girls. I got nothing against the video, which is basically nothing but stripper footage, but that is a bad song. A cat could play that song on a xylophone, and probably has.\u000A\u000A* Manager Allen Kovac, on getting the band back together for this tour: \u0022Heavy lifting is an understatement.\u0022\u000A\u000A* Kovac, on whether every member of the band is clean: \u0022When I saw them last, it certainly seemed that way, but you never know the way the wind blows.\u0022\u000A\u000A* Guitar tech Bobby O, on touring with Taylor Swift: \u0022She\u0027s great. To me, she seemed like a little girl. And they got FBI or CIA or militarythere\u0027s always heavy security around her, too. Retired guys.\u0022\u000A\u000A* FANS! Here are a few random quotes from the many, many Crue fans I met over the summer:\u000A\u000A\u0022If I got rock \u0027n\u0027 roll, I\u0027m forever young.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I grew up with them, but I was scared of them.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022They\u0027ll figure out a way out of the contract.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I was in high school in \u002783, when they first came out with their Shout at the Devil. I wasn\u0027t allowed to listen to them, so I had to listen to them on the sly. I was raised Baptist, and they had a pentagram. The pentagram wasn\u0027t allowed. I wasn\u0027t allowed to own a Mötley record; I went to my friend\u0027s house to listen to Mötley records.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s all for theatrics. I mean, Gene Simmons is a Jew. He doesn\u0027t worship the devil; it\u0027s all for fun.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Do you know what I call Slayer? Puppy-killing music. Puppy-killing music. It\u0027s what you would kill puppies to.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t know how long Mick\u0027s got. Seriously, to look at him... it\u0027s rough.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I get all sappy. This is a big chunk of my childhood right here, you know? My youth. It\u0027s ending and it\u0027s becoming something else.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I like Vince. He\u0027s a prick. I love his jacket. I love single moms.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I graduated in \u002783, so we\u0027re old as fuck.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022They reeked of sex, that\u0027s what my mom said. When they were like, with their tongues.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t even listen to rock; I just came for the ladies. I came because their dad\u0027s paying, I was like, \u0027Fuck it, free concert.\u0027\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022It gives me a sense of home, I guess. I always would go to Dad\u0027s house and he\u0027s always playing classic rock, Mötley Crüe. He plays Mötley Crüe, he plays Boston.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Pop\u0027s bullshit. I fucking hate all that shit. It\u0027s fake; it\u0027s fucking fake.\u0022\u000A\u000A* One final story: as we were leaving the Dallas show, I saw one drunk lady get loaded onto a stretcher and packed into an ambulance. She was crying her eyes out. We left the arena and ended up stuck behind that same ambulance. Then another car started tailgating us and honking at us to move out of the way. I assume it was the drunk lady\u0027s husband or something. The second we pulled over to let the car pass, it rode right up the ambulance\u0027s ass and the driver rolled down his window to give us the finger. ROCK AND ROLL IS STILL ALIVE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.",

First off, if you&#x2019;d like to learn more about Motley, specifically more about how many drugs they took and women they slept with, I urge you to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Dirt-Confessions-Worlds-Notorious/dp/0060989157">The Dirt</a>, the autobiography they co-wrote with Neil Strauss. It remains the finest book about music ever written (I have read no other books about music, but remain confident of the assertion).</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1">Also, if you&#x2019;re gonna go see Motley on this farewell tour (GO!), make sure you see them in an indoor arena. I saw the band inside in Austin and outside in Dallas and the sound inside was way better. When I stood at the back of the Dallas pavilion with all the drunks and stoner burnouts, all you could hear were the backing tracks. I&#x2019;ve got nothing against backing trackspretty much every artist on Earth uses them nowbut the mix was better indoors. That Austin show was one of my favorite concert-going experiences ever. It&#x2019;s nice to see a band in a club, because you can see them up close, but there&#x2019;s something to be said for 20,000 metalheads in one room, screaming their heads off. I never got to see Motley when I was a kid. It was very much worth the wait.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.2">Prepare yourself for one small quirk in the setlist, though: At both shows I attended, the first song was &quot;Saints of Los Angeles,&quot; a latter day track that I didn&#x2019;t give a shit about. The rest of the set was pretty much all the kickass hits. But that opener was a weird choice.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.3">Got all that? Good. Now let&#x2019;s dive a little bit deeper into the gutter:</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong></strong>* Nikki Sixx brings his dog, a golden retriever named Leica, on tour with him. Leica essentially serves as Nikki&#x2019;s therapy dog, to give him something to do on the road and keep his ass out of trouble: &quot;It&#x2019;s so easy out here to get disconnected from reality,&quot; he told me. &quot;It&#x2019;s about sleep, rest, work, performance, sleep, rest, work, performance. And then, next thing you know, you&#x2019;ve been away from your house so long, it kind of takes you a second to get acclimated to reality. So he&#x2019;s a big part for me of being like, &#x2019;Hey, he&#x2019;s my dog. I&#x2019;ve got a responsibility.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s really easy out here when you&#x2019;re in a band&#x2019;Hey, Nikki, can I get you a water, can I get you a drink, can I get you your food, what do you want after the show&#x2019;everyone walks you everywhere, you&#x2019;ve got security with you. It&#x2019;s like, <em>fuck, I&#x2019;m not a person anymore! I&#x2019;m an adult!</em> And I&#x2019;m not the road manager anymore; I&#x2019;m not the father; I&#x2019;m not in control of my life. You&#x2019;re kind of a box of soap.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong></strong>* Fans know all about Leica. At the Dallas show, I met two twenty-something girls in pancake makeup, both named Jenna, who were at the show <em>specifically</em> because they loved the dog and wanted to see it. (SPOILER: The dog is not in the show.) Here is my exchange with the two Jennas:</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.7">JENNA 1: I just actually want to see the dog. Tell [Nikki] I love his dog. I tweeted about his dog and he favorited it, but he didn&#x2019;t reply so I was like, &quot;Damn.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.8">ME: Do you also like the dog?</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.9">JENNA 2: Yes. I love the dog. It&#x2019;s the cutest dog in the world.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.a">ME: Do you love the music?</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.b">JENNA 2: Oh, fuck no.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.c">JENNA 1: She doesn&#x2019;t.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong></strong>* Three months ago, Nikki went to get heart checked and he was honest on all his forms. He ticked off every drug he ever used (&quot;Everything was checked. It was amazing. Look at that! I made straight As!&quot;), and then the doctors asked if he had every had any heart problems.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.e">&quot;Well, I was dead for two minutes, and they brought me back to life with two shots of adrenaline,&quot; he told them (<em>For those of you that may not know, this is a true story. Nikki overdosed on heroin and his heart stopped</em>). Concerned, the doctors hooked him up with electrodes, placed him on a treadmill, and took an EKG.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.f">&quot;And they&#x2019;re showing the heart,&quot; Nikki told me, &quot;And they&#x2019;re going, &#x2019;There&#x2019;s no scarring, and everything is working. Your heart is like a fucking 25-year-old.&#x2019; And there was just a part of me, when I left, that was like, all right, I got to do all <em>that</em>, and I&#x2019;m still healthy. So FUCK YOU!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong></strong>* More fan mayhem: In Dallas, there was line of cars stretching out from the parking lot entrance prior to the start of the show. I was in a car with our photographer and his assistant, and we noticed that the traffic stretched over a section of Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) track. The pickup truck in front of us tried to sneak over the track and get closer to the entrance, but got stuck just as the train was approaching and the fucking crossing gate was coming down. And we watched in horror as the gate landed ON THE ROOF of the pickup and bounced off. I thought we were gonna watch the thing get smashed to pieces by the oncoming streetcar. But the train slowed and eventually there was enough space for the loon in the truck in front of us to move ahead. I&#x2019;ve never seen a railroad gate crash down onto a car. That is a tense moment.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong></strong>* Outside the back entrance of the arena, I was chilling with a bouncer guarding the loading dock prior to the show. He was trimming his fingernails with a hunting knife. At one point, two women in a car tried to park near the tour buses, even moving a traffic cone out of the way, and the guard got super pissed and angrily shooed them away. The driver had on a halter top that made her tits nearly touch her chin. I went up to her.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;Are you trying to get closer to the band?&quot; I asked.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.j">&quot;Fuck the band!&quot; she yelled. &quot;I don&#x2019;t want to walk that far.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong></strong>* Wanna be a roadie? Guess what? BEING A ROADIE SUCKS. For back-to-back shows in different towns, the average roadie has to get up at 5am to start unloading shit out of the buses, then they gotta spend all day assembling the stage, and then they have to wait until the show is over at midnight to break it all down, load it back into the buses, and then sleep in the back of a bus (Viggy showed me the beds in the back of one; the bus had ten little tiny bunks) for maybe four hours before you have to get up and do it all over again. Not much time for sex and drugs in that workday. It&#x2019;s a military operation and you cannot get in the way of it. When I was hanging out backstage, I was in the way of pretty much everything, and so my primary goal was to not get yelled at by anyone. I failed many times. There are bazillion people backstage and it&#x2019;s impossible to keep track of who the fuck is who between the roadies and managers and techs and tour people and band people and arena people and label people. The org chart probably looks like a spirograph.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong></strong>* At one point, to avoid being in the way, I went outside to the loading dock and hung out in the rain. And while I was standing there, this big black school bus rolls right up to the back door. I could see black lights and red velvet curtains decorating the inside. Motley&#x2019;s tour manager was NOT pleased. He went running up to the bus yelling, &quot;No no no no no!&quot; And this one young guy gets off as a stream of wasted middle-aged people carrying Dos Equis bottles came storming out after him.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.m">&quot;What is this?&quot; the tour manager asked.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.n">&quot;We&#x2019;re throwing my father-in-law a birthday party.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.o">&quot;Well, you can&#x2019;t be here!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.p">And then I watched as all the drunkies piled back into the black bus and drove off to the regular parking lot. There&#x2019;s nothing better than drunk people who just say FUCK IT and try to go wherever they please. Speaking of which...</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong></strong>* You might think a Motley Crue concert would be nothing but old guys, but you would be wrong. There were young people all over the joint. I saw plenty of teenagers who had discovered the band on their own. At the Dallas show, I met one shirtless kid (&quot;Where did your shirt go?&quot; &quot;I was hot&quot;) whose three favorite bands were Opeth, Paramore, and Motley Crue, which had to be some kind of record for weirdest three favorite bands. I saw countless father-daughter combinations, including a dude named Greg who dressed up like Nikki and who was with his teenage daughter. &quot;Back about &#x2019;81 or so,&quot; he told me, &quot;I saw a picture, just of the album cover. I knew there was an attitude. I was turnedcan&#x2019;t say &#x2019;turned on&#x2019;but I was turned on to them right away, just by the look.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.r">I also saw tons of women: young, old, whatever. The women outnumbered the men at both shows. I was too intimidated to talk to some of the groupies. Even at 38 years old, I don&#x2019;t have the confidence to walk up to a woman in clingy dress and just start talking her up cold.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong></strong>* I also saw a dude wearing a shirt that said I SHAVED MY BALLS FOR THIS? I asked; he didn&#x2019;t.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong></strong>* I asked a bunch of people if they bought the whole &quot;last tour&quot; spiel and their answers were mixed. One dude named Jason almost looked annoyed he had to shell out for the last show when he sure it wasn&#x2019;t going to be. &quot;Fuck off, we went to George Strait&#x2019;s supposed last show. They&#x2019;ll be back again. Child support payment&#x2019;s come due... Back taxes, come on.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong></strong>* I also met Big Silly, a four-hundred pound man wearing overalls and nothing else. Big Silly couldn&#x2019;t remember the last Motley concert he went to because he was tripping on acid at the time. &quot;All I remember is [Tommy] swirling on the drums.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong></strong>* This final tour is actually a variation on a show Motley staged during a residency at the Hard Rock casino in Vegas a while back. And when a rock concert stays in the same place forever, there&#x2019;s a whole lot more leeway as to what kind of pyrotechnics and shit the show can have. You don&#x2019;t have to deal with changing venues or dopey local ordinances. Viggy: &quot;When you tour, you have to be able to have it get torn down and go back out again. When you have something that&#x2019;s almost a permanent kind of show, it&#x2019;s a better show. To a degree.&quot; So go to Vegas if your favorite band takes up residency there.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong></strong>* Viggy again: &quot;Metallica&#x2019;s the only band in the world that still shows up to the show in their Armani suits and goes and puts on the dungarees and black shirts. And then when they&#x2019;re done, they get back into their Armani suits and leave. I&#x2019;m like, &#x2019;Wait a minute, that&#x2019;s a little weird.&#x2019; With [Motley], you barely can get them to shower.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong></strong>* When I asked Tommy if he had any regrets about his life and career, he brought up his parents, both of whom passed away in the new century. His mother died two years ago. His father died shortly after 9/11, which Tommy watched on TV while sitting at his deathbed. &quot;I&#x2019;m sitting there with my dad, he&#x2019;s fucking dying, and I noticed that, when people get older and they are in that position where they&#x2019;re about to check out, they start feeling helpless and regretting shitso if you ask me this question maybe 40 years from now or something, maybe I&#x2019;d have a different answer, but for now, <em>fuck no</em>. I&#x2019;ve done enough stuff to burn several brain cells. I&#x2019;ve got one left, and I&#x2019;m saving it for tomorrow.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.y"><em>I remember you said that you were someone who had insecurities and craved recognition. Do you still feel that way? </em></p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.z">&quot;Yeah, for sure. You want to fucking leave a mark here. You want to be known for certain things and have made a denta huge dentin this shit. Not just like, &#x2019;Oh, yeah, he was cool.&#x2019; Fuck that, dude.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong></strong>* True story: Right after the show in Austin ended, one of the ladies next to me saw me jotting down shit in a notebook and asked me what I was doing. And when I explained to her that I was with GQ, she asked me who I&#x2019;d profiled in the past. I mentioned the <a href="../entertainment/celebrities/201306/kid-rock-annual-cruise-gq-june-2013">Kid Rock cruise</a> to her and her jaw dropped. &quot;I WAS ON THAT CRUISE!&quot; she screamed. And then she started punching me. Like, hard! It really hurt. Turns out her best friends&#x2019; tits were featured prominently in the photos accompanying that article. You can see said tits <a href="../entertainment/travel-features/201306/photos-kid-rocks-rock-n-roll-cruise#slide=20">right here</a>. Small world! The woman did not care for the foul language in the story.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong></strong>* I did NOT see any exposed breasts at either Motley show, by the way. Kid Rock wins on the exposed boob front.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.12"><strong></strong>* After that woman punched me, I ran into another fan (drunk) and asked him what he thought of the show.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.13">&quot;They didn&#x2019;t play everything,&quot; he complained.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.14">&quot;Really?&quot; I asked. &quot;What didn&#x2019;t they play?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.15">&quot;Shout at the Devil.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.16">&quot;Yes they did!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.17">And the dude paused for a full minute and then was like... &quot;Oh yeah! They did!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.18"><strong></strong>* I asked another guy what he thought of the show and he stuck his thumb sideways.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.19">&quot;Why not the full thumbs up?&quot; I asked.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1a">&quot;Because I didn&#x2019;t get a handjob!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><strong></strong>* Want a t-shirt from the tour? That&#x2019;ll be $40. Beer was $12. BIG CONCESSION has you by the nuts when it comes to rock concerts. I bought a plastic Motley wristband for five bucks. It was the cheapest thing on the table, and I&#x2019;ve worn it ever since. I almost lost it a while back and freaked out because I had overpaid so dearly for it. Five bucks is still a decent amount of money to me.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><strong></strong>* I made the drive from Austin to Dallas and my friend who lives in the state told me that I had to stop by Waco along the way and hit up a joint called the Czech Stop. Apparently, Waco has an enormous Czech population, and everyone stops there on the way to Dallas to pick up a bunch of Czech pastries. It&#x2019;s the weirdest fucking shit I&#x2019;ve ever seen. When I think of Texas, I think of beef and guns and fake tits. It never occurred to me that you should go there to get a quality kolache.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><strong></strong>* With the exception of Vince, who wears jeans and flip flops when he&#x2019;s not on stage, the rest of the band dressed like rock stars during off hours: gun necklaces and braided wrist chains and rings and all that shit. And I gotta say, if you&#x2019;re in your fifties, you&#x2019;ll look a whole lot younger if you dress older. That&#x2019;s not a knock on the boys... just my opinion.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><strong></strong>* At the Austin VIP meet and greet, arena officials presented each member of the band with a commemorative gift basket, including all kinds of local hot sauces (Nice!). And in the receiving line, you could definitely see a few guys playing it cool, like they didn&#x2019;t want to look TOO starstruck around the band because it wouldn&#x2019;t look manly. Other guys didn&#x2019;t give a shit and would go running up to Nikki and Vince and Mick hooting and hollering. It was a highly amusing little dichotomy.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><strong></strong>* Viggy on Tommy Lee: &quot;Tommy Lee is the rock star&#x2019;s rock star. Slash and [former Stone Temple Pilot Scott]Weiland will be at the club and even they freak out when Tommy Lee shows up.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><strong></strong>* I was in the crowd in Dallas when a drunk girl grabbed me by the arm and leaned into me to whisper, &quot;Buy me a drink,&quot; in my ear. And when she leaned over, she fell past me and toppled right into the aisle. An older man who came with her (the dad?) helped me get her back on her feet. I felt terrible. RAWK AND ROLL, AMERICA!</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><strong></strong>* Fun fact: If you type Motley Crue into an iPhone, it adds the umlauts for you automatically. If I were in the band, I&#x2019;d be super proud of that fact.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1i"><strong></strong>* Looking for a laser show during the farewell tour? I&#x2019;m sorry to say that you are shit out of luck. One guy backstage explained to me that you will rarely see lasers at rock concerts anymore due to safety concerns (NOTE: Lawyers ruin everything). &quot;Next time you see lasers at a show,&quot; he said, &quot;see which way the lasers are pointing (at this point, he pointed up to the ceiling). Now in Europe, they don&#x2019;t give a shit.&quot; So if you want some lasers shooting out into the crowd during a rock show, get your ass to Europe.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1j"><strong></strong>* Time to hear from the band! Here&#x2019;s Mick Mars: &quot;I got on a plane to go back to Canada to record the rest of the John Corabi album&quot;the infamous self-titled 1994 album that the band recorded after temporarily firing Vince&quot;and I got booted off, because this onewhat do they call them nowadays? I always called them stewardesses. And she just got a hair up her butt because John came on and he hadwhat do you call it? A rainstick. And the lady goes, &#x2019;What&#x2019;s that?&#x2019; And I said, &#x2019;It&#x2019;s a bong.&#x2019; And she thought I said &#x2019;bomb.&#x2019; So she had that hair in her up her butt. And she really didn&#x2019;t like me, and I was already tipsy, so I was being a little cocky. So, the plane takes off and the captain comes back and he goes, &#x2019;Hey, you need to calm down.&#x2019; And, nope. The plane turned around and dropped me off. Turned all the way back. They&#x2019;d taken off; they circled LAX, came back, and landed. Booted me off.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1k"><strong></strong>* Vince, on the band&#x2019;s success: &quot;We got really lucky when we started out; it was the beginning of MTV. It was the exact same year MTV started, &#x2019;81, and so the videos really helped us along. You don&#x2019;t really do that for rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll anymore, at all. And I think the timing was, like, coming out of punk in the &#x2019;70s and the glam stuff, and we just kind of fit right in the middle of that, so it was all timing too. That&#x2019;s when L.A. was the hot-spot for bands, and we just happened to be there, so there was a lot of luck involved. There&#x2019;ll never be another scene like that again.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1l"><strong></strong>* Financially speaking, Motley Crue will probably benefit from the death of rock and roll. Music is so divided now and has exploded into so many niche markets that a lot of the music from the &#x2019;80s and &#x2019;90s just increases in value every year because it always has a set audience of tens of millions of people, and that won&#x2019;t be the case for current artists as the audience gets progressively fragmented. There are maybe two or three BIG rock songs every year now, if that. Motley Crue has a dozen or more. That will be valuable to ad and movie people FOREVER. In retrospect, it&#x2019;s kind of amazing that the band can still consistently fill arenas despite not having a new hit in over two decades. That just how valuable some of these songs are.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1m"><strong></strong>* Nikki, on coming back home after the &quot;Shout at the Devil:&quot; tour: &quot;It was one of the most vacant times in my life, because you dream for this thing and you get it, and I remember getting it and then grabbing it by its throat and just ripping its throat out every nightjust fucking young and hungry and what&#x2019;s next and bigger, louder, just pushing the envelope, and a super creative high. And I remember getting dumped at my house, which was an apartment. So I went from living in an apartment I could barely fucking get by in, to coming back and being a multi-millionaire, and not having no friends, no girlfriend, no fucking life. I had two plants that I&#x2019;d gotten from some girls that were in my apartmentthey were dead. There was nothing else in there; I had a bowl, I had a spoon, I had a fork. I came home and I remember sitting in my front room like this, and I didn&#x2019;t really know what to do so I called Tommy. I go, &#x2019;What are you doing?&#x2019; He goes, &#x2019;I&#x2019;m sitting here staring at the floor.&#x2019; I go, &#x2019;Want to get some blow?&#x2019; He&#x2019;s like, &#x2019;Yeah, let&#x2019;s get some blow.&#x2019; And we just basically reenacted what was happening on the road.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1n"><strong></strong>* Nikki, on the contract that legally dissolves the band after the tour is over: &quot;I think it&#x2019;s also going to be interesting next time a band announces a farewell touris it a farewell tour? Or is it like M&#xF6;tley Cr&#xFC;e? Where&#x2019;s your contract? And I think the press is going to start calling bands out, because I think that what bothered us is that we were trying to say goodbye and people were going, &#x2019;Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Goodbye for now, until you need money.&#x2019;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1o"><strong></strong>* Nikki, on fighting: &quot;We used to fight because it was fun. And the bandnot Mickbut me and Tommy and Vince would go down to the Whisky A Go Go or the Troubadour and get into fights because it was fun.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1p"><em>Did you ever fight each other for fun?

It&#x2019;s so weird to be one of the guys from The Dirt and to be a dad. My one son said to me one daywe were talking about some people we know that were struggling with drugs and alcoholand he said, &#x2019;Dad, why do you want other people to have a higher standard than you did?&#x2019; And I was like, &#x2019;Because it doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x2019;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1s"><strong></strong>* Tommy: &quot;We fucking rocked this shit.

Just a different fucking guy, completely. Well, not completely. Almost completely.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1u"><strong></strong>* Tommy, on whether or not the band would succeed today: &quot;Everything is so fucking different. I would say probably not. I can&#x2019;t keep up with all the fucking music and the fucking videos. It&#x2019;s fucking insane. And imagine a fan. I&#x2019;m in the fucking business and <em>I&#x2019;m</em> having a hard time. It&#x2019;s impossible for them. So they just kind of get pieces of information and gravitate toward what they like and so much goes fucking whizzing by them. Like, &#x2019;Oh, M&#xF6;tley Cr&#xFC;e.&#x2019; Today, I believe that&#x2019;s what would happen. I know local guys in bands that are trying to get their tracks on the fucking radio and just trying to get noticed, and it&#x2019;s almost impossible, dude. And for what? These guys are fucking busting their balls to sell records and they don&#x2019;tno one sells records.

A cat could play that song on a xylophone, and probably has.</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1y"><strong></strong>* Manager Allen Kovac, on getting the band back together for this tour: &quot;Heavy lifting is an understatement.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.1z"><strong></strong>* Kovac, on whether every member of the band is clean: &quot;When I saw them last, it certainly seemed that way, but you never know the way the wind blows.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.20"><strong></strong>* Guitar tech Bobby O, on touring with Taylor Swift: &quot;She&#x2019;s great.

Retired guys.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.21"><strong></strong>* FANS! Here are a few random quotes from the many, many Crue fans I met over the summer:</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.22">&quot;If I got rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll, I&#x2019;m forever young.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.23">&quot;I grew up with them, but I was scared of them.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.24">&quot;They&#x2019;ll figure out a way out of the contract.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.25">&quot;I was in high school in &#x2019;83, when they first came out with their Shout at the Devil. I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to listen to them, so I had to listen to them on the sly. I was raised Baptist, and they had a pentagram. The pentagram wasn&#x2019;t allowed. I wasn&#x2019;t allowed to own a M&#xF6;tley record; I went to my friend&#x2019;s house to listen to M&#xF6;tley records.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.26">&quot;It&#x2019;s all for theatrics. I mean, Gene Simmons is a Jew. He doesn&#x2019;t worship the devil; it&#x2019;s all for fun.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.27">&quot;Do you know what I call Slayer? Puppy-killing music. Puppy-killing music. It&#x2019;s what you would kill puppies to.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.28">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know how long Mick&#x2019;s got. Seriously, to look at him... it&#x2019;s rough.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.29">&quot;I get all sappy. This is a big chunk of my childhood right here, you know? My youth. It&#x2019;s ending and it&#x2019;s becoming something else.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.2a"><strong>&quot;</strong>I like Vince. He&#x2019;s a prick. I love his jacket. I love single moms.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.2b">&quot;I graduated in &#x2019;83, so we&#x2019;re old as fuck.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.2c">&quot;They reeked of sex, that&#x2019;s what my mom said. When they were like, with their tongues.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.2d">&quot;I don&#x2019;t even listen to rock; I just came for the ladies.

I always would go to Dad&#x2019;s house and he&#x2019;s always playing classic rock, M&#xF6;tley Cr&#xFC;e. He plays M&#xF6;tley Cr&#xFC;e, he plays Boston.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".we07oc7x8g.1.1.0.0.4.2f">&quot;Pop&#x2019;s bullshit. I fucking hate all that shit.

She was crying her eyes out. We left the arena and ended up stuck behind that same ambulance. Then another car started tailgating us and honking at us to move out of the way. I assume it was the drunk lady&#x2019;s husband or something. The second we pulled over to let the car pass, it rode right up the ambulance&#x2019;s ass and the driver rolled down his window to give us the finger.
