  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ANinety-nine percent of people who listen to hip-hop have never sold drugs. But one-hundred percent have had their heartbroken. In the span of just three years, Drake has captured the temperament and thoughts of that generation. There are thousands of people, perfect strangers to Drake, convinced that songs like \u0022Marvins Room\u0022 or \u0022Trust Issues\u0022 were written about their lives. But they\u0027re actually true tales of a romantic trapped in a superficial world. Ever since Take Care, his third album (we know you think it\u0027s his second but he classifies So Far Gone as an album, not a mixtape—and so do we, so kick rocks) leaked this week, the response has been, well, massive. Drake gave us the back-story on the album\u0027s title, how it stacks up against his other albums, and the real meaning behind some of your favorite Drizzy lyrics.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: It seems like the world is excited.\u000A\u000A Drake: [Huge smile] Yeah, man, I hope so.\u000A\u000AGQ: You announced the title of this album, Take Care, with us back in December. What does it mean? \u000A\u000A Drake: No one has actually asked me that yet. I came up with the name when I was on a bus in Birmingham, England, going to a show. \u0022Take Care\u0022 is this thing we use in passing conversation to dismiss bullshit like, \u0022Oh, you couldn\u0027t make it on time? Oh, take care, take care.\u0022 We\u0027ve always used that and then I really took so much care making this album. I knew I was going to go home and take longer than six months, I knew that I was literally going to take care of making this project and be attentive, be clear, be immersed in it. \u0022Take Care\u0022 worked.\u000A\u000AGQ: You seem more excited releasing Take Care than you were with Thank Me Later. Do you have any regrets with your last album?\u000A\u000A Drake: No, I never regret. It did amazing things for my career and as a sonic composition, I\u0027m still proud of it. It was just very weird to make an album, for sale, in four months on a tour bus. It wasn\u0027t So Far Gone. So Far Gone was my first album, so I felt like it was unfair to me. Like damn, I just made So Far Gone. Now I have to come right back out with another piece.\u000A\u000AGQ: And that is what people were going to call your first album.\u000A\u000A Drake: Right! This is what people are going to call my first album when really [So Far Gone] was my first album. I shouldn\u0027t have to rush this because I just gave you a body of work. Give me a minute. So I made Thank Me Later and it did great for me but you\u0027re right, I was immediately on to my next one.\u000A\u000AGQ: So what\u0027s different now?\u000A\u000A Drake: I\u0027m going to make this a moment for myself. I followed through on my vision...even the songs that are out now like \u0022Trust Issues\u0022and \u0022Club Paradise,\u0022 \u0022Free Spirit,\u0022 \u0022Headlines,\u0022 \u0022Make Me Proud,\u0022 \u0022Marvins Room,\u0022 \u0022The Motto,\u0022 I\u0027m all very proud of. That\u0027s an album in and of itself and I have nineteen more songs to give you on November 15th.\u000A\u000AGQ: So rank them, if you will, best to worst: So Far Gone, Thank Me Later, and Take Care...\u000A\u000A Drake: It\u0027s hard for me to put So Far Gone second because it\u0027s the first time anyone ever really paid attention or heard me. But I\u0027m going to be honest with you, Take Care, then So Far Gone, then Thank Me Later...\u000A\u000AGQ: Some of the features on this album are crazy. Wayne, Nicki, Rihanna, some unknown guy named Andre 3000...\u000A\u000A Drake: He murdered that shit! He killed it and 40 switched the beat, it\u0027s nasty. I didn\u0027t get to see him record, but speaking with him was great and we even spoke about projects beyond \u0022The Real Her.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I wish that we lived in a time and a generation where people would stop viewing my honesty as overly emotional. People always act like I spend my life crying in a dark room. I don\u0027t, I\u0027m good. I\u0027m a man.\u0022\u000A\u000AGQ: You said that, \u0022Just by buying your album, you know a lot of shit about me.\u0022 So let\u0027s break down some lyrics. \u0022Why is this so familiar? Just met/already feel like I know the real her.\u0022 \u000A\u000A Drake: I guess sometimes I feel like I\u0027m laying next to the same woman over and over again. The things that they say, the place they are in their life, the concerns they have about me and my life. I feel like I deal with the same women repetitively. The ones I\u0027m referring to in that song have all fucked the same rappers. So, yeah, that\u0027s why I say we just met but I think I\u0027ve already met the real her, because I\u0027ve already met you so many times, in different shapes and forms—it all feels familiar.\u000A\u000AGQ: Who\u0027s the ideal girl for Drake?\u000A\u000A Drake: Who\u0027s the ideal girl? She is very funny, very supportive, understands that right now I\u0027m trying to build with somebody. The ideal girl is driven, working on something other than modeling or being a singer...\u000A\u000AGQ: Or being seen.\u000A\u000A Drake: Or being seen! She\u0027s probably in New York to be honest with you. There are a lot of good women in New York.\u000A\u000AGQ: The next lyric is from \u0022Marvins Room.\u0022 Everyone with vocal cords uploaded their own version of your song to YouTube. Whose version was your favorite? \u000A\u000A Drake: I mean everybody says JoJo\u0027s but you know I don\u0027t really have a favorite. Actually, my version is my favorite and I never say stuff like that. But really though, my version is my favorite because there is such a story behind it.\u000A\u000AGQ: Let\u0027s get into the story. \u0022The woman that I would try, is happy with a good guy.\u0022 Who\u0027s the girl you\u0027re talking about?\u000A\u000A Drake: It\u0027s not about one particular female. It\u0027s just an emotion that I\u0027ve experienced. I\u0027ve texted girls late at night saying, \u0022I miss you,\u0022 and she\u0027ll be like, \u0022I\u0027m out on a date.\u0022 She is happy, somewhere else.\u000A\u000AGQ: Wait, you\u0027re one of the top artists in the world right now. That still happens to you, in 2011? \u000A\u000A Drake: Yeah, definitely.\u000A\u000AGQ: What type of wildly successful girls are you dating to where they\u0027d dis you? Oprah?\u000A\u000A Drake: [laughs] I wish I dated Oprah. No, they\u0027re mostly girls from Toronto that know the real me and don\u0027t give a fuck about who \u0022Drake\u0022 is or what he\u0027s accomplished. And then there are a lot of girls who get a kick out of doing that to me because of who I am. A lot of girls want to purposefully drive a point home.\u000A\u000AGQ: Last lyric: \u0022I be getting high just to balance out the lows.\u0022 [Drake begins to shake his head.] What\u0027s the lowest point of your career?\u000A\u000A Drake: Hmm, what do you think is the lowest point of my career and I\u0027ll see if I agree with you.\u000A\u000AGQ: I think Thank Me Later was the best album on the shelves when it came out, but you felt like you could have made a better album. \u000A\u000A Drake: I\u0027m in agreeance with that, definitely that combined with the videos for \u0022Miss Me\u0022 and \u0022Fancy.\u0022I just watched the videos and was like, \u0022What the fuck are these videos about?\u0022 That\u0027s why \u0022Fancy\u0022 never came out. It was a weird moment.\u000A\u000AGQ: On to something a little lighter. We\u0027re GQ, so we have to ask: What\u0027s up with the sweaters?\u000A\u000A Drake: [laughs] Now, this I have been asked about several times.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you have a favorite?\u000A\u000A Drake: Yes, I do. It\u0027s a toss-up between three sweaters. I\u0027d say one would be obviously the OVO Owl Sweater. I can wear it repetitively and no one calls me out on it. I have a cashmere Hermes sweater that I love. Lastly, any of my Missoni sweaters. I don\u0027t give a fuck what anybody says about my Missoni sweaters! Fuck you, if you don\u0027t like my sweater! [Editor\u0027s note: A middle-aged couple sitting next to us sharply turn their heads.] It\u0027s funny because people only talk about me and sweaters because I don\u0027t give them anything else to talk about. I live in Canada, so any dirt I do you\u0027ll never see because we don\u0027t have the paparazzi up there! It\u0027s the stupidest thing, man, but I\u0027ll embrace it. Hopefully Missoni hollers at me and we get a sweater line popping!\u000A\u000AGQ: When Lil Wayne and Jay-Z made passing references to each other earlier this year, did you feel like you were in a compromising situation? We know you really look up to Jay and you really look up to Wayne.\u000A\u000A Drake: I\u0027m just riding with Wayne, always. I\u0027ll never sit here and say that Wayne compromised me. I\u0027m just doing what I got do. I\u0027m a Cash Money soldier. That\u0027s who I ride for.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you think it was blown out of proportion?\u000A\u000A Drake: I mean, not really. I think it was pretty clear-cut. I think anybody denying anything at this point is silly. And I\u0027ve said that before for either of them to say, \u0022Oh, no man, I didn\u0027t mean it,\u0022 it\u0027s like, \u0022Yes you did, man\u0022. But it\u0027s all good, it\u0027s what rap is about. It\u0027s a competitive business.\u000A\u000AGQ: You appeared on Wayne\u0027s \u0022 It\u0027s Good,\u0022 which made reference to Jay. Would you have gotten on \u0022H.A.M.\u0022 with Jay-Z, where he made the initial reference?\u000A\u000A Drake: If I had heard it? No. Because Wayne\u0027s done way more for my career than Jay-Z. Wayne is the reason I\u0027m here. Jay-Z did that for Cole, that\u0027s his artist. Cole\u0027s my brother, he\u0027s an artist I respect so much but I know he\u0027d say the same thing. We\u0027ve got bosses. We\u0027re just falling in line, doing what we got to do.\u000A\u000AGQ: People talk a lot of shit, anything you wish they\u0027d stop saying?\u000A\u000A Drake: That\u0027s tough. I wish that we lived in a time and a generation where people would stop viewing my honesty as overly emotional. People always act like I spend my life crying in a dark room. I don\u0027t, I\u0027m good. I\u0027m a man. I want to be remembered as an artist that gave you a piece of me, as opposed to some surface bullshit. I don\u0027t think people realize that we die, we leave here, and either they forget about you or remember you. And how they remember you is up to you. I just want to be remembered as a poet that was open and honest because I wake up every morning and I\u0027m me.",

But one-hundred percent have had their heartbroken. In the span of just three years, Drake has captured the temperament and thoughts of that generation. There are thousands of people, perfect strangers to Drake, convinced that songs like &quot;Marvins Room&quot; or &quot;Trust Issues&quot; were written about their lives. But they&#x2019;re actually true tales of a romantic trapped in a superficial world. Ever since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Take-Care-Delu-Drake/dp/B005JLN9ZI"><em>Take Care</em></a>, his third album (we know you think it&#x2019;s his second but he classifies <em>So Far Gone</em> as an album, not a mixtape&#x2014;and so do we, so kick rocks) leaked this week, the response has been, well, massive. Drake gave us the back-story on the album&#x2019;s title, how it stacks up against his other albums, and the real meaning behind some of your favorite Drizzy lyrics.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.2"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>GQ: It seems like the world is excited.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>Drake:</strong> <em>[Huge smile]</em> Yeah, man, I hope so.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>GQ: You announced the title of this album, <em>Take Care</em>, with us <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/men-of-the-year/2010/men-of-the-year-issue-covers-portfolio-franco-bridges-colbert-scarlett-johansson#slide=9">back in December</a>. What does it mean? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>Drake:</strong> No one has actually asked me that yet. I came up with the name when I was on a bus in Birmingham, England, going to a show. &quot;Take Care&quot; is this thing we use in passing conversation to dismiss bullshit like, &quot;Oh, you couldn&#x2019;t make it on time? Oh, take care, take care.&quot; We&#x2019;ve always used that and then I really took so much care making this album. I knew I was going to go home and take longer than six months, I knew that I was literally going to take care of making this project and be attentive, be clear, be immersed in it. &quot;Take Care&quot; worked.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>GQ: You seem more excited releasing <em>Take Care</em> than you were with <em>Thank Me Later</em>. Do you have any regrets with your last album?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.9"> <strong>Drake</strong>: No, I never regret. It did amazing things for my career and as a sonic composition, I&#x2019;m still proud of it. It was just very weird to make an album, for sale, in four months on a tour bus. It wasn&#x2019;t <em>So Far Gone</em>. <em>So Far Gone</em> was my first album, so I felt like it was unfair to me. Like damn, I just made <em>So Far Gone</em>. Now I have to come right back out with another piece.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>GQ: And that is what people were going to call your first album.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.b"> <strong>Drake:</strong> Right! This is what people are going to call my first album when really [<em>So Far Gone</em>] was my first album. I shouldn&#x2019;t have to rush this because I just gave you a body of work. Give me a minute. So I made <em>Thank Me Later</em> and it did great for me but you&#x2019;re right, I was immediately on to my next one.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>GQ: So what&#x2019;s different now?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong> Drake:</strong> I&#x2019;m going to make this a moment for myself. I followed through on my vision...even the songs that are out now like &quot;Trust Issues&quot;and<em> &quot;</em>Club Paradise,&quot; &quot;Free Spirit,&quot; &quot;Headlines,&quot; &quot;Make Me Proud,&quot; &quot;Marvins Room,&quot; &quot;The Motto,&quot; I&#x2019;m all very proud of. That&#x2019;s an album in and of itself and I have nineteen more songs to give you on November 15th.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>GQ: So rank them, if you will, best to worst: <em>So Far Gone, Thank Me Later</em>, and <em>Take Care</em>...</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.f"> <strong>Drake:</strong> It&#x2019;s hard for me to put <em>So Far Gone</em> second because it&#x2019;s the first time anyone ever really paid attention or heard me. But I&#x2019;m going to be honest with you, <em>Take Care</em>, then <em>So Far Gone</em>, then <em>Thank Me Later</em>...</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>GQ: Some of the features on this album are crazy. Wayne, Nicki, Rihanna, some unknown guy named Andre 3000...</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.h"> <strong>Drake:</strong> He murdered that shit! He killed it and 40 switched the beat, it&#x2019;s nasty. I didn&#x2019;t get to see him record, but speaking with him was great and we even spoke about projects beyond &quot;The Real Her.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.i"> &quot;I wish that we lived in a time and a generation where people would stop viewing my honesty as overly emotional.

The things that they say, the place they are in their life, the concerns they have about me and my life. I feel like I deal with the same women repetitively. The ones I&#x2019;m referring to in that song have all fucked the same rappers. So, yeah, that&#x2019;s why I say we just met but I think I&#x2019;ve already met the real her, because I&#x2019;ve already met you so many times, in different shapes and forms&#x2014;it all feels familiar.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>GQ: Who&#x2019;s the ideal girl for Drake?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong> Drake:</strong> Who&#x2019;s the ideal girl? She is very funny, very supportive, understands that right now I&#x2019;m trying to build with somebody. The ideal girl is driven, working on something other than modeling or being a singer...</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>GQ: Or being seen.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.o"> <strong>Drake:</strong> Or being seen! She&#x2019;s probably in New York to be honest with you.

Actually, my version is my favorite and I never say stuff like that. But really though, my version is my favorite because there is such a story behind it.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>GQ: Let&#x2019;s get into the story. &quot;The woman that I would try, is happy with a good guy.&quot; Who&#x2019;s the girl you&#x2019;re talking about?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.s"> <strong>Drake:</strong> It&#x2019;s not about one particular female. It&#x2019;s just an emotion that I&#x2019;ve experienced. I&#x2019;ve texted girls late at night saying, &quot;I miss you,&quot; and she&#x2019;ll be like, &quot;I&#x2019;m out on a date.&quot; She is happy, somewhere else.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>GQ: Wait, you&#x2019;re one of the top artists in the world right now.

Oprah?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.w"> <strong>Drake:</strong> <em>[laughs]</em> I wish I dated Oprah. No, they&#x2019;re mostly girls from Toronto that know the real me and don&#x2019;t give a fuck about who &quot;Drake&quot; is or what he&#x2019;s accomplished. And then there are a lot of girls who get a kick out of doing that to me because of who I am.

It was a weird moment.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong>GQ: On to something a little lighter. We&#x2019;re GQ, so we have to ask: What&#x2019;s up with the sweaters?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.12"> <strong>Drake:</strong> <em>[laughs]</em> Now, this I have been asked about several times.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>GQ: Do you have a favorite?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.14"> <strong>Drake:</strong> Yes, I do. It&#x2019;s a toss-up between three sweaters. I&#x2019;d say one would be obviously the OVO Owl Sweater. I can wear it repetitively and no one calls me out on it. I have a cashmere Hermes sweater that I love. Lastly, any of my Missoni sweaters. I don&#x2019;t give a fuck what anybody says about my Missoni sweaters! Fuck you, if you don&#x2019;t like my sweater! <em>[Editor&#x2019;s note: A middle-aged couple sitting next to us sharply turn their heads.] </em>It&#x2019;s funny because people only talk about me and sweaters because I don&#x2019;t give them anything else to talk about. I live in Canada, so any dirt I do you&#x2019;ll never see because we don&#x2019;t have the paparazzi up there! It&#x2019;s the stupidest thing, man, but I&#x2019;ll embrace it. Hopefully Missoni hollers at me and we get a sweater line popping!</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>GQ: When Lil Wayne and Jay-Z made passing references to each other earlier this year, did you feel like you were in a compromising situation? We know you really look up to Jay and you really look up to Wayne.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.16"> <strong>Drake:</strong> I&#x2019;m just riding with Wayne, always. I&#x2019;ll never sit here and say that Wayne compromised me. I&#x2019;m just doing what I got do. I&#x2019;m a Cash Money soldier. That&#x2019;s who I ride for.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.17"><strong>GQ: Do you think it was blown out of proportion?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.18"> <strong>Drake:</strong> I mean, not really. I think it was pretty clear-cut. I think anybody denying anything at this point is silly. And I&#x2019;ve said that before for either of them to say, &quot;Oh, no man, I didn&#x2019;t mean it,&quot; it&#x2019;s like, &quot;Yes you did, man&quot;. But it&#x2019;s all good, it&#x2019;s what rap is about. It&#x2019;s a competitive business.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.19"><strong>GQ: You appeared on Wayne&#x2019;s &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKu5eQCxVwI"> It&#x2019;s Good</a>,&quot; which made reference to Jay. Would you have gotten on &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_tDbetLt-E">H.A.M.</a>&quot; with Jay-Z, where he made the initial reference?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> <strong>Drake:</strong> If I had heard it? No. Because Wayne&#x2019;s done way more for my career than Jay-Z. Wayne is the reason I&#x2019;m here. Jay-Z did that for Cole, that&#x2019;s his artist. Cole&#x2019;s my brother, he&#x2019;s an artist I respect so much but I know he&#x2019;d say the same thing. We&#x2019;ve got bosses. We&#x2019;re just falling in line, doing what we got to do.</p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><strong>GQ: People talk a lot of shit, anything you wish they&#x2019;d stop saying?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> <strong>Drake:</strong> That&#x2019;s tough. I wish that we lived in a time and a generation where people would stop viewing my honesty as overly emotional. People always act like I spend my life crying in a dark room. I don&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;m good. I&#x2019;m a man. I want to be remembered as an artist that gave you a piece of me, as opposed to some surface bullshit. I don&#x2019;t think people realize that we die, we leave here, and either they forget about you or remember you. And how they remember you is up to you. I just want to be remembered as a poet that was open and honest because I wake up every morning and I&#x2019;m me.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".vi8dhgil8g.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
