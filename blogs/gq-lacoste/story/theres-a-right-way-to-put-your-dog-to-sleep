  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADespite the name they gave my dog, my parents were not alcoholics. Far from it. I\u0027m not sure we actually had any booze in the house when I was a kid, and if we did it was probably in a Notre Dame commemorative placekicker bottle, purchased from Service Merchandise with a coupon. We did have a Scotch terrier mix though, and her name was Cutty. Cutty Sark. Like the Scotch.\u000A\u000ACutty was an adorable and slobbery wet mop known for her thick black fur, dragon breath, and scant bladder control. (Seriously, best dog ever, but if you\u0027d brought one of those hotel-room black lights to our carpet, you would have seen nothing but a minefield of long-dried puddles. If I\u0027d had girls over, it would have been a problem. It was not a problem.)\u000A\u000AThere was a lot to like about Cutty: She could smile on command (though it might have been a growl; dog expressions kind of all run together), she could catch mice (which came in handy when you live in a 400-year-old house on some county road in Indiana), and she could consume an entire box of twelve chocolate Santas in one sitting, although the subsequent 24 hours are something I\u0027d like to forget. And without going all Charlie Brown-and-his-Snoopy on you she was a loyal and often damp friend to me for nearly 15 years, which is probably why it fell to me to put her down.\u000A\u000AI\u0027d left for college in the fall, and it was a welcome departure as my home (and by \u0022home\u0022 I mean \u0022my mom\u0027s new condo\u0022) had fallen under a relentlessly dark post-parental divorce cloud. This entailed a lot of my mother sitting in dark rooms smoking, and my brother and I deflecting with Nintendo and also smoking. Depression being depression there was not a lot of attention to external detail going on, but it still surprised me when I came home one fall weekend to find the dog on the couch, dying.\u000A\u000ACutty was an overcaffeinated Ewok for most of her life, and was known for greeting visitors by jumping up and down all over their legs until we could convince her to stop with a treat. Walking her could be an aerobic thrill ride; attaching her leash could be like trying to wrestle a tiny mechanical bull. This morning she didn\u0027t move. She heard the door open, turned her head and looked up at me, motionless, with huge brown eyes that said, \u0022Help.\u0022\u000A\u000ANaturally, I panicked. Well, first I got her a treat, which was a ridiculous idea; you don\u0027t walk up to someone who\u0027s just been in a car wreck and offer them key lime pie, but it was the only thing I could think of that wasn\u0027t calling my mom at work and shouting \u0022HAS ANYONE NOTICED THAT THE DOG IS NOT MOVING?\u0022 which is what I did second. My mother, from twenty miles away in a state-government office, responded that yeah, Cutty had seemed a little tired lately. (Cut to Cutty lying motionless on the couch for nine hours.)\u000A\u000AThirty minutes later, Cutty and I were at the office of the vet, a fortysomething man with a severe close-cropped haircut. He examined the dog, produced an X-ray of an egg-sized tumor near her kidneys, and basically told me, \u0022Dude.\u0022 I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s some unspoken professional rule that vets aren\u0027t allowed to explicitly advocate euthanasia, or this guy just had commitment issues. But we began a series of unbearably tense circular conversations that kept spinning around and around until they reached what was really the only logical ending for a 15-year-old dog with a huge tumor in her belly. Vets may not be able to state the obvious, but they can say things like \u0022The cost of removing the tumor from your 15-year-old dog\u0027s kidneys will be $2,400, which reminds me of a story I read in The Wall Street Journal this morning about the cost of college…\u0022 So I ended up in an awkward staring contest trying to work up the courage to ask this man to kill my dog. It\u0027s like having a breakup conversation with a total stranger in a room full of diplomas.\u000A\u000AWith the plan decided, the vet briefly returned to normal human conversation asked if I wanted a few minutes with Cutty to say my goodbyes, which I answered with a thoughtful \u0022Yrmpf?\u0022 Cutty, quarantined several doors down in her lime-green exam room, totally knew what was up at this point, because when I walked in I found her suddenly full of puppy-like vigor, trying so hard to recapture her former liveliness, jumping up and down like \u0022I\u0027m fine! Look! See! I\u0027m playing! I\u0027m jumping! Look at what a vibrant companion I remain!\u0022 until finally after about 10 seconds you could actually see her expression change to, \u0022I\u0027m so tired.\u0022 I picked her up, and she laid her head down.\u000A\u000AAnd then I left. I left the vet, dragging an empty leash clinking and dragging on the sidewalk, because this vet was all about metaphors. I\u0027d been fortunate to have not experienced many actual deaths by that point, so the concept still had a grand, almost romanticized notion about it: DEATH, THE FINAL ENDING WHICH INVARIABLY GRIPS US ALL. It was dramatic, powerful, crushing. It wasn\u0027t really something that happened at 10:15 a.m. on a Thursday. I wondered all day how long it took, how long she was still alive in that weird little window between her being put to sleep and my walking out the door. Seemed like I should have stuck around. But who knows, maybe they had a schedule to keep.\u000A\u000APeople spin a lot of cornball stories about cat ladies and beagle whisperers and orangutans who are Nearly Human, and I\u0027m not inclined to believe many of them. But look, if it\u0027s possible for a thought to pass from a dying animal to the mind of a dipshit college freshman, it happened, and the thought was, \u0022Make this stop.\u0022 Her death was better this way, as mutual a decision as can be reached between a human and a creature that communicated mostly via the licking of the face. To be honest, part of me was afraid the vet would offer up some pills that could\u0027ve extended her life for a few more weeks of winter. I\u0027m so glad he didn\u0027t. Long goodbyes always fill every party involved with dread. To acknowledge the end is to be strong and honest and merciful. When it\u0027s over, it\u0027s over—all you can do is toast your memories, maybe with a nice Scotch.",

they gave my dog, my parents were not alcoholics. Far from it. I&apos;m not sure we actually had any booze in the house when I was a kid, and if we did it was probably in a Notre Dame commemorative placekicker bottle, purchased from Service Merchandise with a coupon. We did have a Scotch terrier mix though, and her name was Cutty. Cutty Sark. Like the Scotch.</p><p data-reactid=".1oxyh0or668.1.1.0.0.4.2">Cutty was an adorable and slobbery wet mop known for her thick black fur, dragon breath, and scant bladder control. (Seriously, best dog ever, but if you&apos;d brought one of those hotel-room black lights to our carpet, you would have seen nothing but a minefield of long-dried puddles. If I&apos;d had girls over, it would have been a problem. It was not a problem.)</p><p data-reactid=".1oxyh0or668.1.1.0.0.4.3">There was a lot to like about Cutty: She could smile on command (though it might have been a growl; dog expressions kind of all run together), she could catch mice (which came in handy when you live in a 400-year-old house on some county road in Indiana), and she could consume an entire box of twelve chocolate Santas in one sitting, although the subsequent 24 hours are something I&apos;d like to forget. And without going all Charlie Brown-and-his-Snoopy on you she was a loyal and often damp friend to me for nearly 15 years, which is probably why it fell to me to put her down.</p><p data-reactid=".1oxyh0or668.1.1.0.0.4.5">I&apos;d left for college in the fall, and it was a welcome departure as my home (and by &quot;home&quot; I mean &quot;my mom&apos;s new condo&quot;) had fallen under a relentlessly dark post-parental divorce cloud. This entailed a lot of my mother sitting in dark rooms smoking, and my brother and I deflecting with Nintendo and also smoking. Depression being depression there was not a lot of attention to external detail going on, but it still surprised me when I came home one fall weekend to find the dog on the couch, dying.</p><p data-reactid=".1oxyh0or668.1.1.0.0.4.6">Cutty was an overcaffeinated Ewok for most of her life, and was known for greeting visitors by jumping up and down all over their legs until we could convince her to stop with a treat. Walking her could be an aerobic thrill ride; attaching her leash could be like trying to wrestle a tiny mechanical bull. This morning she didn&apos;t move. She heard the door open, turned her head and looked up at me, motionless, with huge brown eyes that said, &quot;Help.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oxyh0or668.1.1.0.0.4.7">Naturally, I panicked. Well, first I got her a treat, which was a ridiculous idea; you don&apos;t walk up to someone who&apos;s just been in a car wreck and offer them key lime pie, but it was the only thing I could think of that wasn&apos;t calling my mom at work and shouting &quot;HAS ANYONE NOTICED THAT THE DOG IS NOT MOVING?&quot; which is what I did second. My mother, from twenty miles away in a state-government office, responded that yeah, Cutty had seemed a little tired lately. (Cut to Cutty lying motionless on the couch for nine hours.)</p><p data-reactid=".1oxyh0or668.1.1.0.0.4.8">Thirty minutes later, Cutty and I were at the office of the vet, a fortysomething man with a severe close-cropped haircut. He examined the dog, produced an X-ray of an egg-sized tumor near her kidneys, and basically told me, &quot;Dude.&quot; I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s some unspoken professional rule that vets aren&apos;t allowed to explicitly advocate euthanasia, or this guy just had commitment issues. But we began a series of unbearably tense circular conversations that kept spinning around and around until they reached what was really the only logical ending for a 15-year-old dog with a huge tumor in her belly. Vets may not be able to state the obvious, but they can say things like &quot;The cost of removing the tumor from your 15-year-old dog&apos;s kidneys will be $2,400, which reminds me of a story I read in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> this morning about the cost of college&#x2026;&quot; So I ended up in an awkward staring contest trying to work up the courage to ask this man to kill my dog. It&apos;s like having a breakup conversation with a total stranger in a room full of diplomas.</p><p data-reactid=".1oxyh0or668.1.1.0.0.4.9">With the plan decided, the vet briefly returned to normal human conversation asked if I wanted a few minutes with Cutty to say my goodbyes, which I answered with a thoughtful &quot;Yrmpf?&quot; Cutty, quarantined several doors down in her lime-green exam room, totally knew what was up at this point, because when I walked in I found her suddenly full of puppy-like vigor, trying so hard to recapture her former liveliness, jumping up and down like &quot;I&apos;m fine! Look! See! I&apos;m playing! I&apos;m jumping! Look at what a vibrant companion I remain!&quot; until finally after about 10 seconds you could actually see her expression change to, &quot;I&apos;m so tired.&quot; I picked her up, and she laid her head down.</p><p data-reactid=".1oxyh0or668.1.1.0.0.4.a">And then I left. I left the vet, dragging an empty leash clinking and dragging on the sidewalk, because this vet was all about metaphors. I&apos;d been fortunate to have not experienced many actual deaths by that point, so the concept still had a grand, almost romanticized notion about it: DEATH, THE FINAL ENDING WHICH INVARIABLY GRIPS US ALL. It was dramatic, powerful, crushing. It wasn&apos;t really something that happened at 10:15 a.m. on a Thursday. I wondered all day how long it took, how long she was still alive in that weird little window between her being put to sleep and my walking out the door. Seemed like I should have stuck around. But who knows, maybe they had a schedule to keep.</p><p data-reactid=".1oxyh0or668.1.1.0.0.4.b">People spin a lot of cornball stories about cat ladies and beagle whisperers and orangutans who are Nearly Human, and I&apos;m not inclined to believe many of them. But look, if it&apos;s possible for a thought to pass from a dying animal to the mind of a dipshit college freshman, it happened, and the thought was, &quot;Make this stop.&quot; Her death was better this way, as mutual a decision as can be reached between a human and a creature that communicated mostly via the licking of the face. To be honest, part of me was afraid the vet would offer up some pills that could&apos;ve extended her life for a few more weeks of winter. I&apos;m so glad he didn&apos;t. Long goodbyes always fill every party involved with dread. To acknowledge the end is to be strong and honest and merciful. When it&apos;s over, it&apos;s over&#x2014;all you can do is toast your memories, maybe with a nice Scotch.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1oxyh0or668.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
