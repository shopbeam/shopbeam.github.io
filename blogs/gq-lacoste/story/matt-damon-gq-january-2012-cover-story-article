  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A I\u0027m ducking Matt Damon. We\u0027re supposed to meet at the Central Park Zoo ticket booth precisely at noon, but I\u0027m not there. I\u0027m thirty feet away, standing behind a huge oak tree, keeping watch.\u000A\u000A Cameron Crowe, the director, has urged me to try to get a glimpse of the 41-year-old actor when he doesn\u0027t know I\u0027m there. \u0022Matt\u0027s fans relate to him as an older brother or a member of the family. And that\u0027s how he relates to them,\u0022 Crowe says, recalling how during the shoot of their new movie, We Bought a Zoo, he liked to do reconnaissance on Damon as he signed autographs and interacted with his public.\u000A\u000A The Boston native, who now calls New York home, can be reticent in interviews, reluctant to reveal too much or get too personal. I want to observe him in his natural habitat, and I imagine that my stealth will be rewarded with the kind of unguarded moment that can only be viewed in the wild. As minutes pass, however, and I don\u0027t spot him anywhere, a thought looms: This is Jason Bourne I\u0027m hunting—the master of evasion. What if Matt Damon is ducking me?\u000A\u000A Stepping into the open, I sort of wave my notebook like a journalistic homing beacon, and suddenly there he is, all smiles. \u0022Hi, I\u0027m Matt,\u0022 he says, extending a hand. He\u0027s in jeans, a gray waffle-y long-sleeve T-shirt, and what look to be brand-new black Puma sneakers. He has a knit cap pulled down to his eyebrows, which makes it easy to notice that his hat and his eyes are exactly the same blue. He\u0027s taller than I thought he\u0027d be and exactly a quarter inch taller than the man standing next to him: a gray-haired, bespectacled guy in pleated chinos and a baseball cap.\u000A\u000A \u0022This,\u0022 Damon proclaims, \u0022is my dad.\u0022\u000A\u000A When Damon the younger pulls out a credit card to gain us entry to what we will all agree must be the smallest zoo on earth, Damon the elder (his name is Kent) observes wryly, \u0022This is the first time the son buys the father a ticket to the zoo. When has that happened before?\u0022 Whereupon the son grins big and says, \u0022There\u0027s, like, a disturbance in the Force!\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Come on,\u0022 Kent says. \u0022Let\u0027s go see the polar bears.\u0022\u000A\u000A As we set off, I\u0027m immediately struck by the constant cross-generational ball-busting between father and son. For example, the story of when 12-year-old Matt announced his intent to play point guard for the Boston Celtics.\u000A\u000AKent: I said, \u0022Matt, I have to tell you a little bit about the real world.\u0022Matt: My favorite player was Tiny Archibald, and he goes, \u0022You know they call him Tiny because he\u0027s six foot one.\u0022 He told me that he was the tallest Damon to ever evolve at five foot ten.Kent: Five ten and a half, by the way.Matt: Used to be, man.Kent: Not that we\u0027re sensitive about it.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A I mention something Crowe has told me about Damon\u0027s performance in the new film, in which he plays a widowed father of two who buys a ramshackle zoo. Crowe singles out a scene in which Damon talks to an ailing Siberian tiger through a chain-link fence. In the script, the tiger was supposed to be supine, but the minute Damon delivered his first line, the cat got up, snarling, and came toward him with menace. \u0022Most people would have said, \u0027This isn\u0027t funny—put a chain on that thing!\u0027 But Matt stays in,\u0022 Crowe told me, explaining why that first, unexpected take is the one he used in the final film. \u0022You see him flinch but stay in.\u0022\u000A\u000A Hearing this, Kent gets a mischievous look: \u0022So you were brave?\u0022\u000A\u000A Matt shakes his head and rolls his eyes. \u0022Cameron was telling stories about how I was brave in the face of a caged tiger,\u0022 he says. \u0022He was working it.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Bunch of b.s.,\u0022 agrees Kent. Which is when I realize that we may still be talking about who\u0027s the bigger man. Standing in front of a 90,000-gallon tank containing Gus, the zoo\u0027s half-ton polar bear, Matt describes borrowing a bike from his elder brother, Kyle, and discovering (when he couldn\u0027t reach the pedals) that Kyle has much longer legs. \u0022We realized if you took his lower body and my upper body, we\u0027d be, like, six foot three,\u0022 Matt tells his dad, who readily concedes that Matt is long of torso. \u0022You have a neck,\u0022 he tells his son. \u0022I don\u0027t even have a neck.\u0022 At which point, Matt nods and says simply, \u0022It\u0027s true.\u0022 If you measured the smirks on their faces, I swear they\u0027d be precisely the same size.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A When I tell the director Steven Soderbergh that I\u0027m writing this piece about Damon, he responds with faux derision: \u0022Why? He\u0027s not doing much.\u0022 (Damon was in five movies released in 2011, and he\u0027s appeared in more than thirty-five films since his breakout role as an emaciated addict in 1996\u0027s Courage Under Fire.) Soderbergh has directed his friend in six of those—Ocean\u0027s Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen; Che: Part Two; The Informant!; and Contagion—and most recently has cast him as Liberace\u0027s lover in an HBO biopic slated to shoot later this year. He calls Damon \u0022probably the least vain person in his position\u0022—meaning movie star—\u0022out there. He has no interest in protecting any sort of idea of himself as an actor.\u0022\u000A\u000A What he does have, however, is an interest in using his power as an actor to champion the underdog and right what he perceives to be wrong. He has thrown his full weight (and his money) behind a charity, Water.org, that seeks to provide sources of clean water to the Third World. Over the years, he has spoken up about public-school teachers (he supports them), the middle class (he thinks they\u0027re getting the shaft), and President Obama (he feels he\u0027s not delivering on his promise). At the White House Correspondents\u0027 dinner this year, Obama responded directly, saying, \u0022Matt Damon said he was disappointed in my performance. Well, Matt, I just saw The Adjustment Bureau...\u0022\u000A\u000A Damon tells me he didn\u0027t see that speech live but got thirty e-mails from friends the next morning and watched the president\u0027s remarks online. \u0022I have to say, it was pretty funny,\u0022 he says, getting in his own dig: \u0022Whoever came up with it, it was a terrific joke.\u0022\u000A\u000A Recently the director Michael Moore called on Damon to run for president, which he says he will never, ever do. Which may be for the best, given how explicitly he pokes fun at his own image. In appearances on late-night TV and on shows like Entourage, he seems to relish being pompous, arrogant, goofy, even profane. Tina Fey says he approached her at an awards dinner and said he\u0027d like to be considered for a cameo on 30 Rock. (\u0022We don\u0027t let people slide,\u0022 she says, \u0022once they make a mistake like that.\u0022) Whether impersonating his pal Matthew McConaughey for David Letterman (\u0022In today\u0027s scene, I think it would be a good opportunity for me to take my shirt off....\u0022) or pretending to be screwing Sarah Silverman on her then boyfriend Jimmy Kimmel\u0027s show (On the bed, on the floor, on a towel, by the door, in the tub, in the car, up against the minibar!), he seems to have an intuitive feel for comedy.\u000A\u000A \u0022A lot of stars/serious actors try to put some weird \u0027comedy sauce\u0027 on their acting. Matt doesn\u0027t put anything on it. He says the lines honestly,\u0022 says Silverman, whose Emmy-winning music video, \u0022I\u0027m Fucking Matt Damon,\u0022 nearly melted the Internet after it aired on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2008. Whether it\u0027s comedy or drama, she adds, \u0022he has that Meryl Streep thing where he always blows your mind, and you just want to watch him and watch him. He doesn\u0027t need a fancy accent or a fake tooth to play a \u0027regular person.\u0027 He just eats normal and gets a not-expensive haircut.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Scott Rudin, the ber-producer who worked with Damon on the Coen brothers\u0027 True Grit, says he\u0027s been a \u0022crazy stalker fan\u0022 since he read Good Will Hunting fifteen years ago. And Rudin\u0027s regard for Damon has only grown, he says, as he\u0027s watched the actor carve his own path through Hollywood.\u000A\u000A \u0022He\u0027s done such great things with his stardom,\u0022 Rudin says, recalling how Damon turned his nonleading role in True Grit—the buffoon with a romantic streak, LaBoeuf—into \u0022the beating heart of the movie.\u0022 There\u0027s something about Damon—a melding of his talent and his public persona—that gives him a \u0022compact with the audience,\u0022 Rudin says. \u0022And he retains it, whether every movie works or doesn\u0027t.\u0022\u000A\u000A With the Bourne franchise, which has earned more than $1 billion worldwide, he has proved his box-office clout. And then he turned his back on it, at least temporarily. What other A-lister would have walked away from the fourth Bourne film (and an estimated $20 million payday) because, he says, he and director Paul Greengrass felt that the tight timetable set by the studio would endanger its chances of being good? \u0022That\u0027s a pretty striking move,\u0022 Rudin says.\u000A\u000A Damon says they had no choice. \u0022If you look at the first three movies, we kind of pounded that idea of identity and amnesia into the ground. We really got everything out of it that we could. So to reboot it, we need to come up with something completely new,\u0022 he says, explaining why the eleven-month turnaround that Universal Pictures wanted didn\u0027t feel doable.\u000A\u000A Another Bourne film is in the works, however. Tony Gilroy, who wrote or co-wrote the first three films, has written and begun directing the fourth, The Bourne Legacy. The movie is said to exist in the same world as the previous three, but it introduces a new main character, played by Jeremy Renner. Damon says he learned about the project one day while surfing online. \u0022It was a surprise,\u0022 he says, though he doesn\u0027t sound particularly miffed. Not yet, at least.\u000A\u000A Damon tells me he thinks Gilroy is a great director (Michael Clayton, Duplicity) and that he admires Renner. And because Damon fully intends to make another Bourne movie someday, he says he\u0027s \u0022really pulling for this one, even though I don\u0027t have anything to do with it. Selfishly, it\u0027s bad for me if that movie doesn\u0027t do well.\u0022 He says he still feels \u0022inoculated\u0022 by the franchise—as if it protects him from having to do anything that could be bad for him. \u0022It feels like I can swing freely, like a baseball player—just be relad and really do the things that I want to do and not worry, because I know there\u0027s another one out there.\u0022\u000A\u000A Later, though, Damon will wonder if maybe he has become a little too relad. Because suddenly, as we sit on a bench in the afternoon sunshine, he takes a major swing at Gilroy. Damon says that back in 2001, when the first Bourne movie, The Bourne Identity, was still in postproduction, Gilroy saw a rough cut and got worried. \u0022The word on Bourne was that it was supposed to be a turkey,\u0022 Damon says. \u0022It\u0027s very rare that a movie comes out a year late, has four rounds of reshoots, and it\u0027s good. So Tony Gilroy arbitrated against himself to not be the writer with sole credit.\u0022\u000A\u000A Typically screenwriters use the Writers Guild\u0027s arbitration process when they feel they\u0027ve been denied credit unfairly. This time, Gilroy wanted to share the credit (and the blame), Damon says, \u0022to have another guy take the bullet with him.\u0022 And so someone named William Blake Herron is now cashing residual checks on Bourne, just like Gilroy is. (Actually Damon may have gotten his chronology wrong—one source says Herron initiated the credit dispute, but that Gilroy didn\u0027t oppose sharing credit.)\u000A\u000A Gilroy wrote Bourne 2 as well: The Bourne Supremacy. Then, Damon says, for The Bourne Ultimatum, the third in the franchise, Gilroy struck a deal to write just one draft of the script, take no notes, do no rewrites, and get paid \u0022an exorbitant amount of money.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022It\u0027s really the studio\u0027s fault for putting themselves in that position,\u0022 Damon says. \u0022I don\u0027t blame Tony for taking a boatload of money and handing in what he handed in. It\u0027s just that it was unreadable. This is a career-ender. I mean, I could put this thing up on eBay and it would be game over for that dude. It\u0027s terrible. It\u0027s really embarrassing. He was having a go, basically, and he took his money and left.\u0022\u000A\u000A Gilroy\u0027s lackluster work left the production in chaos, Damon says. \u0022We had a start date. Like, \u0027It\u0027s coming out August of next year.\u0027 We\u0027re like, \u0027Hang on, we\u0027ve got to figure out what the script is.\u0027 \u0022 In the end, the shooting script was written under extreme deadline pressure by George Nolfi and Scott Z. Burns, with input from Greengrass, Damon says. And then Gilroy raised another challenge. \u0022Before the movie came out, he arbitrated to get sole credit,\u0022 Damon says, disgusted. The WGA looked into it and turned Gilroy down. (He shares credit with Nolfi and Burns.) \u0022That was just a little bit of justice, I have to say,\u0022 Damon says.\u000A\u000A A representative for Gilroy referred all inquiries to Universal Pictures, where spokeswoman Kori Bernards reiterated the studio\u0027s support for both Damon and Gilroy. \u0022We could not imagine replacing Matt as Jason Bourne, which is why we\u0027re so excited Tony\u0027s script creates a fantastic new character in The Bourne Legacy and also leaves open the option for Matt to return.... Tony has done everything we\u0027ve asked of him on each of the Bourne films, and his work has been a huge asset to the franchise.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A \u0022Are you spying on me?\u0022 Damon says into his cell phone, which has just vibrated in his pocket. He\u0027s talking to his wife, Lucy, and he\u0027s also looking right at her. The petite, dark-eyed beauty is standing forty feet away, on the other side of a low fence.\u000A\u000A \u0022Do you want to see a polar bear?\u0022 he asks Lucy, his voice playful and delighted and warm as melted butter. (If he bottled that voice, lots of women would pay thousands of dollars an ounce and pour it all over themselves.) But Lucy isn\u0027t budging. Damon turns to his dad and me: \u0022She says, \u0027I\u0027ve already done the zoo.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A They met in 2003 in Miami, where Damon was shooting the Farrelly brothers comedy Stuck on You, in which he and Greg Kinnear played conjoined twins. The movie was a god-awful flop, but boy, was there an upside: Luciana Bozan, an Argentine-born bartender with a 6-year-old daughter named Alexia. Once they met, Damon—who\u0027d been romantically linked to actresses like Minnie Driver and Winona Ryder— was done looking. They married in a civil ceremony in 2005 and promptly (very promptly: Lucy was pregnant when they wed) had three more girls of their own: Isabella, now 5, Gia, 3, and Stella, 1.\u000A\u000A Meanwhile Damon and Ben Affleck, the man he calls his \u0022hetero lifemate,\u0022 remain as tight as ever. The two have a production company, Pearl Street Films, and Damon lets slip that they are developing a biopic about James \u0022Whitey\u0022 Bulger, the onetime godfather of the Irish Mob in Boston, who was on the lam for sixteen years before being apprehended last June. Damon will play Bulger and Affleck will direct. But that won\u0027t be for a while yet. First Damon must finish Elysium, a sci-fi picture directed by Neill Blomkamp, who made the acclaimed District 9.\u000A\u000A Then Damon will direct himself. Beginning sometime in early 2012, he is going into preproduction on an as-yet-untitled movie he\u0027s writing with John Krasinski, of The Office. They met and hit it off when Damon did The Adjustment Bureau with Krasinski\u0027s wife, Emily Blunt. Krasinski shared his script idea—about a salesman (Damon) who visits a small town and experiences something that changes his life—and the two started working together on the weekends while Damon was shooting We Bought a Zoo.\u000A\u000A \u0022I just found writing with him really easy—like writing with Ben,\u0022 Damon says. We\u0027ve stepped briefly into the penguin house, which smelled like you\u0027d expect a place filled with the excrement of sixty-five large birds would. (\u0022The penguins were great, by the way,\u0022 Damon said as we fled. \u0022Thank you for that.\u0022) Now we\u0027ve detoured past the red panda toward an enclosure that houses three snow leopards. As we wander, I\u0027m struck that Damon appears to approach this major career shift much like he seems to do everything else: without much apparent angst.\u000A\u000A To be sure, he is thinking a lot about how to apply the lessons he\u0027s learned during the two decades he\u0027s closely observed almost every great director alive—in addition to the ones we\u0027ve already mentioned, he\u0027s also worked with Eastwood, Redford, Scorsese, Gilliam, and Van Sant. DeNiro and Affleck have advised him, he says, on the challenges of directing and acting at the same time. Damon\u0027s not naive: He knows that if he sucks as a director, it will be a very public failure. \u0022There are just too many decisions over the course of too long a time, and if you\u0027re not a truly great director, you just can\u0027t hide,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A So why do it? \u0022When I first started getting work, I felt like acting was the most important thing,\u0022 he says. \u0022But the more you do it, the more you realize that in the end, the director has all the power.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A \u0022Clint says all the time, \u0027Let\u0027s not fuck this up too much by thinking about it,\u0027 \u0022 he says, referring to Eastwood, with whom he\u0027s done two films, one of which (Invictus) got Damon an Oscar nomination. \u0022That\u0027s his approach, and some people love it and some people hate it, but he doesn\u0027t do too much hand-wringing about it. I\u0027d love to do what Clint does.\u0022\u000A\u000A Certainly, Damon hasn\u0027t been a hand-wringer when it comes to acting. Instead of simply \u0022protecting the beachhead,\u0022 as he puts it, sticking with action roles (and cashing the big paychecks), he has used the Bourne franchise to afford him the freedom to do lower-paying, noncommercial work that he finds worthy, often in supporting parts that don\u0027t get his name at the top of the call sheet. (\u0022There are no small roles,\u0022 he explains, winking at his dad. \u0022Only small actors.\u0022) He played an energy analyst in Syriana, for example, Stephen Gaghan\u0027s 2005 drama about the forces driving the oil industry, and narrated the Oscar-winning 2010 documentary Inside Job, about the financial meltdown. For Soderbergh\u0027s The Informant!, in which he played a self-deluded whistle-blower who lies as much as he tells the truth, he gained thirty pounds, grew a doltish mustache, and wore a hairpiece. Oh, and he took a greatly reduced salary as well.\u000A\u000A \u0022I haven\u0027t made him a lot of money lately,\u0022 Soderbergh says, noting that Damon\u0027s agent, Patrick Whitesell, \u0022jokes, \u0027Whenever the phone rings from you guys, I know we\u0027re taking a haircut.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A The Ocean\u0027s movies pay pretty well, Damon insists—\u0022I think you get half your quote.\u0022 (Which, if reports can be believed, would be about $5 million for Damon.) But even in those, which ooze glamour, he plays an oddball. And that, he says, is just the way he likes it. Given his castmates, he says, it\u0027s the only way to make a splash.\u000A\u000A \u0022Look,\u0022 Damon says, \u0022if you want to try and GQ it up with George and Brad, good luck! That\u0027s pretty rarefied air, and you\u0027re not going to bring more charm than those two, so you\u0027ve got to find something else.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A We\u0027re sitting near a throng of barking sea lions when I ask if he\u0027s read A Visit from the Goon Squad. He hasn\u0027t. \u0022What is it?\u0022 he asks. \u0022I\u0027ve never heard of it.\u0022 \u0022It\u0027s Jennifer Egan\u0027s book,\u0022 I say, pulling the slender novel from my bag. \u0022It won the Pulitzer this year.\u0022\u000A\u000A He laughs. \u0022I\u0027m like, \u0027I\u0027ve never heard of it.\u0027 You\u0027re like, \u0027Well, it won the Pulitzer, dumb-ass.\u0027 \u0022 I explain that I brought the novel not to shame him, although that\u0027s kind of fun, but to show him a chapter that spoofs the very thing we\u0027re doing: a celebrity interview. In addition to being hilarious, the fake magazine profile in Egan\u0027s book—it\u0027s about a made-up actress named Kitty Jackson—drops a few real names, including Damon\u0027s. Kitty is said to belong \u0022in the category of nice stars (Matt Damon) rather than of difficult stars (Ralph Fiennes). Stars in the nice category act as if they\u0027re just like you (i.e., me) so that you will like them and write flattering things about them, a strategy that is almost universally successful....\u0022\u000A\u000A I hand Damon the book. Keep it, I say. I don\u0027t tell him that in it, the journalist ends up trying to rape the celebrity-profile subject—in Central Park, no less. I don\u0027t reveal the book\u0027s suggestion that celebrity profilers are, metaphorically at least, having their way with their subjects. Because that would be kind of like saying that while interviewing Matt Damon, I\u0027m also fucking Matt Damon. And as we all know, Sarah Silverman got there first. Here, Damon and Silverman on the making of \u0022I\u0027m Fucking Matt Damon.\u0022\u000A\u000AMatt: Jimmy Kimmel and I had this kind of fake feud going.Sarah: Every night at the end of &gt; Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Jimmy would say, \u0022Sorry, Matt Damon, we ran out of time\u0022—a joke that started because in the early years of Jimmy\u0027s show, the lead guest would be, like, the man with the longest leg hair in the world.Matt: So the producers called me up and said, \u0022Would you ever consider coming on and we\u0027ll do a bit? We\u0027ll finally get you on, and then we\u0027ll run out of time, and then you and Jimmy\u0027ll do a whole fake fight.\u0022 And I was like, \u0022Oh, that\u0027s funny.\u0022 So I came on, and I did this whole fake fight with him as they\u0027re rolling the credits. And then we did a thing for &gt; The Bourne Ultimatum in 2007, a fake trailer in which Guillermo [the security guard who has become a regular on Kimmel\u0027s show] ends up in my movie, and I say, \u0022Wait, now you\u0027re trying to bump me from my own &gt; movie?\u0022 Then the question was, How do we beat that?Sarah: For Jimmy\u0027s fortieth birthday, the plan was to have a show where all the guests and bits were a surprise.Matt: Sarah was going to come out and say, \u0022Well, happy birthday, but there is this one thing that I should probably tell you.\u0022Sarah: Two writers, Tony Barbieri and Sal Iacono, had the idea that it should be a song.Matt: We shot it really quickly. I was in Miami, and I think we met at the Delano Hotel at seven in the morning, and we were done by ten. It was a tiny production: one camera, a couple of backup dancers. We recorded the song in the closet. They put sound blankets in there and a microphone, and I recorded my part. After it was over, I had to go to a parent-teacher conference for Alexia, and I was like, \u0022What the fuck did I just do? Holy shit. I can\u0027t do this shit anymore. I have kids. This is crazy. They\u0027re going to see this.\u0022Sarah: The video was actually shelved for many months because of the writers\u0027 strike. We dusted it off and aired it on Jimmy\u0027s five-year-anniversary show instead. I remember that night: Jimmy and I were brushing our teeth before the show, and he was like, \u0022I\u0027m so excited for your surprise—I hear it\u0027s great!\u0022 I didn\u0027t want him to psych himself up too much, so I was like, \u0022It\u0027s a \u0027funny video,\u0027 you know?\u0022 Jimmy loved it, which was nice.Matt: After the thing ran, I went to pick Alexia up at school, and one of the teachers came out and had seen it and said, \u0022Oh, it was great, it was really good,\u0022 and then I realized, \u0022Okay, it\u0027s okay.\u0022Sarah: The fact that it became this viral thing was very unexpected. It\u0027s funny—though our names will forever be linked, I really don\u0027t know him personally. I mean, if I see him somewhere, he gives me a warm hug and hello, but I don\u0027t have his phone number or anything.\u000A\u000A Apparently, Damon doesn\u0027t just collect famous friends. Which makes sense, since his relationship with his own celebrity has been fraught. While he understands that profiles like this one play a part in marketing his films, he has at times been difficult when interviewers have tried to talk about anything more personal than global politics or film theory. The last time this magazine profiled him, in 2007, the writer resorted to describing the \u0022excruciatingly long and loud—like, racehorse long-and-loud—piss\u0022 he took in a trailer lavatory, because \u0022it was the most interesting thing he did over the course of...three hours.\u0022\u000A\u000A Crowe has a theory about Damon\u0027s elusiveness. \u0022Matt\u0027s a guy who skewers pretension. Hourly and by the minute, nothing is going to get pumped up into some lofty thing with Matt around,\u0022 the director says. \u0022It may not be as subversive as him trying to be tricky about not letting the interviewer get to him. It\u0027s more that he would skewer the guy that you mostly read in celebrity interviews. He laughs at that guy. He\u0027s very careful to not be that guy.\u0022\u000A\u000A With me, he hasn\u0027t been that guy. He\u0027s been forthcoming—way more forthcoming, he already realizes, than he meant to be. Damon has very pointedly skewered someone—Gilroy—who he feels unfairly pumped himself up. And he regrets it. As this story is going to press, he\u0027ll call me to clarify: \u0022If I didn\u0027t respect him and appreciate his talent, then I really wouldn\u0027t have cared.... My feelings were hurt. That\u0027s all. And that\u0027s exactly why I shouldn\u0027t have said anything. This is between me and him. So saying anything publicly is fucking stupid and unprofessional and just kind of douchey of me.\u0022\u000A\u000A But that will come later. Now, at the zoo, his phone buzzes—his wife again. It\u0027s time to pick up their daughters from school, so Damon, his dad, and I head for the exit. There we meet up with Lucy, and we all walk briskly east, toward a huge chauffeured black Yukon XL that waits to whisk them away. Before we can get to it, though, a paparazzo suddenly charges toward us, his camera raised. He\u0027s not exactly menacing, but he\u0027s persistent, trying to herd Damon and his family into a single frame. Most movie stars of Damon\u0027s stature would have said, \u0022This isn\u0027t funny—put a chain on that thing!\u0022 But Damon smiles a tight smile. \u0022Here,\u0022 he says politely, \u0022you can take a shot of me and my pop.\u0022 Damon stays in. You see him flinch, but he stays in.\u000A\u000A Amy Wallace is a GQ correspondent.",

I&apos;m thirty feet away, standing behind a huge oak tree, keeping watch.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.2"> Cameron Crowe, the director, has urged me to try to get a glimpse of the 41-year-old actor when he doesn&apos;t know I&apos;m there. &quot;Matt&apos;s fans relate to him as an older brother or a member of the family. And that&apos;s how he relates to them,&quot; Crowe says, recalling how during the shoot of their new movie, <em>We Bought a Zoo</em>, he liked to do reconnaissance on Damon as he signed autographs and interacted with his public.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.3"> The Boston native, who now calls New York home, can be reticent in interviews, reluctant to reveal too much or get too personal. I want to observe him in his natural habitat, and I imagine that my stealth will be rewarded with the kind of unguarded moment that can only be viewed in the wild. As minutes pass, however, and I don&apos;t spot him anywhere, a thought looms: This is Jason Bourne I&apos;m hunting&#x2014;the master of evasion. What if Matt Damon is ducking me?</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.5"> Stepping into the open, I sort of wave my notebook like a journalistic homing beacon, and suddenly there he is, all smiles. &quot;Hi, I&apos;m Matt,&quot; he says, extending a hand. He&apos;s in jeans, a gray waffle-y long-sleeve T-shirt, and what look to be brand-new black Puma sneakers. He has a knit cap pulled down to his eyebrows, which makes it easy to notice that his hat and his eyes are exactly the same blue. He&apos;s taller than I thought he&apos;d be and exactly a quarter inch taller than the man standing next to him: a gray-haired, bespectacled guy in pleated chinos and a baseball cap.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.6"> &quot;This,&quot; Damon proclaims, &quot;is my dad.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.7"> When Damon the younger pulls out a credit card to gain us entry to what we will all agree must be the smallest zoo on earth, Damon the elder (his name is Kent) observes wryly, &quot;This is the first time the son buys the father a ticket to the zoo. When has <em>that</em> happened before?&quot; Whereupon the son grins big and says, &quot;There&apos;s, like, a disturbance in the Force!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.8"> &quot;Come on,&quot; Kent says. &quot;Let&apos;s go see the polar bears.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.9"> As we set off, I&apos;m immediately struck by the constant cross-generational ball-busting between father and son. For example, the story of when 12-year-old Matt announced his intent to play point guard for the Boston Celtics.</p><div class="embed blockquote" data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.a"><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Kent: </strong>I said, &quot;Matt, I have to tell you a little bit about the real world.&quot;</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>My favorite player was Tiny Archibald, and he goes, &quot;You know they call him Tiny because he&apos;s six foot one.&quot; He told me that he was the tallest Damon to ever evolve at five foot ten.</p><p><strong>Kent: </strong>Five ten and a half, by the way.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Used to be, man.</p><p><strong>Kent: </strong>Not that we&apos;re sensitive about it.</p></blockquote></blockquote></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.b"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d1491177d66d68d5a3b1/master/w_806/style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-director-inset.jpg" alt="style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-director-inset.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmatt-damon-gq-january-2012-cover-story-article&amp;t=style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-director-inset.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmatt-damon-gq-january-2012-cover-story-article&amp;t=style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-director-inset.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmatt-damon-gq-january-2012-cover-story-article&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d1491177d66d68d5a3b1%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-director-inset.jpg&amp;description=style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-director-inset.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmatt-damon-gq-january-2012-cover-story-article&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d1491177d66d68d5a3b1%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-director-inset.jpg&amp;description=style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-director-inset.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.c"> I mention something Crowe has told me about Damon&apos;s performance in the new film, in which he plays a widowed father of two who buys a ramshackle zoo. Crowe singles out a scene in which Damon talks to an ailing Siberian tiger through a chain-link fence. In the script, the tiger was supposed to be supine, but the minute Damon delivered his first line, the cat got up, snarling, and came toward him with menace. &quot;Most people would have said, &apos;This isn&apos;t funny&#x2014;put a chain on that thing!&apos; But Matt stays in,&quot; Crowe told me, explaining why that first, unexpected take is the one he used in the final film. &quot;You see him flinch but stay in.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Hearing this, Kent gets a mischievous look: &quot;So you were brave?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.e"> Matt shakes his head and rolls his eyes. &quot;Cameron was telling stories about how I was brave in the face of a caged tiger,&quot; he says. &quot;He was working it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.f"> &quot;Bunch of b.s.,&quot; agrees Kent. Which is when I realize that we may still be talking about who&apos;s the bigger man. Standing in front of a 90,000-gallon tank containing Gus, the zoo&apos;s half-ton polar bear, Matt describes borrowing a bike from his elder brother, Kyle, and discovering (when he couldn&apos;t reach the pedals) that Kyle has much longer legs. &quot;We realized if you took his lower body and my upper body, we&apos;d be, like, six foot three,&quot; Matt tells his dad, who readily concedes that Matt is long of torso. &quot;You have a neck,&quot; he tells his son. &quot;I don&apos;t even have a neck.&quot; At which point, Matt nods and says simply, &quot;It&apos;s true.&quot; If you measured the smirks on their faces, I swear they&apos;d be precisely the same size.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.g">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.h"> When I tell the director Steven Soderbergh that I&apos;m writing this piece about Damon, he responds with faux derision: &quot;Why? He&apos;s not doing much.&quot; (Damon was in <em>five</em> movies released in 2011, and he&apos;s appeared in more than thirty-five films since his breakout role as an emaciated addict in 1996&apos;s <em>Courage Under Fire</em>.) Soderbergh has directed his friend in six of those&#x2014;<em>Ocean&apos;s Eleven, Twelve</em>, and <em>Thirteen</em>; <em>Che: Part Two</em>; <em>The Informant!</em>; and <em>Contagion</em>&#x2014;and most recently has cast him as Liberace&apos;s lover in an HBO biopic slated to shoot later this year. He calls Damon &quot;probably the least vain person in his position&quot;&#x2014;meaning movie star&#x2014;&quot;out there. He has no interest in protecting any sort of idea of himself as an actor.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.i"> What he does have, however, is an interest in using his power as an actor to champion the underdog and right what he perceives to be wrong. He has thrown his full weight (and his money) behind a charity, Water.org, that seeks to provide sources of clean water to the Third World. Over the years, he has spoken up about public-school teachers (he supports them), the middle class (he thinks they&apos;re getting the shaft), and President Obama (he feels he&apos;s not delivering on his promise). At the White House Correspondents&apos; dinner this year, Obama responded directly, saying, &quot;Matt Damon said he was disappointed in my performance. Well, Matt, I just saw <em>The Adjustment Bureau</em>...&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.j"> Damon tells me he didn&apos;t see that speech live but got thirty e-mails from friends the next morning and watched the president&apos;s remarks online. &quot;I have to say, it was pretty funny,&quot; he says, getting in his own dig: &quot;Whoever came up with it, it was a terrific joke.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.k"> Recently the director Michael Moore called on Damon to run for president, which he says he will never, ever do. Which may be for the best, given how explicitly he pokes fun at his own image. In appearances on late-night TV and on shows like <em>Entourage</em>, he seems to relish being pompous, arrogant, goofy, even profane. Tina Fey says he approached her at an awards dinner and said he&apos;d like to be considered for a cameo on <em>30 Rock</em>. (&quot;We don&apos;t let people slide,&quot; she says, &quot;once they make a mistake like that.&quot;) Whether impersonating his pal Matthew McConaughey for David Letterman (&quot;In today&apos;s scene, I think it would be a good opportunity for me to take my shirt off....&quot;) or pretending to be screwing Sarah Silverman on her then boyfriend Jimmy Kimmel&apos;s show (<em>On the bed, on the floor, on a towel, by the door, in the tub, in the car, up against the minibar!</em>), he seems to have an intuitive feel for comedy.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.l"> &quot;A lot of stars/serious actors try to put some weird &apos;comedy sauce&apos; on their acting. Matt doesn&apos;t put anything on it. He says the lines honestly,&quot; says Silverman, whose Emmy-winning music video, &quot;I&apos;m Fucking Matt Damon,&quot; nearly melted the Internet after it aired on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em> in 2008. Whether it&apos;s comedy or drama, she adds, &quot;he has that Meryl Streep thing where he always blows your mind, and you just want to watch him and watch him. He doesn&apos;t need a fancy accent or a fake tooth to play a &apos;regular person.&apos; He just eats normal and gets a not-expensive haircut.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.m">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.n"> Scott Rudin, the ber-producer who worked with Damon on the Coen brothers&apos; <em>True Grit</em>, says he&apos;s been a &quot;crazy stalker fan&quot; since he read <em>Good Will Hunting</em> fifteen years ago. And Rudin&apos;s regard for Damon has only grown, he says, as he&apos;s watched the actor carve his own path through Hollywood.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.o"> &quot;He&apos;s done such great things with his stardom,&quot; Rudin says, recalling how Damon turned his nonleading role in <em>True Grit</em>&#x2014;the buffoon with a romantic streak, LaBoeuf&#x2014;into &quot;the beating heart of the movie.&quot; There&apos;s something about Damon&#x2014;a melding of his talent and his public persona&#x2014;that gives him a &quot;compact with the audience,&quot; Rudin says. &quot;And he retains it, whether every movie works or doesn&apos;t.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.p"> With the Bourne franchise, which has earned more than $1 billion worldwide, he has proved his box-office clout. And then he turned his back on it, at least temporarily. What other A-lister would have walked away from the fourth Bourne film (and an estimated $20 million payday) because, he says, he and director Paul Greengrass felt that the tight timetable set by the studio would endanger its chances of being good? &quot;That&apos;s a pretty striking move,&quot; Rudin says.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.q"> Damon says they had no choice. &quot;If you look at the first three movies, we kind of pounded that idea of identity and amnesia into the ground. We really got everything out of it that we could. So to reboot it, we need to come up with something completely new,&quot; he says, explaining why the eleven-month turnaround that Universal Pictures wanted didn&apos;t feel doable.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.r"> Another Bourne film is in the works, however. Tony Gilroy, who wrote or co-wrote the first three films, has written and begun directing the fourth, <em>The Bourne Legacy</em>. The movie is said to exist in the same world as the previous three, but it introduces a new main character, played by Jeremy Renner. Damon says he learned about the project one day while surfing online. &quot;It was a surprise,&quot; he says, though he doesn&apos;t sound particularly miffed. Not yet, at least.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.s"> Damon tells me he thinks Gilroy is a great director (<em>Michael Clayton, Duplicity</em>) and that he admires Renner. And because Damon fully intends to make another Bourne movie someday, he says he&apos;s &quot;really pulling for this one, even though I don&apos;t have anything to do with it. Selfishly, it&apos;s bad for me if that movie doesn&apos;t do well.&quot; He says he still feels &quot;inoculated&quot; by the franchise&#x2014;as if it protects him from having to do anything that could be bad for him. &quot;It feels like I can swing freely, like a baseball player&#x2014;just be relad and really do the things that I want to do and not worry, because I know there&apos;s another one out there.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.t"> Later, though, Damon will wonder if maybe he has become a little <em>too</em> relad. Because suddenly, as we sit on a bench in the afternoon sunshine, he takes a major swing at Gilroy. Damon says that back in 2001, when the first Bourne movie, <em>The Bourne Identity</em>, was still in postproduction, Gilroy saw a rough cut and got worried. &quot;The word on <em>Bourne</em> was that it was supposed to be a turkey,&quot; Damon says. &quot;It&apos;s very rare that a movie comes out a year late, has four rounds of reshoots, and it&apos;s good. So Tony Gilroy arbitrated against himself to not be the writer with sole credit.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.u"> Typically screenwriters use the Writers Guild&apos;s arbitration process when they feel they&apos;ve been denied credit unfairly. This time, Gilroy wanted to share the credit (and the blame), Damon says, &quot;to have another guy take the bullet with him.&quot; And so someone named William Blake Herron is now cashing residual checks on <em>Bourne</em>, just like Gilroy is. (Actually Damon may have gotten his chronology wrong&#x2014;one source says Herron initiated the credit dispute, but that Gilroy didn&apos;t oppose sharing credit.)</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.v"> Gilroy wrote Bourne 2 as well: <em>The Bourne Supremacy</em>. Then, Damon says, for <em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em>, the third in the franchise, Gilroy struck a deal to write just one draft of the script, take no notes, do no rewrites, and get paid &quot;an exorbitant amount of money.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.w"> &quot;It&apos;s really the studio&apos;s fault for putting themselves in that position,&quot; Damon says. &quot;I don&apos;t blame Tony for taking a boatload of money and handing in what he handed in. It&apos;s just that it was unreadable. This is a career-ender. I mean, I could put this thing up on eBay and it would be game over for that dude. It&apos;s terrible. It&apos;s really embarrassing. He was having a go, basically, and he took his money and left.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.x"> Gilroy&apos;s lackluster work left the production in chaos, Damon says. &quot;We had a start date. Like, &apos;It&apos;s coming out August of next year.&apos; We&apos;re like, &apos;Hang on, we&apos;ve got to figure out what the script is.&apos; &quot; In the end, the shooting script was written under extreme deadline pressure by George Nolfi and Scott Z. Burns, with input from Greengrass, Damon says. And then Gilroy raised another challenge. &quot;Before the movie came out, he arbitrated to get <em>sole</em> credit,&quot; Damon says, disgusted. The WGA looked into it and turned Gilroy down. (He shares credit with Nolfi and Burns.) &quot;That was just a little bit of justice, I have to say,&quot; Damon says.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.y"> A representative for Gilroy referred all inquiries to Universal Pictures, where spokeswoman Kori Bernards reiterated the studio&apos;s support for both Damon and Gilroy. &quot;We could not imagine replacing Matt as Jason Bourne, which is why we&apos;re so excited Tony&apos;s script creates a fantastic new character in <em>The Bourne Legacy</em> and also leaves open the option for Matt to return.... Tony has done everything we&apos;ve asked of him on each of the Bourne films, and his work has been a huge asset to the franchise.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.z">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.10"> &quot;Are you spying on me?&quot; Damon says into his cell phone, which has just vibrated in his pocket. He&apos;s talking to his wife, Lucy, and he&apos;s also looking right at her. The petite, dark-eyed beauty is standing forty feet away, on the other side of a low fence.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.11"> &quot;Do you want to see a polar bear?&quot; he asks Lucy, his voice playful and delighted and warm as melted butter. (If he bottled that voice, lots of women would pay thousands of dollars an ounce and pour it all over themselves.) But Lucy isn&apos;t budging. Damon turns to his dad and me: &quot;She says, &apos;I&apos;ve already done the zoo.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.12"> They met in 2003 in Miami, where Damon was shooting the Farrelly brothers comedy <em>Stuck on You</em>, in which he and Greg Kinnear played conjoined twins. The movie was a god-awful flop, but boy, was there an upside: Luciana Bozan, an Argentine-born bartender with a 6-year-old daughter named Alexia. Once they met, Damon&#x2014;who&apos;d been romantically linked to actresses like Minnie Driver and Winona Ryder&#x2014; was done looking. They married in a civil ceremony in 2005 and promptly (very promptly: Lucy was pregnant when they wed) had three more girls of their own: Isabella, now 5, Gia, 3, and Stella, 1.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.13"> Meanwhile Damon and Ben Affleck, the man he calls his &quot;hetero lifemate,&quot; remain as tight as ever. The two have a production company, Pearl Street Films, and Damon lets slip that they are developing a biopic about James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger, the onetime godfather of the Irish Mob in Boston, who was on the lam for sixteen years before being apprehended last June. Damon will play Bulger and Affleck will direct. But that won&apos;t be for a while yet. First Damon must finish <em>Elysium</em>, a sci-fi picture directed by Neill Blomkamp, who made the acclaimed <em>District 9</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.14"> Then Damon will direct himself. Beginning sometime in early 2012, he is going into preproduction on an as-yet-untitled movie he&apos;s writing with John Krasinski, of <em>The Office</em>. They met and hit it off when Damon did <em>The Adjustment Bureau</em> with Krasinski&apos;s wife, Emily Blunt. Krasinski shared his script idea&#x2014;about a salesman (Damon) who visits a small town and experiences something that changes his life&#x2014;and the two started working together on the weekends while Damon was shooting <em>We Bought a Zoo</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.15"> &quot;I just found writing with him really easy&#x2014;like writing with Ben,&quot; Damon says. We&apos;ve stepped briefly into the penguin house, which smelled like you&apos;d expect a place filled with the excrement of sixty-five large birds would. (&quot;The penguins were great, by the way,&quot; Damon said as we fled. &quot;Thank you for that.&quot;) Now we&apos;ve detoured past the red panda toward an enclosure that houses three snow leopards. As we wander, I&apos;m struck that Damon appears to approach this major career shift much like he seems to do everything else: without much apparent angst.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.16"> To be sure, he is thinking a lot about how to apply the lessons he&apos;s learned during the two decades he&apos;s closely observed almost every great director alive&#x2014;in addition to the ones we&apos;ve already mentioned, he&apos;s also worked with Eastwood, Redford, Scorsese, Gilliam, and Van Sant. DeNiro and Affleck have advised him, he says, on the challenges of directing and acting at the same time. Damon&apos;s not naive: He knows that if he sucks as a director, it will be a very public failure. &quot;There are just too many decisions over the course of too long a time, and if you&apos;re not a truly great director, you just can&apos;t hide,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.17"> So why do it? &quot;When I first started getting work, I felt like acting was the most important thing,&quot; he says. &quot;But the more you do it, the more you realize that in the end, the director has all the power.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.18"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d1491177d66d68d5a3b3/master/w_806/style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-actors-inset.jpg" alt="style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-actors-inset.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmatt-damon-gq-january-2012-cover-story-article&amp;t=style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-actors-inset.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmatt-damon-gq-january-2012-cover-story-article&amp;t=style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-actors-inset.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmatt-damon-gq-january-2012-cover-story-article&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d1491177d66d68d5a3b3%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-actors-inset.jpg&amp;description=style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-actors-inset.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmatt-damon-gq-january-2012-cover-story-article&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d1491177d66d68d5a3b3%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-actors-inset.jpg&amp;description=style-2012-matt-damon-matt-damon-small-actors-inset.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.19"> &quot;Clint says all the time, &apos;Let&apos;s not fuck this up too much by thinking about it,&apos; &quot; he says, referring to Eastwood, with whom he&apos;s done two films, one of which (<em>Invictus</em>) got Damon an Oscar nomination. &quot;That&apos;s his approach, and some people love it and some people hate it, but he doesn&apos;t do too much hand-wringing about it. I&apos;d love to do what Clint does.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> Certainly, Damon hasn&apos;t been a hand-wringer when it comes to acting. Instead of simply &quot;protecting the beachhead,&quot; as he puts it, sticking with action roles (and cashing the big paychecks), he has used the Bourne franchise to afford him the freedom to do lower-paying, noncommercial work that he finds worthy, often in supporting parts that don&apos;t get his name at the top of the call sheet. (&quot;There are no small roles,&quot; he explains, winking at his dad. &quot;Only small actors.&quot;) He played an energy analyst in <em>Syriana</em>, for example, Stephen Gaghan&apos;s 2005 drama about the forces driving the oil industry, and narrated the Oscar-winning 2010 documentary <em>Inside Job</em>, about the financial meltdown. For Soderbergh&apos;s <em>The Informant!</em>, in which he played a self-deluded whistle-blower who lies as much as he tells the truth, he gained thirty pounds, grew a doltish mustache, and wore a hairpiece. Oh, and he took a greatly reduced salary as well.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> &quot;I haven&apos;t made him a lot of money lately,&quot; Soderbergh says, noting that Damon&apos;s agent, Patrick Whitesell, &quot;jokes, &apos;Whenever the phone rings from you guys, I know we&apos;re taking a haircut.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> The <em>Ocean&apos;s</em> movies pay pretty well, Damon insists&#x2014;&quot;I think you get half your quote.&quot; (Which, if reports can be believed, would be about $5 million for Damon.) But even in those, which ooze glamour, he plays an oddball. And that, he says, is just the way he likes it. Given his castmates, he says, it&apos;s the only way to make a splash.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> &quot;Look,&quot; Damon says, &quot;if you want to try and <em>GQ</em> it up with George and Brad, good luck! That&apos;s pretty rarefied air, and you&apos;re not going to bring more charm than those two, so you&apos;ve got to find something else.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1e">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> We&apos;re sitting near a throng of barking sea lions when I ask if he&apos;s read <em>A Visit from the Goon Squad</em>. He hasn&apos;t. &quot;What is it?&quot; he asks. &quot;I&apos;ve never heard of it.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s Jennifer Egan&apos;s book,&quot; I say, pulling the slender novel from my bag. &quot;It won the Pulitzer this year.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> He laughs. &quot;I&apos;m like, &apos;I&apos;ve never heard of it.&apos; You&apos;re like, &apos;Well, it won the Pulitzer, <em>dumb-ass</em>.&apos; &quot; I explain that I brought the novel not to shame him, although that&apos;s kind of fun, but to show him a chapter that spoofs the very thing we&apos;re doing: a celebrity interview. In addition to being hilarious, the fake magazine profile in Egan&apos;s book&#x2014;it&apos;s about a made-up actress named Kitty Jackson&#x2014;drops a few real names, including Damon&apos;s. Kitty is said to belong &quot;in the category of nice stars (Matt Damon) rather than of difficult stars (Ralph Fiennes). Stars in the nice category act as if they&apos;re just like you (i.e., me) so that you will like them and write flattering things about them, a strategy that is almost universally successful....&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1h"> I hand Damon the book. Keep it, I say. I don&apos;t tell him that in it, the journalist ends up trying to rape the celebrity-profile subject&#x2014;in Central Park, no less. I don&apos;t reveal the book&apos;s suggestion that celebrity profilers are, metaphorically at least, having their way with their subjects. Because that would be kind of like saying that while interviewing Matt Damon, I&apos;m also fucking Matt Damon. And as we all know, Sarah Silverman got there first. Here, Damon and Silverman on the making of &quot;I&apos;m Fucking Matt Damon.&quot;</p><div class="embed blockquote" data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1i"><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Jimmy Kimmel and I had this kind of fake feud going.</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>Every night at the end of &gt; <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</em>, Jimmy would say, &quot;Sorry, Matt Damon, we ran out of time&quot;&#x2014;a joke that started because in the early years of Jimmy&apos;s show, the lead guest would be, like, the man with the longest leg hair in the world.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>So the producers called me up and said, &quot;Would you ever consider coming on and we&apos;ll do a bit? We&apos;ll finally get you on, and then we&apos;ll run out of time, and then you and Jimmy&apos;ll do a whole fake fight.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Oh, that&apos;s funny.&quot; So I came on, and I did this whole fake fight with him as they&apos;re rolling the credits. And then we did a thing for &gt; <em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em> in 2007, a fake trailer in which Guillermo [the security guard who has become a regular on Kimmel&apos;s show] ends up in my movie, and I say, &quot;Wait, now you&apos;re trying to bump me from my own &gt; <em>movie?</em>&quot; Then the question was, How do we beat that?</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>For Jimmy&apos;s fortieth birthday, the plan was to have a show where all the guests and bits were a surprise.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>Sarah was going to come out and say, &quot;Well, happy birthday, but there is this one thing that I should probably tell you.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>Two writers, Tony Barbieri and Sal Iacono, had the idea that it should be a song.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>We shot it really quickly. I was in Miami, and I think we met at the Delano Hotel at seven in the morning, and we were done by ten. It was a tiny production: one camera, a couple of backup dancers. We recorded the song in the closet. They put sound blankets in there and a microphone, and I recorded my part. After it was over, I had to go to a parent-teacher conference for Alexia, and I was like, &quot;What the fuck did I just do? Holy shit. I can&apos;t do this shit anymore. I have kids. This is crazy. They&apos;re going to see this.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>The video was actually shelved for many months because of the writers&apos; strike. We dusted it off and aired it on Jimmy&apos;s five-year-anniversary show instead. I remember that night: Jimmy and I were brushing our teeth before the show, and he was like, &quot;I&apos;m so excited for your surprise&#x2014;I hear it&apos;s great!&quot; I didn&apos;t want him to psych himself up too much, so I was like, &quot;It&apos;s a &apos;funny video,&apos; you know?&quot; Jimmy loved it, which was nice.</p><p><strong>Matt: </strong>After the thing ran, I went to pick Alexia up at school, and one of the teachers came out and had seen it and said, &quot;Oh, it was great, it was really good,&quot; and then I realized, &quot;Okay, it&apos;s okay.&quot;</p><p><strong>Sarah: </strong>The fact that it became this viral thing was very unexpected. It&apos;s funny&#x2014;though our names will forever be linked, I really don&apos;t know him personally. I mean, if I see him somewhere, he gives me a warm hug and hello, but I don&apos;t have his phone number or anything.</p></blockquote></blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1j"> Apparently, Damon doesn&apos;t just collect famous friends. Which makes sense, since his relationship with his own celebrity has been fraught. While he understands that profiles like this one play a part in marketing his films, he has at times been difficult when interviewers have tried to talk about anything more personal than global politics or film theory. The last time this magazine profiled him, in 2007, the writer resorted to describing the &quot;excruciatingly long and loud&#x2014;like, racehorse long-and-loud&#x2014;piss&quot; he took in a trailer lavatory, because &quot;it was the most interesting thing he did over the course of...three hours.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1k"> Crowe has a theory about Damon&apos;s elusiveness. &quot;Matt&apos;s a guy who skewers pretension. Hourly and by the minute, nothing is going to get pumped up into some lofty thing with Matt around,&quot; the director says. &quot;It may not be as subversive as him trying to be tricky about not letting the interviewer get to him. It&apos;s more that he would skewer the guy that you mostly read in celebrity interviews. He laughs at that guy. He&apos;s very careful to not be that guy.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1l"> With me, he hasn&apos;t been that guy. He&apos;s been forthcoming&#x2014;way more forthcoming, he already realizes, than he meant to be. Damon has very pointedly skewered someone&#x2014;Gilroy&#x2014;who he feels unfairly pumped himself up. And he regrets it. As this story is going to press, he&apos;ll call me to clarify: &quot;If I didn&apos;t respect him and appreciate his talent, then I really wouldn&apos;t have cared.... My feelings were hurt. That&apos;s all. And that&apos;s exactly why I shouldn&apos;t have said anything. This is between me and him. So saying anything publicly is fucking stupid and unprofessional and just kind of douchey of me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1m"> But that will come later. Now, at the zoo, his phone buzzes&#x2014;his wife again. It&apos;s time to pick up their daughters from school, so Damon, his dad, and I head for the exit. There we meet up with Lucy, and we all walk briskly east, toward a huge chauffeured black Yukon XL that waits to whisk them away. Before we can get to it, though, a paparazzo suddenly charges toward us, his camera raised. He&apos;s not exactly menacing, but he&apos;s persistent, trying to herd Damon and his family into a single frame. Most movie stars of Damon&apos;s stature would have said, &quot;This isn&apos;t funny&#x2014;put a chain on that thing!&quot; But Damon smiles a tight smile. &quot;Here,&quot; he says politely, &quot;you can take a shot of me and my pop.&quot; Damon stays in. You see him flinch, but he stays in.</p><p data-reactid=".27lg8w65xq8.1.1.0.0.4.1n"> <em>Amy Wallace is a </em>GQ<em> correspondent. </em></p></div><div class="grid"
