  	    "articleBody": "Or is this precisely what we get when we pay to watch Floyd Mayweather box\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ALet\u0027s be honest: The appeal of boxing, to the average casual fan, is to watch two people beat the shit out of each other. We can try to claim all we want that it\u0027s the personalities, it\u0027s the spectacle, it\u0027s the sweet science of the thing. We are lying. We tune in to see a guy get punched in the goddamned face.\u000A\u000ASuffice it to say, this is not why bors find boxing appealing. Oh, they adore inflicting pain on other men; who wouldn\u0027t? But to them, all told, the-repeated-blows-to-the-head deal— the one that makes us rise out of our seats and begin to snarl and bray— is one they\u0027d rather just avoid. The great bors, the truly legendary ones, become so because of their ability to dodge violence as much as their ability to mete it out.\u000A\u000AFloyd Mayweather is the perfect example of this. He is one of the greatest bors of all time primarily because his fights are so endlessly frustrating to watch. Mayweather\u0027s strength as a bor is his ability to defend and to control the pace of a fight: No matter what his opponent wants to do, Mayweather is able to keep him from it. When Mayweather, so tactically brilliant, figures out the way to make certain you can\u0027t cause him any real damage, he just implements that strategy over and over and over until he wins. He doesn\u0027t care if he knocks you out; as a genetically modified offspring of Mayweather and Crash Davis might put it, \u0022Knockouts are Fascist.\u0022 Mayweather\u0027s goal is protect his undefeated record and take home as much as cash as possible. You don\u0027t do that by looking for the big hit. You do that by monotonously pressing your advantage until the fight is over.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s masterful, and smart: It\u0027s also an excellent way to avoid being punched in the face, which is wonderful for Floyd Mayweather. (Floyd Mayweather is someone you desperately want to see punched... but just can\u0027t.) But as you well know after watching the much-hyped, destined-to-be-Al-Capone\u0027s-vault-ed Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fight last night: It is boring as all hell to watch. I\u0027m sure boxing diehards loved it: They see the technique and the schematics behind Mayweather\u0027s domination of Pacquaio. And I get it: When I watch Mayweather fight, I feel like I learn so much more about boxing, about movement and reach and feints and counterpunching and everything else that goes into this sport. But I don\u0027t care about those things. I could care less about how the sausage is made; I just want to see the sausage get pounded. That\u0027s what I, and all of you, came here for.\u000A\u000AThe thing about this is that this is awful. We\u0027re running NFL commissioner Roger Goodell through the ringer every time we see him because of his league\u0027s seeming disinterest in his player\u0027s long-term health, but deep down, we\u0027re lying, to him, and ourselves. If we truly cared about those players\u0027 brains, we\u0027d stop watching them bash them into one another for our entertainment. But boxing is worse: Head injuries are a byproduct in the NFL, but in boxing, they are the product. You can\u0027t hide in boxing, claiming you just enjoy a safer sport, something I suspect people claim as NFL fans without actually meaning it. A safer boxing is a duller boxing. We\u0027re here to see somebody get their eyes rolled back in their head. When we all talk this morning about how \u0022boring\u0022 the fight was, how much of a waste it was, how boxing always disappoints, how The Fight Of The Century was a dud... that\u0027s what we\u0027re talking about. We\u0027re talking about how no one was hurt, dammit. We\u0027re talking about a lack of action, where action means someone\u0027s cranial fluid leaking out their ears. This could have been 12 rounds of Mayweather bouncing around the ring as Pacquiao flailed around him, but if it had ended with a flurry of Manny punches that knocked Mayweather\u0027s nose into the back of his skull, we would have cheered and screamed and pounded our chests. We wanted blood. We didn\u0027t get it. So we are disappointed.\u000A\u000AIn a way, it\u0027s sort of amazing how Mayweather has been involved in so many huge Pay Per Views: His style is directly opposed to stepping up for the Big Fight. But for all his out-of-ring brutality, his skill is tamping down violence. His goal has always been to make sure the next Pay Per View happens. Before the fight, Mayweather spoke to always-showing-up-at-these-sort-of-things Jim Grey about not having the passion for boxing he once did, that he was just going through the motions because it\u0027s all business in there. In every other sport, athletes are taught to tamp down their love of money when speaking publicly; you\u0027re supposed to be doing this for championships, for your teammates, \u0022for the fans.\u0022 Mayweather does none of this. He is completely upfront about it: \u0022This is about breaking PPV records and getting paid.\u0022 That\u0027s not the most inspiring prefight pep talk if you want cerebral cortes scrambled, but Mayweather just isn\u0027t that sort of bor. He\u0027s too cunning and skilled for that: He\u0027ll run out the clock on you, go home and get paid. Pacquiao had a few moments, particularly in a fourth-round that you hoped would be some a sort of pivot point, but in retrospect those moments may have been Mayweather just making sure you were still watching. Mayweather controlled everything, like he always does. It\u0027s now obvious that Mayweather knew he could win this fight from the beginning and was just holding off on agreeing to it until he could maximize its hype and corral it into the largest PPV of all time. (Which it will surely be.) Wonderful for him: It secures his status as an outstanding businessman. For the rest of us: Yeah, that\u0027s all the world needs, another goddamned businessman.\u000A\u000ABut then again: This is what we had coming all along. We ignore a decade of cruelty toward women from Mayweather, the overall repulsiveness of the human beings who surround the world of boxing, the shocking price tag, the sport\u0027s inherent disorganization and grift. All of it, we ignore because we hope that in the end, we get to see someone\u0027s sentience smashed into gristle for our amusement. We gather and thirst for carnage, and then we grouse this morning that we didn\u0027t get our money\u0027s worth. You paid $100 last night expecting to see a pile of bloody mush in the middle of the ring, and now stomp your feet that you didn\u0027t get it. It didn\u0027t happen, because Mayweather is brilliant at his sport, and because he sees us for the animals we are. We can say we won\u0027t do it again. But we will. Because maybe next time someone will land a killer shot, and we will spill our drinks and howl. Last night we were played for suckers. But it\u0027s our own faults. We deserve every bit of it. We probably deserve worse.\u000A\u000AWill Leitch is a senior writer at Sports On Earth, culture writer for Bloomberg Politics, contributing editor at New York Magazine and the founder of Deadspin.

honest: The appeal of boxing, to the average casual fan, is to watch two people beat the shit out of each other. We can try to claim all we want that it&#x2019;s the personalities, it&#x2019;s the spectacle, it&#x2019;s the <em>sweet science </em>of the thing. We are lying. We tune in to see a guy get punched in the goddamned face.</p><p data-reactid=".bhj54weebk.1.1.0.0.4.5">Suffice it to say, this is not why bors find boxing appealing. Oh, they adore inflicting pain on other men; who wouldn&#x2019;t? But to them, all told, the-repeated-blows-to-the-head deal&#x2014; the one that makes us rise out of our seats and begin to snarl and bray&#x2014; is one they&#x2019;d rather just avoid. The great bors, the truly legendary ones, become so because of their ability to dodge violence as much as their ability to mete it out.</p><p data-reactid=".bhj54weebk.1.1.0.0.4.6">Floyd Mayweather is the perfect example of this. He is one of the greatest bors of all time primarily because his fights are so endlessly frustrating to watch. Mayweather&#x2019;s strength as a bor is his ability to defend and to control the pace of a fight: No matter what his opponent <em>wants </em>to do, Mayweather is able to keep him from it. When Mayweather, so tactically brilliant, figures out the way to make certain you can&#x2019;t cause him any real damage, he just implements that strategy over and over and over until he wins. He doesn&#x2019;t care if he knocks you out; as a genetically modified offspring of Mayweather and Crash Davis might put it, &quot;Knockouts are Fascist.&quot; Mayweather&#x2019;s goal is protect his undefeated record and take home as much as cash as possible. You don&#x2019;t do that by looking for the big hit. You do that by monotonously pressing your advantage until the fight is over.</p><p data-reactid=".bhj54weebk.1.1.0.0.4.7">It&#x2019;s masterful, and smart: It&#x2019;s also an excellent way to avoid being punched in the face, which is wonderful for Floyd Mayweather. (Floyd Mayweather is someone you desperately want to see punched... but just can&#x2019;t.) But as you well know after watching the much-hyped, destined-to-be-Al-Capone&#x2019;s-vault-ed Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fight last night: It is boring as all hell to watch. I&#x2019;m sure boxing diehards loved it: They see the technique and the schematics behind Mayweather&#x2019;s domination of Pacquaio. And I get it: When I watch Mayweather fight, I feel like I learn so much more about boxing, about movement and reach and feints and counterpunching and everything else that goes into this sport. But I don&#x2019;t care about those things. I could care less about how the sausage is made; I just want to see the sausage get pounded. That&#x2019;s what I, and all of you, came here for.</p><p data-reactid=".bhj54weebk.1.1.0.0.4.8">The thing about this is that this is awful. We&#x2019;re running NFL commissioner Roger Goodell through the ringer every time we see him because of his league&#x2019;s seeming disinterest in his player&#x2019;s long-term health, but deep down, we&#x2019;re lying, to him, and ourselves. If we truly cared about those players&#x2019; brains, we&#x2019;d stop watching them bash them into one another for our entertainment. But boxing is worse: Head injuries are a byproduct in the NFL, but in boxing, <em>they are the product. </em>You can&#x2019;t hide in boxing, claiming you just enjoy a <em>safer </em>sport, something I suspect people claim as NFL fans without actually meaning it. A safer boxing is a duller boxing. We&#x2019;re here to see somebody get their eyes rolled back in their head. When we all talk this morning about how &quot;boring&quot; the fight was, how much of a waste it was, how boxing always disappoints, how The Fight Of The Century was a dud... that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re talking about. We&#x2019;re talking about how no one was hurt, dammit. We&#x2019;re talking about a lack of<em> action</em>, where action means someone&#x2019;s cranial fluid leaking out their ears. This could have been 12 rounds of Mayweather bouncing around the ring as Pacquiao flailed around him, but if it had ended with a flurry of Manny punches that knocked Mayweather&#x2019;s nose into the back of his skull, we would have cheered and screamed and pounded our chests. We wanted blood. We didn&#x2019;t get it. So we are disappointed.</p><p data-reactid=".bhj54weebk.1.1.0.0.4.9">In a way, it&#x2019;s sort of amazing how Mayweather has been involved in so many huge Pay Per Views: His style is directly opposed to stepping up for the Big Fight. But for all his <a href="http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2015/04/floyd-mayweather-serial-women-beater.html">out-of-ring brutality</a>, his skill is tamping down violence. His goal has always been to make sure the next Pay Per View happens. Before the fight, Mayweather spoke to always-showing-up-at-these-sort-of-things Jim Grey about not having the passion for boxing he once did, that he was just going through the motions because it&#x2019;s all business in there. In every other sport, athletes are taught to tamp down their love of money when speaking publicly; you&#x2019;re supposed to be doing this for championships, for your teammates, &quot;for the fans.&quot; Mayweather does none of this. He is completely upfront about it: &quot;This is about breaking PPV records and getting paid.&quot; That&#x2019;s not the most inspiring prefight pep talk if you want cerebral cortes scrambled, but Mayweather just isn&#x2019;t that sort of bor. He&#x2019;s too cunning and skilled for that: He&#x2019;ll run out the clock on you, go home and get paid. Pacquiao had a few moments, particularly in a fourth-round that you hoped would be some a sort of pivot point, but in retrospect those moments may have been Mayweather just making sure you were still watching. Mayweather controlled everything, like he always does. It&#x2019;s now obvious that Mayweather knew he could win this fight from the beginning and was just holding off on agreeing to it until he could maximize its hype and corral it into the largest PPV of all time. (Which it will surely be.) Wonderful for him: It secures his status as an outstanding businessman. For the rest of us: Yeah, that&#x2019;s all the world needs, another goddamned businessman.</p><p data-reactid=".bhj54weebk.1.1.0.0.4.a">But then again: This is what we had coming all along. We ignore a decade of cruelty toward women from Mayweather, the overall repulsiveness of the human beings who surround the world of boxing, the shocking price tag, the sport&#x2019;s inherent disorganization and grift. All of it, we ignore because we hope that in the end, we get to see someone&#x2019;s sentience smashed into gristle for our amusement. We gather and thirst for carnage, and then we grouse this morning that we didn&#x2019;t get our money&#x2019;s worth. You paid $100 last night expecting to see a pile of bloody mush in the middle of the ring, and now stomp your feet that you didn&#x2019;t get it. It didn&#x2019;t happen, because Mayweather is brilliant at his sport, and because he sees us for the animals we are. We can say we won&#x2019;t do it again. But we will. Because maybe next time someone <em>will </em>land a killer shot, and we will spill our drinks and howl. Last night we were played for suckers. But it&#x2019;s our own faults. We deserve every bit of it. We probably deserve worse.</p><p data-reactid=".bhj54weebk.1.1.0.0.4.b"><a href="http://www.gq.com/contributors/will-leitch"><em>Will Leitch</em></a><em> is a senior writer at Sports On Earth, culture writer for Bloomberg Politics, contributing editor at New York Magazine and the founder of Deadspin.
