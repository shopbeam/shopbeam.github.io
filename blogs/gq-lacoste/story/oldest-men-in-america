  	    "articleBody": "\u000A\u000ATo reach the land of the supercentenarians, you have to discard your device for a black candlestick phone. You need to trade your Prius for a horse and buggy that leads you down a rutted, magnolia-lined route into the deep past. You must trundle past the presidents, your Bush-Clinton-Bush and Nixon-Kennedy, your Truman-FDR-Hoover, back to the aughts of McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt, until through the foggy mists of timepast computers, televisions, and stand-up radios, past pop-up toasters, Band-Aids, and the Wright brothersyou alight upon the supercentenarian himself, observing him at first not as a specimen of a superhuman race but as the babe he once was, 37 trillion teeming cells, drawing his first toothless breath of super-oxygenated air.\u000A\u000AGahhhh.\u000A\u000ANothing now in his present cooing circumstance would suggest that he possesses one mighty statistical superpower: Out of 15,000 people, only he lives to be 100 years oldand then beyond. Supercentenarian is the term used by longevity experts to signify a near numerical impossibility: those who\u0027ve outpaced 99.9999 percent of the population and landed in the 110+ Club. Today that club includes anywhere from about 100 to 500 people in the world (the wide range due to issues of verification; new candidates can come out of the woodwork at any time)with perhaps only 15 percent of those being male. By living so long, the supercentenarian earns the prefixal super and becomes a person suddenly freighted with power and meaning. He\u0027s Gandalf, Yoda, the Ancient Mariner, perhaps with some otherworldly insight. He\u0027s lived so long that, in fact, he\u0027s living the afterlife to his own initial life.\u000A\u000AWe\u0027re told the life expectancy of an American man has jumped thirty years in over a century, from 46 years old in 1900 to 76 years old now, while more and more of us are living to 90, even 100. But the truth is, we have no real sense of what this means. What happens out there in the outer reaches of Age, at the Pluto extreme of human longevity? How does it workor does it work at all? And how do you get there in the first place? What life habits are required? What secrets conferred? And if you make it that far, if your human body can sustain you for over a century, then, after a certain point, might you just go on living forever?\u000A\u000AI had these questions and more, and so set out looking for old dudes. As if they might all be at Club Super-C, playing pinochle, shadowboxing in black dress socks.\u000A\u000ABut noof course, it wasn\u0027t like that. It wasn\u0027t that easy. Part of what happens when you find yourself flickering near death is that you begin to flicker in real life, tooand then sometimes, no matter what\u0027s scheduled on the calendar, you just disappear.\u000A\u000AALEXANDER IMICH\u000A\u000AAnd flickering he was. I\u0027d read about Alexander Imich, a Polish-born \u0022psychic researcher,\u0022 in The New York Times not long after he\u0027d turned 111 and had been declared the oldest man on earth. There was a picture of a handsome gent swaddled in blankets, propped up in a chair. In the foreground was a birthday cake with three \u00221\u0022 candles on it, and Imich, who was stick-thin and wore a gray beard, seemed fast asleep. The article detailed how he\u0027d grown up in southern Poland, married and remarried,\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI called him. His caretaker, Angela, answered. I told her I was interested in visiting, and since he was having a bit of a celebrity moment, she said she knew he\u0027d be delighted. The attention had re-energized him recently. But he was napping at the moment. Could I call back? And so I didto find him napping again. When I called to say I was going to be in New York in a week\u0027s time and thought I\u0027d just stop by, she said that sounded like the best idea and she\u0027d tell Alexander, who was napping at the moment.\u000A\u000ATwenty-four hours later, he was dead, of \u0022natural causes,\u0022 reportedly speaking Polish and Russian to invisible spirits that had amassed in his hospital room in the waning hours of his life. In an interview just prior, though, he\u0027d chalked up his longevity, in part, to the fact that he and his wife, an artist (who\u0027d died in 1986, nearly thirty years prior), hadn\u0027t had kids. \u0022The compensation for dying,\u0022 he told a friend, \u0022is that I will learn all the things I was not able to learn here on earth.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAfter he passed, I talked to a man named Robert Young, the director of the supercentenarians department at the Gerontology Research Group, an organization that tracks and attempts to verify supercentenarians. It is Young\u0027s responsibility to help dig through documental evidence, and he told me that once someone hits 110, you have to move fast. The average reign of a world\u0027s oldest man was likely to be less than nine months.\u000A\u000AYoung gave me the names of a few who\u0027d popped up on his radar. There were two in Illinois: a Wash Wesley (111) in Maywood and a Conrad Johnson (110) in Rockford. And there were two more in California: a William Del Monte (who, at 109, was on the cusp of \u0022super\u0022 status) in San Francisco and an Andrew Hatch (whose age might have been as high as 116) in Oakland. When I asked Young why he did this workwhy we might be fascinated by epically old menhe said it was much simpler than mysticism.\u000A\u000A\u0022This is about surviving the twentieth century,\u0022 he said. \u0022These men are, in every sense, the soul of a bygone America. But they keep living.\u0022\u000A\u000AWASH WESLEY\u000A\u000AI found the twentieth century, then, not far from O\u0027Hare airport, on a city block of modest homes, in a neighborhood that had seen better days. I flew in on the earliest flight possible, repeating in my mind: Please don\u0027t die. Please don\u0027t die. Ten miles from downtown Chicago, the village of Maywood had originally been settled for its prairie charm, but after being subsumed by the city, and by drugs and guns, it was trying to shake off its gangbang rep. If it was dangerous here, Wash Wesley only cared in the mildest sense. He\u0027d been in his little white house since 1960, a time when the \u0022neighborhood was a neighborhood,\u0022 as he had it, and he wasn\u0027t about to move.\u000A\u000AWhen I was shown in by his grandniece, Millie, there he sat on his beige couch, straight up and alert, a man born under Teddy Roosevelt perched near a photograph of Barack Obama. His close-cropped hair was sprinkled with gray. And his face was nearly smooth. It was strange. He could have been thirty years youngereven fiftyuntil you saw those hands, and then it was just awe. They were like some old parchment, or the glory of elephant feet (and his feet were like elephant feet, toobecause he was sockless, at first), all draped in those fine crosshatched wrinkles-on-wrinkles. Beautiful. His eyes were black marble pupils ringed in blue. His nose was its own fascination, a little melted and made lopsided by time. He\u0027d been born on January 21, 1903, or so he and Millie reasonedthough census records indicate his age in the 110-to-111 range. Born in Ferriday, Louisiana, a black man in the Deep South, during Jim Crow.\u000A\u000AWhatever reserve he first showed evaporated with Millie\u0027s affability. And his gladness at having a visitor: \u0022I\u0027m just an old man and I\u0027ve tried not to be too bad!\u0022 His sleep was all crazy, that was the first thing he wanted to talk about, and he was a little irritable about it. Sleep was one of those automatic things he\u0027d always counted on. And then, you get to this pointoh, about 110 years into your life, and poof! You\u0027re up at all hours and night is day and day is day. \u0022And where\u0027s you supposed to get your sleep?\u0022 he asked rhetorically, his voice a rumbling baritone.\u000A\u000AHe came to the dining-room table, moving slowly but smoothly, no rickety tottering. Millie prompted him, speaking loudly, so he could hear\u0022TELL HIM A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR STORY, UNCLE HICKS!\u0022though there was some question about his hearing in the first place. \u0022I think he only pretends not to hear,\u0022 Millie said, and burst out with that laugh. \u0022It\u0027s convenient. Isn\u0027t that right, Uncle Hicks?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Thass right,\u0022 said Wash, the corners of his mouth lifting. \u0022Ain\u0027t that right. Now you\u0027re onto me.\u0022 He knew who John Kennedy was (\u0022a good prez!\u0022) but didn\u0027t remember an Adolf Hitler. He remembered Vietnam, and Nixon. (\u0022He did everything but the right thing!\u0022) And Martin Luther King, of course, yes. \u0022He stood for righteousness.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022And when they killed him, there were riots right here in the neighborhoods,\u0022 he said. But that was about it in the history department. He had no unified theory, no mine-eyes-have-seen yarns. He\u0027d traveled some, but spent much of the past thirty years on the couch.\u000A\u000AHis own story, then: It, too, was more like a color-by-numbers with big blanks of forgotten white space and fits and starts of remembering. But there was no one left to remember but him. His first wife was dead, and his second; he didn\u0027t have biological children, either. He\u0027d grown up the youngest in his family, with five siblings. He remembered his first job, at 6 or 7, as a water boy in the fields, hydrating the workers who were picking cotton and corn, peanuts and potatoes. He got paid a pittance, whatever it was. But that was his schooling.\u000A\u000AAnd back then, too, in his childhood, he remembered taking a mighty whuppin\u0027 one day when a neighbor boy drowned in the river. He had nothing to do with it but accepted the brunt of it, the collective shock and grief, from a belt in his mama\u0027s hand. As if he should have been more vigilant for drowning boys, and not swimming and having fun like everyone else. At the end of telling the story, he made a low humming sound, like a low snore, that morphed into a little song. He was just singing to himself, though it wasn\u0027t clear if he was singing just to sing or to make himself feel better about all those years ago and that drowned boy. Then he stopped and turned to Millie.\u000A\u000A\u0022I got two chickens in the refrigerator, Millie. Now, can you tell me something: Why would I have two chickens in that refrigerator of mine??\u0022\u000A\u000ACONRAD JOHNSON\u000A\u000AThe next day, I drove a couple of hours west to Rockford. It was late October, and the trees through the window were mostly stripped bare, candelabra harbingers of the long winter ahead.\u000A\u000AOr the short time until spring.\u000A\u000AIt all depended on your disposition.\u000A\u000AI met LaVerne Larson, the caretaker for Conrad Johnson, off the first Rockford exit, in a parking lot near a clock tower. LaVerne possessed that tall-stack midwestern friendliness that comes with a buttery dollop.\u000A\u000AConrad had been born in Sweden, and his birthday had been verified as January 19, 1904. LaVerne had warned me that it might be a tough interview. Conrad had had a stroke right around the time Alexander Imich passed away. His broken English had become even harder to understand, and he lapsed into Swedish quite often.\u000A\u000A\u0022What makes it hardest to understand him, though, is that he just lost his third set of dentures,\u0022 said LaVerne. \u0022He loses them as fast as he gets them. Doesn\u0027t stop him from talking, though.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd talk he did, in his own secret language, too. Gummy and grunty, lip-smacky and careening between English and Swedish. He was dressed neatly, almost aristocratically, for Rockford, I thought, in a camel-colored mock turtleneck and dark slacks. He was compulsively social, with rheumy \u0022blue-hazel eyes,\u0022 as his passport once described them, and wisps of gray hair.\u000A\u000AHe started his story on some hypothetical page 78, in the present tense.\u000A\u000AShe live on da Anderson farm, he said. Or that\u0027s what I thought he said. Who knew?\u000A\u000A\u0022Who is she?\u0022 I wondered, leaning closer, addressing myself to everyone in the room, including the two young female attendants, who\u0027d spent the morning with Conrad.\u000A\u000AAnd my brudder, he seemed to say.\u000A\u000A\u0022She lived with your brother, on the farm?\u0022\u000A\u000AShe wa da firf one.\u000A\u000A\u0022The first wife?\u0022\u000A\u000ADa firf I loved.\u000A\u000A\u0022That you loved.\u0022 (To LaVerne: \u0022Wait, he loved his brother\u0027s wife?\u0022)\u000A\u000AShe lived on da farmnext to ours! He sighed. Da firf I loved!\u000A\u000A\u0022I get it.\u0022 (Less than a minute in, I was already exhausted.)\u000A\u000AMy brudder got da farm, he said. Then there was a long silence, and he seemed to drift away. And returned again. I came to America. If Iya stayed, we\u0027d\u0027ve married. Da firf I loved. (Long silence again: looking up at ceiling again, seemingly lost.) Whass that?\u000A\u000AEveryonethe two young attendants, LaVerne, myselflooked up suddenly, expecting spiders or dripping water or something gooey and extraterrestrial.\u000A\u000AHaving ascertained the nothingness that it was, LaVerne said, \u0022Oh, Conrad, it\u0027s nothing,\u0022 friendly as could be. He\u0027d met Conrad as a boy, when Conrad had been a 40-year-old man. LaVerne remembered all of themthe immigrantsat the local Swedish social club, singing, you know, \u0022O Vermeland, Thou Lovely\u0022 or \u0022All in the Dim Forest.\u0022 He told me that Conrad had become one of the richest men in town, as his goal had always been not to die a poor man. When he\u0027d first come from Sweden, he\u0027d gone to Chicago, where he tried and failed to make his way as a baker, a cake-and-pastry man. Then he\u0027d moved to Rockford, where he started building cabinets. When the city planned to tear down a number of homes that bore his handiwork, he bought them and moved them to another plot of land. He began to rent them outand these became the humble beginnings of his Rockford real-estate-and-construction empire.\u000A\u000A\u0022I think you\u0027re seeing things again, Conrad.\u0022\u000A\u000ASee nuthin\u0027. Owe nuthin\u0027.\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s right,\u0022 said LaVerne.\u000A\u000ACan buy wha I want.\u000A\u000A\u0022Anything you want,\u0022 said LaVerne.\u000A\u000AHah no money. Have a lot now. Deep pocket!\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s right, Conrad.\u0022 LaVerne turned to me again. \u0022He\u0027s always been rich and generous. Church needs new windows, he writes a big check. He gives those gifts all over town.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut she wha da firf and da prettiest, said Conrad. And den I haf to leave.\u000A\u000A\u0022What about your brother, Conrad?\u0022 asked LaVerne. \u0022What do you remember of him?\u0022\u000A\u000AIm? he said, eyebrows shooting up at the memory. He paused as if caught by a sentiment. Im was a lazy bastard! He gah the farm, I gah to leave. Nevah gah to marry da firf I love!\u000A\u000AHe didn\u0027t say it as if he was hurt, exactly, only as if reporting facts, facts approximately one hundred years old.\u000A\u000ABut right there was the whole story: the boy on his family farm, the neighbor girl he loved and lost because he had no money in his pockets, the journey to America, where he understood nothing, failed at the flour trade, and then the everyday reclamation of his own selfhood until he was a rich man looking for the green light across the bay, the one that was no longer there.\u000A\u000AIn the land of very old men, time is a whittler, shaping memory until it fits neatly on the shelf.\u000A\u000APffffff, said Conrad, turning to the two young attendants, twinkling. You married??\u000A\u000AWASH\u000A\u000AThe problem with verifying Wash\u0027s actual age had everything to do with racial segregation and neglectful record-keeping that once left many African-Americans without birth certificates. It didn\u0027t seem to matter much to Wash, though. He\u0027d lived it, all the joy and heartache and mystery. He\u0027d had two wives, Olivia and Ozzie. He may have adopted a kid along the way. There were two chickens in his refrigerator. What was a piece of paper going to tell him about his own existence that he didn\u0027t already know?\u000A\u000AWhen I asked what he remembered of the South from his youth, he seemed to grow reticent for a moment. But Millie prodded him.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027d watched a friend get lynched, that\u0027s what he remembered. In Yazoo County, Mississippi, about 1920. The pageantry, the hanging.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022What could I do?\u0022 he wondered aloud.\u000A\u000A\u0022Were you afraid?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I stayed afraid. I am afraid.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Do you trust white people?\u0022 I asked, realizing the awkwardness of the question, from a white person. Wash went to prayer group every Wednesday, lived by the Bible and its doctrine of forgiveness as best he could. But seeing what he\u0027d seenand what he seemed to be seeing again in his head from ninety-plus years agohe had to think about that question for a few seconds.\u000A\u000A\u0022No,\u0022 he said at last, without malice. \u0022I just can\u0027t trust \u0027em after that.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a notion we have about living into happy old ageor perhaps a fear of what lies at the end of itthat shapes our desire to go on and on, ever young, with robust spirit. And perhaps this fear sparks our deeper denial. Our aspiration, then, is the reversal of time; preservation becomes the fallback. The older we get, the more we desire to reclaim our body at 25; we\u0027ll take our face at 35, the elasticity of our mind at its most powerful, to return ourselves somehow to our most vital moment of rigor and protean creation. But eternal youth, or the appearance of it, runs counter not only to the biological reality of life but also to the possible glories of really letting ourselves grow old in that wrinkled, doddering, forgetful way that we\u0027ve somehow come to believe is an indignity.\u000A\u000AWhat exactly happens when we get old is the subject of a field as inexact as the study of ocean trenches, but we do know a few things. Those 37 trillion cells of oursthey regenerate regularly. That is, as we regenerate, we\u0027re the same but different, and with each new sorting, each new tumbler revolution, our body finds itself increasingly flawed, or less efficient, visited by new mutations, ailments, and mysteries.\u000A\u000AMeanwhile, changes in the brain lead to full fecundity in our early twenties, and from there, neurons begin to shrink and atrophy, interconnectedness diminishes, blood flow drops off. We begin to forget names, lose some of our verbal fluency. We freak out. But the truth is, these facts don\u0027t necessarily suggest that we\u0027re in a state of accelerated mental decline. According to some researchers, we\u0027re merely in a state of dynamic change. The brain isn\u0027t an overloaded hard drive, busting with too much to remember, nor is the brain an engine running out of gas. We continue to acquire and process information, store it, and retrieve it. Until otherwise afflicted, we live in a rich world of ideas and memories, even if sometimes we reach for our former verbal fluency and fail. A brain recently autopsied from a 115-year-old looked like that of a 60-year-old.\u000A\u000ABut here\u0027s the thing: The oldthe really, really, really olddon\u0027t care so much about this stuff. It\u0027s the young and the middle-aged who do. There\u0027s a dividing line: At 38, if you live to average American age, you\u0027re halfway to the end, after several regenerations of 37 trillion cells with all their mutations, and maybe the one that will undo you.\u000A\u000APut like that, knowing all we have left to do and all the countries we want to see, all the books on the shelf and bottles of wine left to linger over, who wouldn\u0027t want to add a few extra years? And a few more beyond that, as well.\u000A\u000ASo we diet and exercise, drink a quart of kale juice a day, cleanse and undergo our colonic intrusions. Yes, there\u0027s a biological reality, a ticking clock. You don\u0027t control that, unfortunately. But there\u0027s also a way of aging that might allow you to age longer. The atmospheric and attitudinal, what you surround yourself with, or how you accept what comes your way. Somewhere in all of this, I realized that if the internal clock is perhaps genetically preprogrammed, then this other half of it is worth searching for. How did these old guys relate to their oldness and to the physical reality of getting oldand was there anything in my atmospheric and attitudinal self that might suggest that I could, too?\u000A\u000AWILLIAM DEL MONTE\u000A\u000ALesson one: Time is precious. Especially when you\u0027ve had more of it than anyone else.\u000A\u000AAhead of my planned trip to California to visit the other olds, I left messages and sent e-mails to the director of the nursing home in which one William Del Monte resides. News clips had it that he was the only living male survivor of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, having been three months old at the time and spirited by his mother through the streets of the fiery city wrapped in a tablecloth. Of Italian heritage, he, too, had been married without children. (Was that the secret, no children?) While initially the nursing home expressed optimism about our meetingafter all, Del Monte could be found on a YouTube video sharing some rambling reminiscences about his life, about swimming naked in the Bay as a kid or taking his tip money as a hatcheck boy and investing it in the stock market, claiming that he lost about a million dollars in the 1929 stock market crashI couldn\u0027t persuade him to meet.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m 109,\u0022 said Del Monte through his proxy. \u0022I don\u0027t have time for this stuff.\u000A\u000AANDREW HATCH\u000A\u000AThankfully, there was another supercentenarian just over the bridge in Oakland, Andrew Hatch, whom I soon found in a modest house just off 580, where the reception was so warm I felt a little like a blood relation. If his birth date was to be believed, Andrew might have been the oldest man ever recorded. (The oldest fully verified living American man is a 109-year-old in Nebraska.) Andrew\u0027s census records, as reliable as Wash\u0027s, indicated a birth year of 1905. But he wasn\u0027t looking for the title, far from it. He was just certain he\u0027d been born on October 7, 1898. And he had a special memory for facts.\u000A\u000AHe, too, had been born in the Deep South, in Louisiana. He, too, was African-American and didn\u0027t possess a birth certificate. He, too, didn\u0027t wear dentures, so you had to lean in to understand his euphoric chitter-chatter, which in his case sometimes jumped over into Spanish, a result of five years in Mexico. Most important, he was an anomaly in this rare stratum of super-old men. He, unlike the others, was not childless; he had a daughter, named Delane, who\u0027d arrived in his life quite late, when he was about 60. She took care of him at her house now, after he\u0027d been found in his old apartment last spring, unconscious. Prior to that, he was famous for riding his sit-down scooter everywhere. There were days when he disappeared for up to eight hours on that scooter. If he wanted to see downtown, he might scooter downtown.\u000A\u000ANow, however, he was set up in a bed, in the living room, the sound of 580 like a river rushing beyond the window. When Delane was born, Andrew was at a moment when he needed saving. He was deep into the bottle, not taking care of himself. He\u0027d been a cabdriver in Oakland and knew that city as well, or better, than anyone. He knew where the politicians went late at night, and he knew who went home with whom. He was such an extrovert, and such an affable one. But he was so footloose as to have maybe lost the thread of meaning in his life. And Delane changed that. Instantly. He made a promise to himself that although he wasn\u0027t going to marry Delane\u0027s mother (they remained close friends), he was going to be a real father to her. So he gave up booze and never drank again, as far as anyone could tell. Now father and daughter kept themselves tightly threaded together.\u000A\u000Alesson two: If you have a reason for livingan ongoing call-and-responseyou might just keep on living.\u000A\u000A\u0022How you doing, Daddy?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Real good.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You want some gum, Daddy?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I reckon so.\u0022 (Andrew chewed so much Juicy Fruit his family claimed jokingly that they were going broke.)\u000A\u000A\u0022You comfortable, Daddy?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000ADelane\u0027s sons, in their twenties and thirties, came and went, sitting with him, making time. One grandson had tight dreads that fell to the middle of his back, accompanied by an array of tattoos. He was a rapper, and he told me his grandfather, at his speculative age of 116, had recently been in a video he\u0027d shot. Andrew wore his trademark fedora, carried his trademark cane, and when it came time, he danced. Or moved like he was dancing. But still.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027d been in a rap video, and no one seemed more pleased about it than him.\u000A\u000AWILLIAM\u000A\u000AI confess, I had less-than-generous thoughts after the brush-off by William Del Monte. Really? He had no time? So what was taking up so much of his time? Sudoku? The Charleston? It was precisely because, at 109, William Del Monte didn\u0027t have \u0022time for this stuff that I wanted him to make \u0022time for this stuff. So I could ask him about time, and his management of it, his rejection of people like me, which gave him more time to pursue his own bliss. I\u0027ll tell you: I came to believe it had everything to do with the \u0022U-bend of happiness.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe U-bend of happiness was described in a 2010 study of nearly 350,000 people, ranging from 18 to 80-plus, and it told me something I both wanted and didn\u0027t want to know. When asked by researchers to gauge their level of happiness based on, among other things, their levels of worry, those in the 20-to-30-year-old demographic felt pretty good. But from there, worry picked up fiercely, and happiness declined precipitously through middle age, hitting a nadir around the 50-year-old range, my range in fact. (And the moment when many parents are often dealing with teenage kids.)\u000A\u000ABut then an astonishing thing occurred: As people grew older, happiness started climbing againand then kept climbing and climbing the longer one livedpast those original levels of euphoric youth to previously uncharted heights. Summing up the phenomenon, The Economist wrote, \u0022Although as people move towards old age they lose things they treasurevitality, mental sharpness and looksthey also gain what people spend their lives pursuing: happiness.\u0022 Perhaps, the article posited, it was because old people maintain, according to Stanford professor Laura Carstensen, \u0022the uniquely human ability to recognize our own mortality and monitor our own time horizons.\u0022 The article continued:\u000A\u000ABecause the old know they are closer to death, [Carstensen] argues, they grow better at living for the present. They come to focus on things that matter nowsuch as feelingsand less on long-term goals. \u0022When young people look at older people, they think how terrifying it must be to be nearing the end of your life. But older people know what matters most.\u0022 For instance, she says, \u0022young people will go to cocktail parties because they might meet somebody who will be useful to them in the future, even though nobody I know actually likes going to cocktail parties.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo was that it in a nutshell? William Del Monte didn\u0027t need me as much as I needed him. He had his own scotch, his own party. He had the ice, and probably the Cole Porter records, too. On the U-bend of happiness, he was up, and I was down.\u000A\u000AUnderstanding time as he did, of course, William Del Monte clearly had none of it for this kind of stuff. And rightly so. He was living in a place called \u0022a nursing home,\u0022 hermetically sealed and ostensibly happyand one would surmise he\u0027d settled his accounts maybe twenty years ago.\u000A\u000Alesson three, then: If the rest is gravy, it\u0027s up to you to make sure it is indeed gravy. That is, if you\u0027re living the afterlife to your own original life, you have to work from a simple principle: Knowing that this second life of yours is much more temporal and fragile than your first, do you really want to waste one second sharing your secrets with some schlub from GQ?\u000A\u000ACONRAD\u000A\u000ALesson four: Memory is sustaining, even when you doan remember nuttin\u0027.\u000A\u000ABack in Conrad Johnson\u0027s room in Rockford, LaVerne tried to direct Conrad through a rapid-fire round of what I\u0027ll call \u0022I Remember.\u0022 Before his stroke, Conrad walked for exercise each day, kept away from alcohol, drilled in on his finances. His mind was full and focused, clicking and whirring. After the stroke, he was more in and out, had little interest in his money, jumped from random memory to random memory, as if bog-hopping through space and time. He wore a yellow bracelet that identified him as a \u0022Fall Risk.\u0022 He was belted to his Brody chair.\u000A\u000A\u0022Do you remember visiting the Holy Land?\u0022 LaVerne asked, hoping to jog loose a story.\u000A\u000ADoan remember.\u000A\u000A\u0022With Walborg, your first wife?\u0022\u000A\u000ADoan remember her.\u000A\u000AAfter she died, he\u0027d remarried, at the age of 86. \u0022Do you remember Alice, your second wife?\u0022\u000A\u000AAlice?\u000A\u000A\u0022World War II, the Korean War?\u0022\u000A\u000ADoan remember those.\u000A\u000A\u0022Conrad, what were the best times?\u0022\u000A\u000ADoan remember. I live one day a time. Try to be happy. He sat still for a moment. LaVerne could see he wasn\u0027t getting very far, and a heavy silence fell upon the room. He couldn\u0027t even remember his wives. Then Conrad started talking again on his own, this time with absolute clarity of pronunciation, as if he\u0027d come upon a lost suitcase full of fond memories and opened it before our eyes.\u000A\u000AWe had woods and pumped water. Father\u0027s big saw. Remember that.\u000A\u000ATook baths in the barn. Mother was fussy: Don\u0027t wear shoes in house. I remember that!\u000A\u000AI remember fatherand that ditch. Remember it well!\u000A\u000AGraves That\u0027s all I remember.\u000A\u000AChopping wood.\u000A\u000AThe pouring of whiskey.\u000A\u000AJumped over itand what they said. Remember that.\u000A\u000AHe looked at LaVerne thenand meturning the question on us this time.\u000A\u000ADo you remember that? he said, eyes twinkling, laughing out loud, as if we were all in on it now. I\u0027ll be a son of a gun!\u000A\u000AANDREW\u000A\u000AYes, those who lived in the land of supercentenarians had won the genetic lottery, but they\u0027d also been lucky in other ways. Andrew Hatch could remember an offense back in the old times, in the Deep South, called reckless eyeballing. Well, Andrew Hatch wasn\u0027t the sort to forgo proper appreciation for a pretty woman walking by on the street. You could invent laws to keep people from being human, but that didn\u0027t mean people had to obey them.\u000A\u000ASo this was 1920s Irving, Texas, and this is how he remembered it: A white woman walked by. Whether Andrew even looked is debatable, but suddenly there was a mob, and he stood accused of reckless eyeballing. The instant judgment was hanging. He was thrown in a cell while everyone spread the word to gather later for the lynching.\u000A\u000AThing was, Andrew\u0027s hidden talent was this innate ability to look at a lock, take a mental picture, and then fashion a key that would work to open it. He always carried a blank key and a little file, that was something even Delane remembered. In his 110-plus years, he\u0027d picked every kind of lock there was.\u000A\u000AAnd so he picked the one on the cell, and he saw himself out, and he fled to Mexico, where he lived for five years. When he came back to his home country, he decided to try California. Even years later, even now lying in his bed in Delane\u0027s living room next to the running river of 580, he sometimes grew a little paranoid that they were going to come for him, all those white people, that they were going to remind him he\u0027d broken the law, and this time they\u0027d empty his pockets and there\u0027d be no escape.\u000A\u000AWASH\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s the oldest registered driver in Illinois. He\u0027s required to renew his license every year by taking the test. What\u0027s there to study? He\u0027s been driving for about ninety-five years. Every year, he passes with flying colors.\u000A\u000Alesson five: Don\u0027t stop driving.\u000A\u000AAndrew\u000A\u000AAs it turns out, there\u0027s a jellyfish, Turritopsis dohrnii, known as the only creature on earth that exhibits a sort of immortality. When near death, it rejuvenates itself by shifting into something called a polyp state. So it literally reverts from sexual maturity to asexual immaturity, from adulthood to childhood. Under duress, it puts old cells to new use.\u000A\u000AThis is really true: These jellyfish live a very long, as-yet-undocumented amount of time and are being studied for possible human benefits. But does it suggest the most obvious thing, that sex is not everything, or not even as life-giving as we think? Maybe the supercentenarian already knows something about this.\u000A\u000A\u0022I gave up women when I was 86,\u0022 declares Andrew Hatch, propped in his bed. (One interesting similarity among supercentenarians seems to be this ability to give things up, to exhibit self-discipline, perhaps after a lack of it, sometimes after decades of lacking it, be it the instant cessation of cigarettes, booze in excess, women, whatever. Let\u0027s call that lesson six: Learn to give it up.)\u000A\u000ABut why give up women?\u000A\u000A\u0022It wasn\u0027t that I didn\u0027t still love \u0027em,\u0022 he says. \u0022I just had to quit \u0027em.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022He had a very good run,\u0022 says Delane, winking. \u0022Ain\u0027t that right, Daddy?\u0022\u000A\u000AAndrew smiled at that, mischievously. It wasn\u0027t that his physical ability to continue liking them had gone defunct; it was that the intricacies of a sex-based relationship took so much time. And he had his daughter and grandkids, his friends and community. He spent his time scootering here and there, with no care in the world. Why did he need a woman?\u000A\u000AImmortal jellyfish or not, he wasn\u0027t trying to live longer, he was just trying to enjoy the time he had left. A big difference. In fact, it seemed that none of the decisions made by Wash or Conrad or Andrew were for the purpose of one day proclaiming the secrets of their radical longevity. They didn\u0027t eat less by adhering to the Confucian hara hachi bu, or spend years on a Himalayan quest to find their life\u0027s highest purpose. They didn\u0027t suddenly become extroverts, or develop an instant klatch of close friends, or drink Sardinian wine with three times the polyphenols. But what they did do was replace their vices with lesser ones as their lives took their various twists and turns. They kept loving and praying and doing for themselves, always doing for themselves, driving the car, doing the shopping, making the sandwich. The more physically limited they became, the more accepting they were. But that didn\u0027t mean they were giving up.\u000A\u000AWASH\u000A\u000A\u0022Do you remember the best days of your life?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022These are the best days of my life! I can do anything I want to do. I can lay down whenever I want. I can drink Gatorade all day long.\u0022\u000A\u000ACONRAD\u000A\u000AWheeled in his Brody chair to lunch, he kept talking and talking, his young attendants, Natalia and Risa, laughing out loud at everything he said, though half of it was in Swedish. It was the way he said it, with such joyful insistence and glee, with little hisses of laughter. It was the most wonderful kind of asexual flirting to witness, a deeper kind of affection, and perhaps more true, because there was no desire for, or threat of, consummation.\u000A\u000AOne of the attendants took some mashed potato and offered a cloud of it on a fork. He took it all gently in his mouth, like a careful baby watching his mother, gumming it until he could, within the bounds of good manners, call it macerated and swallowed. Then he continued on with his story, as if there were nothing more urgent in all the world.\u000A\u000Alesson seven: If you want to live a long time, then, keep chewing Juicy Fruit. Drink Gatorade whenever you want. Flirt and scooter. Continue on with your story.\u000A\u000ABut of course, accept that the story ends, as well. It has to. We all know that. We really aren\u0027t jellyfish, after all.\u000A\u000AMaybe it comes, as it did for Conrad, on a December morning right before Christmas. Maybe it\u0027s the evening before you\u0027re going to die, and good old LaVerne is there as usual, and maybe he looks murkier through rheumy eyes, with that funny mustache. And maybe you tell all the stories again, or at least the ones about growing up in Sweden, because those seem to be exactly what you remember with a crystalline sort of recall: the farm, the girl that should have been yours. Maybe LaVerne shaves you like he always does. And then you have to feed the cows and pigs, because Daddy says so. And the nurses give a good-night peck on your forehead and you say, Gahhhh! What about on the lips? And burst into laughter at their surprise. Maybe you fall fast asleep and sleep a really wonderful sleep, so pure and deep you don\u0027t want to give it up in the morning, because the movies on the back of your eyelids are so familiar and beautiful.\u000A\u000AMaybe you wake to see the sun, or what the weather is doing, but that sleep, it calls you back with such insistence. So you roll over, take an easy breath, almost like a satisfied sigh.\u000A\u000AAnd without even considering it, it happens to be your last.\u000A\u000AWASH\u000A\u000AA story about really, really old men might rightly end with a funeral, for here\u0027s the thing, finally: A majority of Americans, when asked if they want to live forever, seem clear that they\u0027d like to live in good health until about 90. Only 8 percent of us say we want to live to 120. Whether we can\u0027t imagine a future in which our blood might be injected with disease-fighting nanobots, or can\u0027t imagine one in which our husbands and wives, our children and friends, all predecease us, life beyond a hundred seems a faraway scary place that gets a little closer when you meet the supercentenarians: Wash on his living room couch, even now worrying about two holes in his roof; or Conrad chattering his stories; or Andrew Hatch, surrounded by family, chomping gum. When you outlive all the people in the first half of your life, when the wrinkles have covered your body (or not) and you don\u0027t hear so well (or you secretly do), when you\u0027ve been disappointed by your new limitations and then have given up those disappointments, it\u0027s true you find yourself reborn, in a tight cluster with those from the second half of your life who gather a little more closely around you, to protect you, it seems.\u000A\u000AOne day I go to church with Wash, to his Wednesday prayer group, where he\u0027s greeted with great fanfare by the pastor, who\u0027s 83 himself and calls him \u0022Brother Wesley.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Lord,\u0022 says the pastor to the dozen who\u0027ve gathered, \u0022we know we\u0027re here for only a short time. But I\u0027m ordering my steps now, Lord Jesus. He has granted me four score and three years. I ain\u0027t afraid. Who wants to be young? They don\u0027t know nothingand think they know everything! We shouldn\u0027t be ashamed of our age. Our age is a blessing!\u0022\u000A\u000ATo this, there are a lot of Amens and That\u0027s rights. The pastor continues. \u0022There were those who walked and talked and ate with Jesus. Our privilege is to do the same with Brother Wesley. We don\u0027t need to wonder what 111 looks like! We live with him and talk with him. And I should say, this church is only 110 years old, one year younger than Brother Wesley.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis creates a titter of laughter. Wash betrays no sense that he\u0027s being talked about. Is he impervious? Unhearing? It seems to be the opposite. He\u0027s most pervious; the old man misses nothing. In fact, there\u0027s something steely and luminous inside himcall it willthat seems to bridge each day to the next. And maybe this is lesson eight: If you want to live a long time, you have to really really want to live a long time. And have your own deep-down reasons for living a long time, well after the temporal pursuits of recognition and moneyor even of the fleshare gone. When you\u0027re stripped clean of those, something else fills you, thena new spirit, or hope. The world holds its own infinity that is no bigger than your living room, or this church here. And it\u0027s yours to seize.\u000A\u000AThe pastor directs everyone to their songbooks and \u0022Go Tell It on the Mountain.\u0022 Wash picks up his, perches his reading glasses on the bridge of his nose. Everyone begins to sing in unison, and at first his voice comes softly, almost tremulous and uncertain in that baritone. By the fourth verse, however, he is singing bright and clear, as if he\u0027s found his strength again.\u000A\u000AHe sings for yet another life after this one. And like this, he goes on. And on.\u000A\u000AMichael Paterniti is a GQ correspondent and the author of, most recently, Love and Other Ways of Dying.",

very oldest men in America are in an exclusive cluba club more exclusive than the Ex-Presidents or the Moon Walkers. Theirs is the eleven-decade club. The &quot;40,000 days lived&quot; club. The &quot;I was born at the turn of the century&quot; club! That&#39;s a lot of life. So, then: What do the men who&#39;ve experienced more of it than anyone else know about life, anyway?</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed noscript" data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.0"><noscript></noscript></div><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.1">To reach the land of the supercentenarians, you have to discard your device for a black candlestick phone. You need to trade your Prius for a horse and buggy that leads you down a rutted, magnolia-lined route into the deep past. You must trundle past the presidents, your Bush-Clinton-Bush and Nixon-Kennedy, your Truman-FDR-Hoover, back to the aughts of McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt, until through the foggy mists of timepast computers, televisions, and stand-up radios, past pop-up toasters, Band-Aids, and the Wright brothersyou alight upon the supercentenarian himself, observing him at first not as a specimen of a superhuman race but as the babe he once was, 37 trillion teeming cells, drawing his first toothless breath of super-oxygenated air.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2"><em>Gahhhh</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3">Nothing now in his present cooing circumstance would suggest that he possesses one mighty statistical superpower: Out of 15,000 people, only he lives to be 100 years oldand then beyond. Supercentenarian is the term used by longevity experts to signify a near numerical impossibility: those who&#x2019;ve outpaced 99.9999 percent of the population and landed in the 110+ Club. Today that club includes anywhere from about 100 to 500 people in the world (the wide range due to issues of verification; new candidates can come out of the woodwork at any time)with perhaps only 15 percent of those being male. By living so long, the supercentenarian earns the prefixal <em>super</em> and becomes a person suddenly freighted with power and meaning. He&#x2019;s Gandalf, Yoda, the Ancient Mariner, perhaps with some otherworldly insight. He&#x2019;s lived so long that, in fact, he&#x2019;s living the afterlife to his own initial life.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.5">We&#x2019;re told the life expectancy of an American man has jumped thirty years in over a century, from 46 years old in 1900 to 76 years old now, while more and more of us are living to 90, even 100. But the truth is, we have no real sense of what this <em>means.</em> What happens out there in the outer reaches of Age, at the Pluto extreme of human longevity? How <em>does</em> it workor does <em>it</em> work at all? And how do you get there in the first place? What life habits are required? What secrets conferred? And if you make it that far, if your human body can sustain you for over a century, then, after a certain point, might you just go on living forever?</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.6">I had these questions and more, and so set out looking for old dudes. As if they might all be at Club Super-C, playing pinochle, shadowboxing in black dress socks.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.7">But noof course, it wasn&#x2019;t like that. It wasn&#x2019;t that easy. Part of what happens when you find yourself flickering near death is that you begin to flicker in real life, tooand then sometimes, no matter what&#x2019;s scheduled on the calendar, you just disappear.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>ALEXANDER IMICH</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.9">And flickering he was. I&#x2019;d read about Alexander Imich, a Polish-born &quot;psychic researcher,&quot; in <em>The New York Times</em> not long after he&#x2019;d turned 111 and had been declared the oldest man on earth. There was a picture of a handsome gent swaddled in blankets, propped up in a chair. In the foreground was a birthday cake with three &quot;1&quot; candles on it, and Imich, who was stick-thin and wore a gray beard, seemed fast asleep. The article detailed how he&#x2019;d grown up in southern Poland, married and remarried,</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.a"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5592ff5d6e48e6391a256e92/master/w_806/life-2015-05-old-men-02.jpg" alt="life-2015-05-old-men-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Foldest-men-in-america&amp;t=life-2015-05-old-men-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Foldest-men-in-america&amp;t=life-2015-05-old-men-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Foldest-men-in-america&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5592ff5d6e48e6391a256e92%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-05-old-men-02.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-05-old-men-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Foldest-men-in-america&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5592ff5d6e48e6391a256e92%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-05-old-men-02.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-05-old-men-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.b">I called him. His caretaker, Angela, answered. I told her I was interested in visiting, and since he was having a bit of a celebrity moment, she said she knew he&#x2019;d be delighted. The attention had re-energized him recently. But he was napping at the moment. Could I call back? And so I didto find him napping again. When I called to say I was going to be in New York in a week&#x2019;s time and thought I&#x2019;d just stop by, she said that sounded like the best idea and she&#x2019;d tell Alexander, who was napping at the moment.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.c">Twenty-four hours later, he was dead, of &quot;natural causes,&quot; reportedly speaking Polish and Russian to invisible spirits that had amassed in his hospital room in the waning hours of his life. In an interview just prior, though, he&#x2019;d chalked up his longevity, in part, to the fact that he and his wife, an artist (who&#x2019;d died in 1986, nearly thirty years prior), hadn&#x2019;t had kids. &quot;The compensation for dying,&quot; he told a friend, &quot;is that I will learn all the things I was not able to learn here on earth.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.d"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5592ff5d7cc23bc864242388/master/w_806/life-2015-05-old-men-03.jpg" alt="life-2015-05-old-men-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Foldest-men-in-america&amp;t=life-2015-05-old-men-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Foldest-men-in-america&amp;t=life-2015-05-old-men-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Foldest-men-in-america&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5592ff5d7cc23bc864242388%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-05-old-men-03.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-05-old-men-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Foldest-men-in-america&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5592ff5d7cc23bc864242388%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-05-old-men-03.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-05-old-men-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.e">After he passed, I talked to a man named Robert Young, the director of the supercentenarians department at the Gerontology Research Group, an organization that tracks and attempts to verify supercentenarians. It is Young&#x2019;s responsibility to help dig through documental evidence, and he told me that once someone hits 110, you have to move fast. The average reign of a world&#x2019;s oldest man was likely to be less than nine months.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.f">Young gave me the names of a few who&#x2019;d popped up on his radar. There were two in Illinois: a Wash Wesley (111) in Maywood and a Conrad Johnson (110) in Rockford. And there were two more in California: a William Del Monte (who, at 109, was on the cusp of &quot;super&quot; status) in San Francisco and an Andrew Hatch (whose age might have been as high as 116) in Oakland. When I asked Young why he did this workwhy we might be fascinated by epically old menhe said it was much simpler than mysticism.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.g">&quot;This is about surviving the twentieth century,&quot; he said. &quot;These men are, in every sense, the soul of a bygone America. But they keep living.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>WASH WESLEY</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.i">I found the twentieth century, then, not far from O&#x2019;Hare airport, on a city block of modest homes, in a neighborhood that had seen better days. I flew in on the earliest flight possible, repeating in my mind: <em>Please don&#x2019;t die. Please don&#x2019;t die.</em> Ten miles from downtown Chicago, the village of Maywood had originally been settled for its prairie charm, but after being subsumed by the city, and by drugs and guns, it was trying to shake off its gangbang rep. If it was dangerous here, Wash Wesley only cared in the mildest sense. He&#x2019;d been in his little white house since 1960, a time when the &quot;neighborhood was a neighborhood,&quot; as he had it, and he wasn&#x2019;t about to move.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.j">When I was shown in by his grandniece, Millie, there he sat on his beige couch, straight up and alert, a man born under Teddy Roosevelt perched near a photograph of Barack Obama. His close-cropped hair was sprinkled with gray. And his face was nearly smooth. It was strange. He could have been thirty years youngereven fiftyuntil you saw those hands, and then it was just awe. They were like some old parchment, or the glory of elephant feet (and his feet were like elephant feet, toobecause he was sockless, at first), all draped in those fine crosshatched wrinkles-on-wrinkles. Beautiful. His eyes were black marble pupils ringed in blue. His nose was its own fascination, a little melted and made lopsided by time. He&#x2019;d been born on January 21, 1903, or so he and Millie reasonedthough census records indicate his age in the 110-to-111 range. Born in Ferriday, Louisiana, a black man in the Deep South, during Jim Crow.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.k">Whatever reserve he first showed evaporated with Millie&#x2019;s affability. And his gladness at having a visitor: &quot;I&#x2019;m just an old man and I&#x2019;ve tried not to be <em>too</em> bad!&quot; His sleep was all crazy, that was the first thing he wanted to talk about, and he was a little irritable about it. Sleep was one of those automatic things he&#x2019;d always counted on. And then, you get to this pointoh, about <em>110 years into your life,</em> and <em>poof!</em> You&#x2019;re up at all hours and night is day and day is day. &quot;And where&#x2019;s you supposed to get your <em>sleep?</em>&quot; he asked rhetorically, his voice a rumbling baritone.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.l">He came to the dining-room table, moving slowly but smoothly, no rickety tottering. Millie prompted him, speaking loudly, so he could hear&quot;TELL HIM A LITTLE ABOUT YOUR STORY, UNCLE HICKS!&quot;though there was some question about his hearing in the first place. &quot;I think he only <em>pretends</em> not to hear,&quot; Millie said, and burst out with that laugh. &quot;It&#x2019;s convenient.

But that was about it in the history department. He had no unified theory, no mine-eyes-have-seen yarns. He&#x2019;d traveled some, but spent much of the past thirty years on the couch.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.p">His own story, then: It, too, was more like a color-by-numbers with big blanks of forgotten white space and fits and starts of remembering. But there was no one left to remember but him. His first wife was dead, and his second; he didn&#x2019;t have biological children, either. He&#x2019;d grown up the youngest in his family, with five siblings. He remembered his first job, at 6 or 7, as a water boy in the fields, hydrating the workers who were picking cotton and corn, peanuts and potatoes. He got paid a pittance, whatever it was. But that was his schooling.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.q">And back then, too, in his childhood, he remembered taking a mighty whuppin&#x2019; one day when a neighbor boy drowned in the river. He had nothing to do with it but accepted the brunt of it, the collective shock and grief, from a belt in his mama&#x2019;s hand. As if he should have been more vigilant for drowning boys, and not swimming and having fun like everyone else. At the end of telling the story, he made a low humming sound, like a low snore, that morphed into a little song. He was just singing to himself, though it wasn&#x2019;t clear if he was singing just to sing or to make himself feel better about all those years ago and that drowned boy. Then he stopped and turned to Millie.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.r">&quot;I got two chickens in the refrigerator, Millie.

It was late October, and the trees through the window were mostly stripped bare, candelabra harbingers of the long winter ahead.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.u">Or the short time until spring.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.v">It all depended on your disposition.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.w">I met LaVerne Larson, the caretaker for Conrad Johnson, off the first Rockford exit, in a parking lot near a clock tower. LaVerne possessed that tall-stack midwestern friendliness that comes with a buttery dollop.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.x">Conrad had been born in Sweden, and his birthday had been verified as January 19, 1904. LaVerne had warned me that it might be a tough interview. Conrad had had a stroke right around the time Alexander Imich passed away. His broken English had become even harder to understand, and he lapsed into Swedish quite often.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.y">&quot;What makes it hardest to understand him, though, is that he just lost his third set of dentures,&quot; said LaVerne. &quot;He loses them as fast as he gets them. Doesn&#x2019;t stop him from talking, though.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.z">And talk he did, in his own secret language, too. Gummy and grunty, lip-smacky and careening between English and Swedish. He was dressed neatly, almost aristocratically, for Rockford, I thought, in a camel-colored mock turtleneck and dark slacks. He was compulsively social, with rheumy &quot;blue-hazel eyes,&quot; as his passport once described them, and wisps of gray hair.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.10">He started his story on some hypothetical page 78, in the present tense.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.11"><em>She live on da Anderson farm,</em> he said.

He&#x2019;d met Conrad as a boy, when Conrad had been a 40-year-old man. LaVerne remembered all of themthe immigrantsat the local Swedish social club, singing, you know, &quot;O Vermeland, Thou Lovely&quot; or &quot;All in the Dim Forest.&quot; He told me that Conrad had become one of the richest men in town, as his goal had always been not to die a poor man. When he&#x2019;d first come from Sweden, he&#x2019;d gone to Chicago, where he tried and failed to make his way as a baker, a cake-and-pastry man. Then he&#x2019;d moved to Rockford, where he started building cabinets. When the city planned to tear down a number of homes that bore his handiwork, he bought them and moved them to another plot of land. He began to rent them outand these became the humble beginnings of his Rockford real-estate-and-construction empire.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.1e">&quot;I think you&#x2019;re seeing things again, Conrad.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><em>See nuthin&#x2019;.

It didn&#x2019;t seem to matter much to Wash, though. He&#x2019;d lived it, all the joy and heartache and mystery. He&#x2019;d had two wives, Olivia and Ozzie.

I <em>am</em> afraid.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.20">&quot;Do you trust white people?&quot; I asked, realizing the awkwardness of the question, from a white person. Wash went to prayer group every Wednesday, lived by the Bible and its doctrine of forgiveness as best he could. But seeing what he&#x2019;d seenand what he seemed to be seeing again in his head from ninety-plus years agohe had to think about that question for a few seconds.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.21">&quot;No,&quot; he said at last, without malice. &quot;I just can&#x2019;t trust &#x2019;em after that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.22"><strong>There&#x2019;s a notion we</strong> have about living into happy old ageor perhaps a fear of what lies at the end of itthat shapes our desire to go on and on, ever young, with robust spirit. And perhaps this fear sparks our deeper denial. Our aspiration, then, is the reversal of time; preservation becomes the fallback. The older we get, the more we desire to reclaim our body at 25; we&#x2019;ll take our face at 35, the elasticity of our mind at its most powerful, to return ourselves somehow to our most vital moment of rigor and protean creation. But eternal youth, or the appearance of it, runs counter not only to the biological reality of life but also to the possible glories of really letting ourselves grow old in that wrinkled, doddering, forgetful way that we&#x2019;ve somehow come to believe is an indignity.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.23">What exactly happens when we get old is the subject of a field as inexact as the study of ocean trenches, but we do know a few things. Those 37 trillion cells of oursthey regenerate regularly. That is, as we regenerate, we&#x2019;re the same but different, and with each new sorting, each new tumbler revolution, our body finds itself increasingly flawed, or less efficient, visited by new mutations, ailments, and mysteries.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.24">Meanwhile, changes in the brain lead to full fecundity in our early twenties, and from there, neurons begin to shrink and atrophy, interconnectedness diminishes, blood flow drops off. We begin to forget names, lose some of our verbal fluency. We freak out. But the truth is, these facts don&#x2019;t necessarily suggest that we&#x2019;re in a state of accelerated mental decline. According to some researchers, we&#x2019;re merely in a state of dynamic change. The brain isn&#x2019;t an overloaded hard drive, busting with too much to remember, nor is the brain an engine running out of gas. We continue to acquire and process information, store it, and retrieve it. Until otherwise afflicted, we live in a rich world of ideas and memories, even if sometimes we reach for our former verbal fluency and fail. A brain recently autopsied from a 115-year-old looked like that of a 60-year-old.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.25">But here&#x2019;s the thing: The oldthe really, really, really olddon&#x2019;t care so much about this stuff. It&#x2019;s the young and the middle-aged who do. There&#x2019;s a dividing line: At 38, if you live to average American age, you&#x2019;re halfway to the end, after several regenerations of 37 trillion cells with all their mutations, and maybe the one that will undo you.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.26">Put like that, knowing all we have left to do and all the countries we want to see, all the books on the shelf and bottles of wine left to linger over, who wouldn&#x2019;t want to add a few extra years? And a few more beyond that, as well.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.27">So we diet and exercise, drink a quart of kale juice a day, cleanse and undergo our colonic intrusions. Yes, there&#x2019;s a biological reality, a ticking clock. You don&#x2019;t control that, unfortunately. But there&#x2019;s also a way of aging that might allow you to age longer. The atmospheric and attitudinal, what you surround yourself with, or how you accept what comes your way. Somewhere in all of this, I realized that if the internal clock is perhaps genetically preprogrammed, then this other half of it is worth searching for. How did these old guys relate to their oldness and to the physical reality of getting oldand was there anything in my atmospheric and attitudinal self that might suggest that I could, too?</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.28"><strong>WILLIAM DEL MONTE</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.29"><strong>Lesson one:</strong> Time is precious. Especially when you&#x2019;ve had more of it than anyone else.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2a">Ahead of my planned trip to California to visit the other olds, I left messages and sent e-mails to the director of the nursing home in which one William Del Monte resides. News clips had it that he was the only living male survivor of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, having been three months old at the time and spirited by his mother through the streets of the fiery city wrapped in a tablecloth. Of Italian heritage, he, too, had been married without children. (Was that the secret, no children?) While initially the nursing home expressed optimism about our meetingafter all, Del Monte could be found on a YouTube video sharing some rambling reminiscences about his life, about swimming naked in the Bay as a kid or taking his tip money as a hatcheck boy and investing it in the stock market, claiming that he lost about a million dollars in the 1929 stock market crashI couldn&#x2019;t persuade him to meet.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2b">&quot;I&#x2019;m 109,&quot; said Del Monte through his proxy. &quot;I don&#x2019;t have time for this stuff.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2c"><strong>ANDREW HATCH</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2d"><strong>Thankfully, there was</strong> another supercentenarian just over the bridge in Oakland, Andrew Hatch, whom I soon found in a modest house just off 580, where the reception was so warm I felt a little like a blood relation. If his birth date was to be believed, Andrew might have been the oldest man ever recorded. (The oldest fully verified living American man is a 109-year-old in Nebraska.) Andrew&#x2019;s census records, as reliable as Wash&#x2019;s, indicated a birth year of 1905. But he wasn&#x2019;t looking for the title, far from it. He was just certain he&#x2019;d been born on October 7, 1898. And he had a special memory for facts.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2e">He, too, had been born in the Deep South, in Louisiana. He, too, was African-American and didn&#x2019;t possess a birth certificate. He, too, didn&#x2019;t wear dentures, so you had to lean in to understand his euphoric chitter-chatter, which in his case sometimes jumped over into Spanish, a result of five years in Mexico. Most important, he was an anomaly in this rare stratum of super-old men. He, unlike the others, was <em>not</em> childless; he had a daughter, named Delane, who&#x2019;d arrived in his life quite late, when he was about 60. She took care of him at her house now, after he&#x2019;d been found in his old apartment last spring, unconscious. Prior to that, he was famous for riding his sit-down scooter everywhere. There were days when he disappeared for up to eight hours on that scooter. If he wanted to see downtown, he might scooter downtown.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2f">Now, however, he was set up in a bed, in the living room, the sound of 580 like a river rushing beyond the window. When Delane was born, Andrew was at a moment when he needed saving. He was deep into the bottle, not taking care of himself. He&#x2019;d been a cabdriver in Oakland and knew that city as well, or better, than anyone. He knew where the politicians went late at night, and he knew who went home with whom. He was such an extrovert, and such an affable one. But he was so footloose as to have maybe lost the thread of meaning in his life. And Delane changed that. Instantly. He made a promise to himself that although he wasn&#x2019;t going to marry Delane&#x2019;s mother (they remained close friends), he was going to be a real father to her. So he gave up booze and never drank again, as far as anyone could tell. Now father and daughter kept themselves tightly threaded together.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2g">lesson two: If you have a reason for livingan ongoing call-and-responseyou might just keep on living.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2h">&quot;How you doing, Daddy?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2i">&quot;Real good.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2j">&quot;You want some gum, Daddy?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2k">&quot;I reckon so.&quot; (Andrew chewed so much Juicy Fruit his family claimed jokingly that they were going broke.)</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2l">&quot;You comfortable, Daddy?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2m">&quot;Oh yeah.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2n">Delane&#x2019;s sons, in their twenties and thirties, came and went, sitting with him, making time. One grandson had tight dreads that fell to the middle of his back, accompanied by an array of tattoos. He was a rapper, and he told me his grandfather, at his speculative age of 116, had recently been in a video he&#x2019;d shot. Andrew wore his trademark fedora, carried his trademark cane, and when it came time, he danced. Or moved like he was dancing. But still.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2o">He&#x2019;d been in a rap video, and no one seemed more pleased about it than him.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2p"><strong>WILLIAM</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2q"><strong>I confess, I had</strong> less-than-generous thoughts after the brush-off by William Del Monte. Really? <em>He</em> had no time? So what was taking up so much of his time? Sudoku? The Charleston? It was precisely because, at 109, William Del Monte didn&#x2019;t have &quot;time for this stuff that I wanted him to make &quot;time for this stuff. So I could ask him about time, and his management of it, his rejection of people like me, which gave him more time to pursue his own bliss. I&#x2019;ll tell you: I came to believe it had everything to do with the &quot;U-bend of happiness.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2r">The U-bend of happiness was described in a 2010 study of nearly 350,000 people, ranging from 18 to 80-plus, and it told me something I both wanted and didn&#x2019;t want to know. When asked by researchers to gauge their level of happiness based on, among other things, their levels of worry, those in the 20-to-30-year-old demographic felt pretty good. But from there, worry picked up fiercely, and happiness declined precipitously through middle age, hitting a nadir around the 50-year-old range, my range in fact. (And the moment when many parents are often dealing with teenage kids.)</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2s">But then an astonishing thing occurred: As people grew older, happiness started climbing againand then kept climbing and climbing the longer one livedpast those original levels of euphoric youth to previously uncharted heights. Summing up the phenomenon, <em>The Economist</em> wrote, &quot;Although as people move towards old age they lose things they treasurevitality, mental sharpness and looksthey also gain what people spend their lives pursuing: happiness.&quot; Perhaps, the article posited, it was because old people maintain, according to Stanford professor Laura Carstensen, &quot;the uniquely human ability to recognize our own mortality and monitor our own time horizons.&quot; The article continued:</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2t">Because the old know they are closer to death, [Carstensen] argues, they grow better at living for the present. They come to focus on things that matter nowsuch as feelingsand less on long-term goals. &quot;When young people look at older people, they think how terrifying it must be to be nearing the end of your life. But older people know what matters most.&quot; For instance, she says, &quot;young people will go to cocktail parties because they might meet somebody who will be useful to them in the future, even though nobody I know actually likes going to cocktail parties.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2u">So was that it in a nutshell? William Del Monte didn&#x2019;t need me as much as I needed him. He had his own scotch, his own party. He had the ice, and probably the Cole Porter records, too. On the U-bend of happiness, he was up, and I was down.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2v">Understanding time as he did, of course, William Del Monte clearly had none of it for this kind of stuff. And rightly so. He was living in a place called &quot;a nursing home,&quot; hermetically sealed and ostensibly happyand one would surmise he&#x2019;d settled his accounts maybe twenty years ago.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2w">lesson three, then: If the rest is gravy, it&#x2019;s up to you to make sure it is indeed gravy. That is, if you&#x2019;re living the afterlife to your own original life, you have to work from a simple principle: Knowing that this second life of yours is much more temporal and fragile than your first, do you really want to waste one second sharing your secrets with some schlub from <em>GQ?</em></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2x"><strong>CONRAD</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2y"><strong>Lesson four:</strong> Memory is sustaining, even when you doan remember nuttin&#x2019;.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.2z">Back in Conrad Johnson&#x2019;s room in Rockford, LaVerne tried to direct Conrad through a rapid-fire round of what I&#x2019;ll call &quot;I Remember.&quot; Before his stroke, Conrad walked for exercise each day, kept away from alcohol, drilled in on his finances. His mind was full and focused, clicking and whirring. After the stroke, he was more in and out, had little interest in his money, jumped from random memory to random memory, as if bog-hopping through space and time. He wore a yellow bracelet that identified him as a &quot;Fall Risk.&quot; He was belted to his Brody chair.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.30">&quot;Do you remember visiting the Holy Land?&quot; LaVerne asked, hoping to jog loose a story.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.31"><em>Doan remember.</em></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.32">&quot;With Walborg, your first wife?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.33"><em>Doan remember her.</em></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.34">After she died, he&#x2019;d remarried, at the age of 86. &quot;Do you remember Alice, your second wife?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.35"><em>Alice?</em></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.36">&quot;World War II, the Korean War?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.37"><em>Doan remember those.</em></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.38">&quot;Conrad, what were the best times?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.39"><em>Doan remember.

Then Conrad started talking again on his own, this time with absolute clarity of pronunciation, as if he&#x2019;d come upon a lost suitcase full of fond memories and opened it before our eyes.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3a"><em>We had woods and pumped water.

Andrew Hatch could remember an offense back in the old times, in the Deep South, called reckless eyeballing. Well, Andrew Hatch wasn&#x2019;t the sort to forgo proper appreciation for a pretty woman walking by on the street. You could invent laws to keep people from being human, but that didn&#x2019;t mean people had to obey them.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3l">So this was 1920s Irving, Texas, and this is how he remembered it: A white woman walked by. Whether Andrew even looked is debatable, but suddenly there was a mob, and he stood accused of reckless eyeballing. The instant judgment was hanging. He was thrown in a cell while everyone spread the word to gather later for the lynching.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3m">Thing was, Andrew&#x2019;s hidden talent was this innate ability to look at a lock, take a mental picture, and then fashion a key that would work to open it. He always carried a blank key and a little file, that was something even Delane remembered. In his 110-plus years, he&#x2019;d picked every kind of lock there was.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3n">And so he picked the one on the cell, and he saw himself out, and he fled to Mexico, where he lived for five years. When he came back to his home country, he decided to try California. Even years later, even now lying in his bed in Delane&#x2019;s living room next to the running river of 580, he sometimes grew a little paranoid that they were going to come for him, all those white people, that they were going to remind him he&#x2019;d broken the law, and this time they&#x2019;d empty his pockets and there&#x2019;d be no escape.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3o"><strong>WASH</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3p"><strong>He&#x2019;s the oldest</strong> registered driver in Illinois. He&#x2019;s required to renew his license every year by taking the test. What&#x2019;s there to study? He&#x2019;s been driving for about ninety-five years. Every year, he passes with flying colors.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3q">lesson five: Don&#x2019;t stop driving.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3r">Andrew</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3s"><strong>As it turns out,</strong> there&#x2019;s a jellyfish, <em>Turritopsis dohrnii,</em> known as the only creature on earth that exhibits a sort of immortality. When near death, it rejuvenates itself by shifting into something called a polyp state. So it literally reverts from sexual maturity to asexual immaturity, from adulthood to childhood. Under duress, it puts old cells to new use.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3t">This is really true: These jellyfish live a very long, as-yet-undocumented amount of time and are being studied for possible human benefits. But does it suggest the most obvious thing, that sex is not everything, or not even as life-giving as we think? Maybe the supercentenarian already knows something about this.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3u">&quot;I gave up women when I was 86,&quot; declares Andrew Hatch, propped in his bed. (One interesting similarity among supercentenarians seems to be this ability to give things up, to exhibit self-discipline, perhaps after a lack of it, sometimes after decades of lacking it, be it the instant cessation of cigarettes, booze in excess, women, whatever. Let&#x2019;s call that lesson six: Learn to give it up.)</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3v">But why give up women?</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3w">&quot;It wasn&#x2019;t that I didn&#x2019;t still love &#x2019;em,&quot; he says. &quot;I just had to quit &#x2019;em.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3x">&quot;He had a very good run,&quot; says Delane, winking. &quot;Ain&#x2019;t that right, Daddy?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3y">Andrew smiled at that, mischievously. It wasn&#x2019;t that his physical ability to continue liking them had gone defunct; it was that the intricacies of a sex-based relationship took so much time. And he had his daughter and grandkids, his friends and community. He spent his time scootering here and there, with no care in the world. Why did he need a woman?</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.3z">Immortal jellyfish or not, he wasn&#x2019;t trying to live longer, he was just trying to enjoy the time he had left. A big difference. In fact, it seemed that none of the decisions made by Wash or Conrad or Andrew were for the purpose of one day proclaiming the secrets of their radical longevity. They didn&#x2019;t eat less by adhering to the Confucian <em>hara hachi bu,</em> or spend years on a Himalayan quest to find their life&#x2019;s highest purpose. They didn&#x2019;t suddenly become extroverts, or develop an instant klatch of close friends, or drink Sardinian wine with three times the polyphenols. But what they did do was replace their vices with lesser ones as their lives took their various twists and turns. They kept loving and praying and doing for themselves, always doing for themselves, driving the car, doing the shopping, making the sandwich. The more physically limited they became, the more accepting they were. But that didn&#x2019;t mean they were giving up.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.40"><strong>WASH</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.41"><strong>&quot;Do you remember</strong> the best days of your life?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.42">&quot;<em>These</em> are the best days of my life! I can do anything I want to do. I can lay down whenever I want. I can drink Gatorade all day long.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.43"><strong>CONRAD</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.44"><strong>Wheeled in his</strong> Brody chair to lunch, he kept talking and talking, his young attendants, Natalia and Risa, laughing out loud at everything he said, though half of it was in Swedish. It was the way he said it, with such joyful insistence and glee, with little hisses of laughter. It was the most wonderful kind of asexual flirting to witness, a deeper kind of affection, and perhaps more true, because there was no desire for, or threat of, consummation.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.45">One of the attendants took some mashed potato and offered a cloud of it on a fork. He took it all gently in his mouth, like a careful baby watching his mother, gumming it until he could, within the bounds of good manners, call it macerated and swallowed. Then he continued on with his story, as if there were nothing more urgent in all the world.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.46">lesson seven: If you want to live a long time, then, keep chewing Juicy Fruit. Drink Gatorade whenever you want. Flirt and scooter. Continue on with your story.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.47">But of course, accept that the story ends, as well. It has to. We all know that. We really aren&#x2019;t jellyfish, after all.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.48">Maybe it comes, as it did for Conrad, on a December morning right before Christmas. Maybe it&#x2019;s the evening before you&#x2019;re going to die, and good old LaVerne is there as usual, and maybe he looks murkier through rheumy eyes, with that funny mustache. And maybe you tell all the stories again, or at least the ones about growing up in Sweden, because those seem to be exactly what you remember with a crystalline sort of recall: the farm, the girl that should have been yours. Maybe LaVerne shaves you like he always does. And then you have to feed the cows and pigs, because Daddy says so. And the nurses give a good-night peck on your forehead and you say, <em>Gahhhh! What about on the lips?</em> And burst into laughter at their surprise. Maybe you fall fast asleep and sleep a really wonderful sleep, so pure and deep you don&#x2019;t want to give it up in the morning, because the movies on the back of your eyelids are so familiar and beautiful.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.49">Maybe you wake to see the sun, or what the weather is doing, but that sleep, it calls you back with such insistence. So you roll over, take an easy breath, almost like a satisfied sigh.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.4a">And without even considering it, it happens to be your last.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.4b"><strong>WASH</strong></p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.4c"><strong>A story about really,</strong> really old men might rightly end with a funeral, for here&#x2019;s the thing, finally: A majority of Americans, when asked if they want to live forever, seem clear that they&#x2019;d like to live in good health until about 90. Only 8 percent of us say we want to live to 120. Whether we can&#x2019;t imagine a future in which our blood might be injected with disease-fighting nanobots, or can&#x2019;t imagine one in which our husbands and wives, our children and friends, all predecease us, life beyond a hundred seems a faraway scary place that gets a little closer when you meet the supercentenarians: Wash on his living room couch, even now worrying about two holes in his roof; or Conrad chattering his stories; or Andrew Hatch, surrounded by family, chomping gum. When you outlive all the people in the first half of your life, when the wrinkles have covered your body (or not) and you don&#x2019;t hear so well (or you secretly do), when you&#x2019;ve been disappointed by your new limitations and then have given up those disappointments, it&#x2019;s true you find yourself reborn, in a tight cluster with those from the second half of your life who gather a little more closely around you, to protect you, it seems.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.4d">One day I go to church with Wash, to his Wednesday prayer group, where he&#x2019;s greeted with great fanfare by the pastor, who&#x2019;s 83 himself and calls him &quot;Brother Wesley.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.4e">&quot;Lord,&quot; says the pastor to the dozen who&#x2019;ve gathered, &quot;we know we&#x2019;re here for only a short time. But I&#x2019;m ordering my steps now, Lord Jesus. He has granted me four score and three years. I ain&#x2019;t afraid. Who wants to be young? They don&#x2019;t know nothingand think they know everything! We shouldn&#x2019;t be ashamed of our age. Our age is a blessing!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.4f">To this, there are a lot of <em>Amen</em>s and <em>That&#x2019;s right</em>s. The pastor continues. &quot;There were those who walked and talked and ate with Jesus. Our privilege is to do the same with Brother Wesley. We don&#x2019;t need to wonder what 111 looks like! We live with him and talk with him. And I should say, this church is only 110 years old, one year younger than Brother Wesley.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.4g">This creates a titter of laughter. Wash betrays no sense that he&#x2019;s being talked about. Is he impervious? Unhearing? It seems to be the opposite. He&#x2019;s most pervious; the old man misses nothing. In fact, there&#x2019;s something steely and luminous inside himcall it willthat seems to bridge each day to the next. And maybe this is lesson eight: If you want to live a long time, you have to really really <em>want</em> to live a long time. And have your own deep-down reasons for living a long time, well after the temporal pursuits of recognition and moneyor even of the fleshare gone. When you&#x2019;re stripped clean of those, something else fills you, thena new spirit, or hope. The world holds its own infinity that is no bigger than your living room, or this church here. And it&#x2019;s yours to seize.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.4h">The pastor directs everyone to their songbooks and &quot;Go Tell It on the Mountain.&quot; Wash picks up his, perches his reading glasses on the bridge of his nose. Everyone begins to sing in unison, and at first his voice comes softly, almost tremulous and uncertain in that baritone. By the fourth verse, however, he is singing bright and clear, as if he&#x2019;s found his strength again.</p><p data-reactid=".26bn3rnfvgg.1.1.0.0.4.4i">He sings for yet another life after this one.
