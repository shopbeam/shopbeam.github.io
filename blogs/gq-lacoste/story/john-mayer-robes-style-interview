  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe first time we saw the cover of John Mayer\u0027s 2012 album, Paradise Valley, we double-took so hard we almost snapped a vertebrae. What happened to America\u0027s beloved celebrity panty-dropper, known for dressing like an overgrown teen in rare Nikes, cargo pants, and V-neck tees? This new guy looked like he\u0027d tripped out hard on a bunch of acid and CSNY vinyl, gone vision-questing across the denim shops of Japan, then returned to the Great Plains to rekindle his best-friendship with his long-lost Labrador. We were confused, curious, and impressed, and from that moment on, we began watching Mayer\u0027s style more closely. And what we found is that Mayer\u0027s intense passion for collecting Nikes and Rollies has now been redirected to the handmade, highly expensive, and extremely cultish Japanese brand Visvim, designed by a denim-whisperer named Hiroki Nakamura who is, in certain tiny circles, revered like a god. Here, we talk to the style-world\u0027s most hardwired collector about what happened to all his sneakers, how hiding under layers of indigo helped him through a career hiatus and a booze-heavy rough patch, and whether or not he really has a massive Visvim collection stashed in a storage space in Florida.\u000A\u000AGQ: How\u0027s it going?\u000A\u000AJohn Mayer: Hold on—let me finish tying my bow tie for this call.\u000A\u000AHa! Your local GQ representative thanks you for that. Only thing is I\u0027m in my pajamas.\u000A\u000AJust like a good New York writer. What are you drinking, bourbon?\u000A\u000AYes, and smoking a cigar. So let\u0027s talk about the evolution of your style, and about some of your collections. For starters: Do you still think of yourself as a sneaker collector?\u000A\u000ANo.\u000A\u000ABut there was a time where you were into it heavy, right?\u000A\u000AOh, I was into it, yeah. I think we all were. It was an extension of adolescence. Of baseball cards or something. All of my friends had closets—all you\u0027d see was Nike orange from all the bos. And I had \u0027em all. I think there was a Golden Age of it. There was the Air Max 360. There was the moment when they would put out all these great Air Max 90s. And I think what happened was that, for me and all my friends, it was supposed to make a market, but the market never got made. It was like, \u0022These are limited edition. I\u0027m gonna buy \u0027em for $85 and maybe I can weed and seed and sell them for $210 two years from now.\u0022 But the market never got made and people just looked around and went, Well, this is actually costing a lot of money.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m in way deeper than $85 now.\u0022\u000A\u000AYeah, you end up going, There\u0027s gotta be something else out there. But what was cool about the sneaker thing is it got people into physical product.\u000A\u000ARight. Sneakers are the gateway. So how much of that stuff do you still have?\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve given a lot of stuff away. I speak for a lot of former sneakerheads who are like, \u0022I can\u0027t start an eBay company to sell sneakers that are $25.\u0022 So you end up giving them to people who are your size. There are a couple of really cool things that I still have. Anything that\u0027s a collab: Futura has done it, Kaws has done it. Those things are interesting to hold onto. All of the Hiroshi Fujiwara Fragment stuff; anything that has that Harajuku vibe I think I\u0027ve held on to. But there was a time when they were coming out with a bunch of different colorways and naming it after what the colors represented. When you start getting into Air Max \u002795 Bacon and Eggs, you\u0027re like... Alright.\u000A\u000ABut it got me, and it got everyone I know, into the idea of the pursuit of physical product. Like, how many Drake records are there? The answer is as many as you want. In the face of this digital turnout of things, you go, \u0022I want to have something that not everybody has. I want something that differentiates me.\u0022\u000A\u000ADo you currently collect anything that you can\u0027t wear?\u000A\u000AYou know, there are certain things that I have in my collection that I would like to wear—I mean in my mind\u0027s eye, where I\u0027m a lot of things that I can\u0027t be in real life. And there have probably been times where I\u0027ve gone too far into the ambition of it rather than what the authentic vibe should be.\u000A\u000AOh, do you mean wearing something that you can\u0027t quite pull off?\u000A\u000AYeah. So I have a lot of old robes. A lot of Tibetan robes, and it\u0027ll end up in People magazine that I was wearing a bathrobe. And it\u0027s like, \u0022Well, actually it\u0027s a totally hand-painted, natural dye... It\u0027s made with real indigo and crushed up ladybugs!\u0022 So yeah, sometimes you\u0027ll buy something because there\u0027s something that strikes you about it, and you\u0027ll hang it up and you\u0027ll go, \u0022I don\u0027t know how yet, but someday...\u0022 And either times change or you see—this is very important, and I\u0027m not afraid to admit this—you see someone else you look up to contextualize it in a way that allows you to find your way into wearing it. All of fashion is completely, one-thousand-percent context-based.\u000A\u000ACan you give an example?\u000A\u000AYeah, absolutely. If you go to Japan—Japan has these guys, some of them are designers, some of them are artists, and you see how they implement it, and what their point of reference is. I\u0027ve never stolen somebody\u0027s fashion, but I\u0027ve stolen people\u0027s points of reference.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s all we ever do.\u000A\u000AHere\u0027s a case in point: If your only reference to baggy jeans is Marky Mark or Kris Kross, then you won\u0027t want to wear them. But if your reference is like miners from the \u002740s—you look at a picture of people who were working around World War II and they\u0027re using rope to hold their jeans on because they didn\u0027t have a bunch of sizes back then—then you get into workwear. If that\u0027s your point of reference and you have a good song playing? That might just fuse into your brain.\u000A\u000ASo that\u0027s all it is for me. It\u0027s so much fun to collect points of reference, and pay homage or tribute to them, or bite a little bit. Who cares? You\u0027re allowed to bite, you know? What took me years to figure out is how to tailor it—no pun intended—to who I am, so you\u0027re not just walking around, like, displaying clothes on yourself.\u000A\u000ASo you\u0027re doing more than just walking around in someone else\u0027s context.\u000A\u000AYeah, you develop your own rules. Like, I\u0027ve got a rule: You only get a certain amount of flair points, and you can\u0027t spend too many points on one outfit.\u000A\u000ADo you have an actual number of points you stick to?\u000A\u000ANo, but I\u0027ll make it up! So if you\u0027re gonna wear a hat—which you absolutely can—that\u0027s most of your flair points.\u000A\u000AYou blew a big part of your budget right there.\u000A\u000ABig part of your budget on your hat. Or if you\u0027re just gonna wear jeans and a T-shirt, you can go nuts with the boots. And if you want to wear a white T-shirt and blue jeans, you can wear whatever you want over it—you can wear the weirdest Tibetan robe over it. That\u0027s your show-off moment.\u000A\u000AWho knows, maybe a few necklii...\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s right. A couple of necklii? Great. It just takes a while to fine-tune your ambition with the authenticity. I\u0027ll see somebody wearing a hat, and I know it\u0027s the closest thing they can find to the hat they have in their mind, and that\u0027s fine. Because I know it\u0027s a journey to the hat. You have to learn what\u0027s out there. It was a journey to my hat, and now I know the name of every crease you can get in a hat. I know every type of silhouette.\u000A\u000ADo you mean like every hat style from rodeo styles to workwear styles?\u000A\u000AYeah. You know, whether it\u0027s a Montana peak or whatever.\u000A\u000AWhat are you currently wearing?\u000A\u000AYou know, I watched Rio Grande—no, it was Rio Bravo, which is a different movie than Rio Grande, but they both have John Wayne in them... Anyway, John Wayne is wearing this cavalry hat that was just so badass. So I go, I want to wear that. So I had a copy of that hat made, and it just looks like the kind of hat you would drink water out of.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s been really fun going through Western movies and finding all the different ways you can wear a hat. I don\u0027t do it as much as I used to, because I feel like I\u0027ve completed the journey. You know, I got made fun of for the hat for a long time. And now I see a lot of people going for the hat. A lot of people.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s your reaction when you\u0027re ahead of the curve on something and you take shit for it?\u000A\u000AOh, I don\u0027t care. I don\u0027t care at all. There are a lot of stylish people who haven\u0027t branded themselves as such. There are a lot of secret style junkies out there, and I just haven\u0027t had the discussion with my publicist where I said, \u0022Make me the best dressed.\u0022 And a lot of times I\u0027m not the best dressed. Look at it like this: A lot of the best tattoo artists have some fucked up arms because they try stuff out on themselves.\u000A\u000ARight. Their knees—any place where they can tattoo themselves has some crazy shit going on.\u000A\u000ASo I try stuff out on myself. And the thing about wearing a Tibetan robe on an airplane is that you can use it for like six different things.\u000A\u000ASo a Tibetan robe is functional?\u000A\u000AYou can use it as a background to take pictures of things for Instagram. You can use it as a blanket. You can use it as a tent. I\u0027ve watched movies under it on the airplane—it\u0027s breathable! You can use it as a paparazzi shield. Maybe you get made fun of in People, but who knows who Hiroki Nakamura is that reads People magazine? Then there\u0027s one or two people who jump into the comments and go, \u0022No, actually that\u0027s Visvim. That\u0027s really hard to come by. That represents a lot of hard work by artisans in Japan.\u0022\u000A\u000AIf style is about sending out coded signals, I guess the People readership is not who you\u0027re sending your signals to.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s right. And this is some shit: Something you learn when you grow up is that everybody who is the \u0022worst dressed\u0022 is actually not the worst dressed. They\u0027re just trying to accelerate a little bit. People aren\u0027t idiots. They\u0027re not like, \u0022I think I want to wear this dumb thing to the Oscars.\u0022 They\u0027re worst dressed because they\u0027re outside of the norm. Then you get to be 27-years-old or something and you go, \u0022Oh, worst dressed just means ambitious.\u0022\u000A\u000ATo understand your style transformation and how you got to Tibetan robes, there are some points from your recent biography that I\u0027d like for us to try to connect. I\u0027m going to list them: Career hiatus, throat injury, Laurel Canyon, Bozeman, Born and Raised, Visvim, Japan, indigo, crushed-up ladybugs...\u000A\u000AI\u0027m probably still trying to connect those myself. Well, I\u0027m a big follower and collector of Visvim.\u000A\u000ADid it start with the shoes?\u000A\u000ANo, it was actually the opposite, because they didn\u0027t start making the shoes in size 12 until 2008 or 2009. You know, looking back on it—and, by the way, all that is completely authentic, it\u0027s not me sitting in a boardroom—I think part of the idea was hiding out. Sometimes, if you don\u0027t see the person you recognize in the mirror, then you\u0027re free from your own punishment. It\u0027s hard to explain. You\u0027re free from your own criticism. If you don\u0027t recognize the person you see in the mirror, then you\u0027re free from self-persecution.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s almost like a witness relocation program for yourself. Women do it, men do it. You have a change in your life, or a change in your philosophy, a change in your lifestyle, you have a loss, or you have heartache, so you go blonde or you grow a beard or you do both. Sometimes in life you just don\u0027t want to be recognizable to yourself. A lot of people get fucked up for that reason. I was drinking—I was drinking a whole hell of a lot. I was heavy, and layers favor the heavy man. I hope that ends up on top of a photo: \u0022Layers favor the heavy man.\u0022 [Laughs.]\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s helpful GQ style advice right there.\u000A\u000AWell, wearing layers is sort of like—just trying to get out of it by way of subterfuge. And then you get healthy again, and you put on your white tee and jeans and you\u0027re like bam!\u000A\u000ASo I think I was hiding out from myself. I was hiding out from what I felt like was a whole lot of pigeon-holing. And it\u0027s also the way I would do anything: [Collecting Visvim] became a pursuit. And it\u0027s bribery—it\u0027s self-bribery. A lot of times I don\u0027t want to get on an airplane unless there\u0027s something in it for me. And sometimes the only thing is the sort of intellectual or aesthetic adventure, and that\u0027s what gets me on the airplane. I said this quote one time: \u0022Don\u0027t pack for where you\u0027re going, pack for who you want to be when you get there.\u0022 So it\u0027s like, Okay, we\u0027ll do this flight in the \u002740s. We\u0027ll dress up. Or, we\u0027re gonna go to New York and do Spartan Pack: Just the perfect A-2 Bomber jacket, a bunch of different colored T-shirts, a couple different pairs of jeans, and some boots. And the rest of it we\u0027re gonna fill in with personality.\u000A\u000ACertain people seem to have an almost spiritual response to Visvim—as though the clothes are more than just inanimate objects. Is that part of what draws you to the brand?\u000A\u000AI think so. There\u0027s no other brand like it. It\u0027s fashion, but it\u0027s not. It\u0027s \u0022street fashion,\u0022 but it\u0027s not. These pieces transcend fashion or even clothing sometimes. It\u0027s what you might call an emotional connection with something material, you know? Like, I found the luckiest build of an A-2 bomber that Hiroki made for me. I\u0027m holding it right now.\u000A\u000AWhat do you mean by luckiest?\u000A\u000AYou get the right pieces of leather that work together, you know what I mean? It\u0027s just perfect. I wrote my name on the tag. I\u0027ve never written my name on the tag. It\u0027s one of those jackets that stands up on it\u0027s own, and I want to live inside it. I want to hide under it and sleep in it. It\u0027s just a jacket, right? But no, it\u0027s not just a jacket, because if you took it everywhere you went, it could be part of your story.\u000A\u000AAnd a leather jacket really is a second skin. That hide was alive for real at one point.\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve brought jackets on trips as a companion. You wake up in the morning in some city you don\u0027t-know-slash-don\u0027t-want-to-be-in, you throw on your watch and jacket and you go, \u0022Alright, here we go.\u0022 Me and my jacket have seen some weird shit.\u000A\u000AAnd I think Hiroki has created stuff with a depth to it. He\u0027s just trying to make the very best of each thing. What I\u0027m doing is trying to find each piece that sends the other pieces like it away. It really is like playing with your toys when you\u0027re a kid. You\u0027re just trying to complete something. You\u0027re going, \u0022I want the closet that is timeless and bulletproof.\u0022 Because, look, life can be very boring. This is just another way to add another little vibration. A little hum that goes under all of it that makes it a little more interesting. That\u0027s all.\u000A\u000AOkay, hear me out on this one: This being GQ, we do have a resident Visvim head. So earlier I said to him, \u0022I\u0027m talking to John Mayer today. What should I ask him?\u0022 And he said, \u0022I heard he has two of everything from Visvim—one that he wears, and one on ice. And the stuff that\u0027s on ice is in a storage space in Florida.\u0022\u000A\u000A[Laughs.] Um, I don\u0027t have two of every piece. I have a very healthy representation of each season. There are certain things that I think are so incredible, and that I don\u0027t believe are gonna be made again, so I like to have a couple versions of them. I\u0027ve been known to keep things on ice, and there\u0027s a rather extensive collection in a storage space that\u0027s not in Florida. It\u0027s in California.\u000A\u000ALet the record show: Not in Florida. So one more question—What\u0027s the story behind the look you wore for the Paradise Valley album cover?\u000A\u000AHiroki styled that. I forgot to put him in the credits. He was in LA at the time, and he brought a bunch of stuff with him and put it together. I think I was protected in a sense by the fact that he styled it. I also believe that when you\u0027re taking a picture, you can be hyper-styled. I don\u0027t think I would\u0027ve ever walked around like that, but I think if you\u0027re taking a picture you can be more theatrical and more artistic. And I feel like that\u0027s a little honor to have a Hiroki-Nakamura-styled photo. That was his blanket, my hat, my dog...\u000A\u000A\u0022Dog, model\u0027s own.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s right: Dog appears courtesy of dog.",

saw the cover of John Mayer&apos;s 2012 album, <em>Paradise Valley</em>, we double-took so hard we almost snapped a vertebrae. What happened to America&apos;s beloved celebrity panty-dropper, known for dressing like an overgrown teen in rare Nikes, cargo pants, and V-neck tees? This new guy looked like he&apos;d tripped out <em>hard</em> on a bunch of acid and CSNY vinyl, gone vision-questing across the denim shops of Japan, then returned to the Great Plains to rekindle his best-friendship with his long-lost Labrador. We were confused, curious, and impressed, and from that moment on, we began watching Mayer&apos;s style more closely. And what we found is that Mayer&apos;s intense passion for collecting Nikes and Rollies has now been redirected to the handmade, highly expensive, and extremely cultish Japanese brand Visvim, designed by a denim-whisperer named Hiroki Nakamura who is, in certain tiny circles, revered like a god. Here, we talk to the style-world&apos;s most hardwired collector about what happened to all his sneakers, how hiding under layers of indigo helped him through a career hiatus and a booze-heavy rough patch, and whether or not he really has a massive Visvim collection stashed in a storage space in Florida.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>GQ: How&apos;s it going?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>John Mayer: </strong>Hold on&#x2014;let me finish tying my bow tie for this call.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Ha! Your local <em>GQ</em> representative thanks you for that. Only thing is I&apos;m in my pajamas.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.6">Just like a good New York writer. What are you drinking, bourbon?</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Yes, and smoking a cigar. So let&apos;s talk about the evolution of your style, and about some of your collections. For starters: Do you still think of yourself as a sneaker collector?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.8">No.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>But there was a time where you were into it heavy, right?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.a">Oh, I was into it, yeah. I think we all were. It was an extension of adolescence. Of baseball cards or something. All of my friends had closets&#x2014;all you&apos;d see was Nike orange from all the bos. And I had &apos;em all. I think there was a Golden Age of it. There was the Air Max 360. There was the moment when they would put out all these great Air Max 90s. And I think what happened was that, for me and all my friends, it was supposed to make a market, but the market never got made. It was like, &quot;These are limited edition. I&apos;m gonna buy &apos;em for $85 and maybe I can weed and seed and sell them for $210 two years from now.&quot; But the market never got made and people just looked around and went, Well, this is actually costing a lot of money.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>&quot;I&apos;m in way deeper than $85 now.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.c">Yeah, you end up going, There&apos;s gotta be something else out there. But what was cool about the sneaker thing is it got people into physical product.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Right. Sneakers are the gateway. So how much of that stuff do you still have?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.e">I&apos;ve given a lot of stuff away. I speak for a lot of former sneakerheads who are like, &quot;I can&apos;t start an eBay company to sell sneakers that are $25.&quot; So you end up giving them to people who are your size. There are a couple of really cool things that I still have. Anything that&apos;s a collab: Futura has done it, Kaws has done it. Those things are interesting to hold onto. All of the Hiroshi Fujiwara Fragment stuff; anything that has that Harajuku vibe I think I&apos;ve held on to. But there was a time when they were coming out with a bunch of different colorways and naming it after what the colors represented. When you start getting into Air Max &apos;95 Bacon and Eggs, you&apos;re like... Alright.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.f">But it got me, and it got everyone I know, into the idea of the pursuit of physical product. Like, how many Drake records are there? The answer is as many as you want. In the face of this digital turnout of things, you go, &quot;I want to have something that not everybody has. I want something that differentiates me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Do you currently collect anything that you can&apos;t wear?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.h">You know, there are certain things that I have in my collection that I would like to wear&#x2014;I mean in my mind&apos;s eye, where I&apos;m a lot of things that I can&apos;t be in real life. And there have probably been times where I&apos;ve gone too far into the ambition of it rather than what the authentic vibe should be.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Oh, do you mean wearing something that you can&apos;t quite pull off?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.j">Yeah. So I have a lot of old robes. A lot of Tibetan robes, and it&apos;ll end up in <em>People</em> magazine that I was wearing a bathrobe. And it&apos;s like, &quot;Well, actually it&apos;s a totally hand-painted, natural dye... It&apos;s made with real indigo and crushed up ladybugs!&quot; So yeah, sometimes you&apos;ll buy something because there&apos;s something that strikes you about it, and you&apos;ll hang it up and you&apos;ll go, &quot;I don&apos;t know how yet, but someday...&quot; And either times change or you see&#x2014;this is very important, and I&apos;m not afraid to admit this&#x2014;you see someone else you look up to contextualize it in a way that allows you to find your way into wearing it. All of fashion is completely, one-thousand-percent context-based.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Can you give an example?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.l">Yeah, absolutely. If you go to Japan&#x2014;Japan has these guys, some of them are designers, some of them are artists, and you see how they implement it, and what their point of reference is. I&apos;ve never stolen somebody&apos;s fashion, but I&apos;ve stolen people&apos;s points of reference.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.m">That&apos;s all we ever do.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.n">Here&apos;s a case in point: If your only reference to baggy jeans is Marky Mark or Kris Kross, then you won&apos;t want to wear them. But if your reference is like miners from the &apos;40s&#x2014;you look at a picture of people who were working around World War II and they&apos;re using rope to hold their jeans on because they didn&apos;t have a bunch of sizes back then&#x2014;then you get into workwear. If that&apos;s your point of reference and you have a good song playing? That might just fuse into your brain.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.o">So that&apos;s all it is for me. It&apos;s so much fun to collect points of reference, and pay homage or tribute to them, or bite a little bit. Who cares? You&apos;re allowed to bite, you know? What took me years to figure out is how to tailor it&#x2014;no pun intended&#x2014;to who I am, so you&apos;re not just walking around, like, displaying clothes on yourself.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>So you&apos;re doing more than just walking around in someone else&apos;s context.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.q">Yeah, you develop your own rules. Like, I&apos;ve got a rule: You only get a certain amount of flair points, and you can&apos;t spend too many points on one outfit.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>Do you have an actual number of points you stick to?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.s">No, but I&apos;ll make it up! So if you&apos;re gonna wear a hat&#x2014;which you absolutely can&#x2014;that&apos;s most of your flair points.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>You blew a big part of your budget right there.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.u">Big part of your budget on your hat. Or if you&apos;re just gonna wear jeans and a T-shirt, you can go nuts with the boots. And if you want to wear a white T-shirt and blue jeans, you can wear whatever you want over it&#x2014;you can wear the weirdest Tibetan robe over it. That&apos;s your show-off moment.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>Who knows, maybe a few necklii...</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.w">That&apos;s right. A couple of <em>necklii?</em> Great. It just takes a while to fine-tune your ambition with the authenticity. I&apos;ll see somebody wearing a hat, and I know it&apos;s the closest thing they can find to the hat they have in their mind, and that&apos;s fine. Because I know it&apos;s a journey to the hat. You have to learn what&apos;s out there. It was a journey to my hat, and now I know the name of every crease you can get in a hat. I know every type of silhouette.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>Do you mean like every hat style from rodeo styles to workwear styles?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.y">Yeah. You know, whether it&apos;s a Montana peak or whatever.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.z">W<strong>hat are you currently wearing?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.10">You know, I watched <em>Rio Grande</em>&#x2014;no, it was <em>Rio Bravo</em>, which is a different movie than <em>Rio Grande</em>, but they both have John Wayne in them... Anyway, John Wayne is wearing this cavalry hat that was just so badass. So I go, I want to wear that. So I had a copy of that hat made, and it just looks like the kind of hat you would drink water out of.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.11">It&apos;s been really fun going through Western movies and finding all the different ways you can wear a hat. I don&apos;t do it as much as I used to, because I feel like I&apos;ve completed the journey. You know, I got made fun of for the hat for a long time. And now I see a lot of people going for the hat. A <em>lot</em> of people.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.12"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>What&apos;s your reaction when you&apos;re ahead of the curve on something and you take shit for it?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.14">Oh, I don&apos;t care. I don&apos;t care at all. There are a lot of stylish people who haven&apos;t branded themselves as such. There are a lot of secret style junkies out there, and I just haven&apos;t had the discussion with my publicist where I said, &quot;Make me the best dressed.&quot; And a lot of times I&apos;m <em>not</em> the best dressed. Look at it like this: A lot of the best tattoo artists have some fucked up arms because they try stuff out on themselves.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>Right. Their knees&#x2014;any place where they can tattoo themselves has some crazy shit going on.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.16">So I try stuff out on myself. And the thing about wearing a Tibetan robe on an airplane is that you can use it for like six different things.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.17"><strong>So a Tibetan robe is functional?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.18">You can use it as a background to take pictures of things for Instagram. You can use it as a blanket. You can use it as a tent. I&apos;ve watched movies under it on the airplane&#x2014;it&apos;s breathable! You can use it as a paparazzi shield. Maybe you get made fun of in <em>People</em>, but who knows who Hiroki Nakamura is that reads <em>People</em> magazine? Then there&apos;s one or two people who jump into the comments and go, &quot;No, actually that&apos;s Visvim. That&apos;s really hard to come by. That represents a lot of hard work by artisans in Japan.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.19"><strong>If style is about sending out coded signals, I guess the <em>People </em>readership is not who you&apos;re sending your signals to.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1a">That&apos;s right. And this is some shit: Something you learn when you grow up is that everybody who is the &quot;worst dressed&quot; is actually not the worst dressed. They&apos;re just trying to accelerate a little bit. People aren&apos;t idiots. They&apos;re not like, &quot;I think I want to wear this dumb thing to the Oscars.&quot; They&apos;re worst dressed because they&apos;re outside of the norm. Then you get to be 27-years-old or something and you go, &quot;Oh, worst dressed just means ambitious.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><strong>To understand your style transformation and how you got to Tibetan robes, there are some points from your recent biography that I&apos;d like for us to try to connect. I&apos;m going to list them: Career hiatus, throat injury, Laurel Canyon, Bozeman, <em>Born and Raised</em>, Visvim, Japan, indigo, crushed-up ladybugs...</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1c">I&apos;m probably still trying to connect those myself. Well, I&apos;m a big follower and collector of Visvim.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><strong>Did it start with the shoes?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1e">No, it was actually the opposite, because they didn&apos;t start making the shoes in size 12 until 2008 or 2009. You know, looking back on it&#x2014;and, by the way, all that is completely authentic, it&apos;s not me sitting in a boardroom&#x2014;I think part of the idea was hiding out. Sometimes, if you don&apos;t see the person you recognize in the mirror, then you&apos;re free from your own punishment. It&apos;s hard to explain. You&apos;re free from your own criticism. If you don&apos;t recognize the person you see in the mirror, then you&apos;re free from self-persecution.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1f">It&apos;s almost like a witness relocation program for yourself. Women do it, men do it. You have a change in your life, or a change in your philosophy, a change in your lifestyle, you have a loss, or you have heartache, so you go blonde or you grow a beard or you do both. Sometimes in life you just don&apos;t want to be recognizable to yourself. A lot of people get fucked up for that reason. I was drinking&#x2014;I was drinking a whole hell of a lot. I was heavy, and layers favor the heavy man. I hope that ends up on top of a photo: &quot;Layers favor the heavy man.&quot; [<em>Laughs</em>.]</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><strong>That&apos;s helpful <em>GQ</em> style advice right there.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1h">Well, wearing layers is sort of like&#x2014;just trying to get out of it by way of subterfuge. And then you get healthy again, and you put on your white tee and jeans and you&apos;re like bam<em>!</em></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1i">So I think I was hiding out from myself. I was hiding out from what I felt like was a whole lot of pigeon-holing. And it&apos;s also the way I would do anything: [Collecting Visvim] became a pursuit. And it&apos;s bribery&#x2014;it&apos;s self-bribery. A lot of times I don&apos;t want to get on an airplane unless there&apos;s something in it for me. And sometimes the only thing is the sort of intellectual or aesthetic adventure, and that&apos;s what gets me on the airplane. I said this quote one time: &quot;Don&apos;t pack for where you&apos;re going, pack for who you want to be when you get there.&quot; So it&apos;s like, Okay, we&apos;ll do this flight in the &apos;40s. We&apos;ll dress up. Or, we&apos;re gonna go to New York and do Spartan Pack: Just the perfect A-2 Bomber jacket, a bunch of different colored T-shirts, a couple different pairs of jeans, and some boots. And the rest of it we&apos;re gonna fill in with personality.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1j"><strong>Certain people seem to have an almost spiritual response to Visvim&#x2014;as though the clothes are more than just inanimate objects. Is that part of what draws you to the brand?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1k">I think so. There&apos;s no other brand like it. It&apos;s fashion, but it&apos;s not. It&apos;s &quot;street fashion,&quot; but it&apos;s not. These pieces transcend fashion or even clothing sometimes. It&apos;s what you might call an emotional connection with something material, you know? Like, I found the luckiest build of an A-2 bomber that Hiroki made for me. I&apos;m holding it right now.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1l"><strong>What do you mean by luckiest?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1m">You get the right pieces of leather that work together, you know what I mean? It&apos;s just perfect. I wrote my name on the tag. I&apos;ve never written my name on the tag. It&apos;s one of those jackets that stands up on it&apos;s own, and I want to live inside it. I want to hide under it and sleep in it. It&apos;s just a jacket, right? But no, it&apos;s not just a jacket, because if you took it everywhere you went, it could be part of your story.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1n"><strong>And a leather jacket really is a second skin. That hide was alive for real at one point.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1o">I&apos;ve brought jackets on trips as a companion. You wake up in the morning in some city you don&apos;t-know-slash-don&apos;t-want-to-be-in, you throw on your watch and jacket and you go, &quot;Alright, here we go.&quot; Me and my jacket have seen some weird shit.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1p">And I think Hiroki has created stuff with a depth to it. He&apos;s just trying to make the very best of each thing. What I&apos;m doing is trying to find each piece that sends the other pieces like it away. It really is like playing with your toys when you&apos;re a kid. You&apos;re just trying to complete something. You&apos;re going, &quot;I want the closet that is timeless and bulletproof.&quot; Because, look, life can be very boring. This is just another way to add another little vibration. A little hum that goes under all of it that makes it a little more interesting. That&apos;s all.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1q"><strong>Okay, hear me out on this one: This being <em>GQ,</em> we do have a resident Visvim head. So earlier I said to him, &quot;I&apos;m talking to John Mayer today. What should I ask him?&quot; And he said, &quot;I heard he has two of everything from Visvim&#x2014;one that he wears, and one on ice. And the stuff that&apos;s on ice is in a storage space in Florida.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1r"><em>[Laughs.] </em>Um, I don&apos;t have two of every piece. I have a very healthy representation of each season. There are certain things that I think are so incredible, and that I don&apos;t believe are gonna be made again, so I like to have a couple versions of them. I&apos;ve been known to keep things on ice, and there&apos;s a rather extensive collection in a storage space that&apos;s not in Florida. It&apos;s in California.</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1s"><strong>Let the record show: Not in Florida. So one more question&#x2014;What&apos;s the story behind the look you wore for the <em>Paradise Valley</em> album cover?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1t">Hiroki styled that. I forgot to put him in the credits. He was in LA at the time, and he brought a bunch of stuff with him and put it together. I think I was protected in a sense by the fact that he styled it. I also believe that when you&apos;re taking a picture, you can be hyper-styled. I don&apos;t think I would&apos;ve ever walked around like that, but I think if you&apos;re taking a picture you can be more theatrical and more artistic. And I feel like that&apos;s a little honor to have a Hiroki-Nakamura-styled photo. That was his blanket, my hat, my dog...</p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1u"><strong>&quot;Dog, model&apos;s own.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.4.1v">That&apos;s right: Dog appears courtesy of dog.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".bf3zz8zz0g.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
