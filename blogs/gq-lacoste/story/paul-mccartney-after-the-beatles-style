  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestMan On The RunAs the Beatles were splitting, McCartney fled to the country with his family—including baby Mary, riding shotgun here—\u000Aand his style unraveled in the best way possible.© 1975 Paul McCartney / Photographer: Linda McCartney. All rights reserved.\u000A\u000AAt the time, many people thought he was dead. This suited him, and some days he even acted as if it were true. He let his beard grow. He lay very still in bed. He grimaced and stared at the ceiling and smoked or drank whiskey. Nobody bothered him much, out in the vast anonymity of Scotland, but when they did it was inevitably weird and fraught—one Life magazine photographer recalls him hurling a bucket of food scraps in the direction of his lens after he\u0027d knocked on the door. This was late October 1969. Ever politic, even in his feral state, he eventually put down the bucket and posed, he and Linda and their two daughters looking shaggy and a bit startled out in the windy hills of their property. One of those photos made the Life cover the following week, and this was how the world found out that Paul McCartney was still alive. \u0022The Case of the ‘Missing\u0027 Beatle: Paul is still with us,\u0022 the cover line read. And he was, sort of.\u000A\u000AThe Beatles were on the verge of splitting up, though the world didn\u0027t quite know it yet. McCartney, grieving the loss and exhausted by all the attention to which he\u0027d had to become accustomed—attention so unrelenting that when he briefly disappeared, rumor immediately declared him deceased—retreated with his family to High Park Farm, a tax shelter of a property he owned but barely visited in Scotland. Looking back on it now, it was almost like a psychic witness-protection program, the way guys like McCartney or Bob Dylan up and vanished there at the vengeful end of the decade. They were people in whom so much was invested that they went into hiding just to cope. The Beatles were crawling toward one death, the psychedelic \u002760s toward another. It was the moment all the idealism and pent-up energy of the past few bright years had gone sideways and sour. So McCartney went and lay in mud and grew marijuana plants. Dying, he later said, \u0022took a lot out of me.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestStyle Runs in The FamilyLooks like Stella McCartney picked up some knitwear cues from her dad before launching her line.\u000A\u000AEventually he got out of bed, or more accurately Linda got him out of bed, and in turn she became both the impetus and inspiration of McCartney, the shambling, mostly home-recorded solo album Paul released the following April, three weeks before what would turn out to be the Beatles\u0027 final document, Let It Be. Most of the songs were about being in love and staying inside, because that\u0027s what McCartney had spent the past year doing. In a press release for the record, he conducted a mock interview with himself in which he implied the Beatles were over—as it turned out, they were—and then asked himself about his future plans. \u0022My only plan,\u0022 Paul McCartney told Paul McCartney, \u0022is to grow up.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo commenced a brief but magical moment where McCartney, dopey corny smiley McCartney, stopped trying to please anyone but himself. He was 27, then 28, and for the first time since meeting John Lennon he was on his own—there were no personalities to wrangle, no outfits to coordinate, no world-beating band in which to lose himself. He tried on moods and identities like a fugitive switching costumes. In 1971 people reported seeing him wandering New York in a beard, a combat jacket, and jeans, sitting on park benches, staring off into space. He would have Linda call around and recruit new studio musicians for mysterious projects she could only hint at over the phone; then he would emerge from the dark for late-night studio sessions wearing old beat-up sweaters, the amnesiac outfit of a Beatle trying to forget he\u0027d been a Beatle.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest(Left) The ShamenThe vision quest didn\u0027tstop with Sgt. Pepper\u0027s.(Right) The Family GuyWho needs a band when you\u0027ve got your best friends?\u000A\u000AHe was doing complicated, obscurely meaningful things with clothes—going to court, in 1971, to dissolve the Beatles\u0027 partnership in the same suit he\u0027d worn to cross the street on the cover of Abbey Road. He\u0027d thrift giant coats and walk around in a tangle of tweed. A mullet came and went, as did the giant, untamed beard, as he drank ever deeper from that rare cocktail of money and exile and creative prime in which everything is elevated, even style. Maybe especially style. Think of the Rolling Stones in the South of France, recording Exile on Main St., barefoot and shirtless and surrounded by women. They walked around in flowing pajama pants and looked like gods. Dylan in seclusion up in Woodstock, wearing an odd hat, years going by like hours. Kanye West recording My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in Hawaii, sunglasses and a T-shirt and a heavy heart. These were people who had attained their own gravity, like little planets. They reordered the world around themselves.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest(Left) The FarmhandIn Scotland, Paul dressed like his neighbors, but with a psychedelic twist.(Right) The PeacenikCopy everything but the hair and the studs.\u000A\u000AA further aside here, about rock-star style. For most of us style is fundamentally practical, a way to make our way through the office that day, or through the bar that evening. Our outfits must be able to survive the harsh fluorescent light of a subway car and the mockery of Tim in sales and the appraising glance of whoever might be two tables over at a restaurant during dinner. But rock stars make their own worlds—they appear on stages, private-jet runways, in mansions in exotic locales, and so their clothes need only respond to those elevated circumstances. We cannot hope to imitate the specifics of their outfits, their spangled American-flag spandex and fringy leather pants and improbable hair, because we have to answer to bad lighting and strangers and taking out the trash. But we can imitate their comfort, their ease, as they wear these preposterous things.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestA Very Different Kind Of Photo ShootPaul\u0027s most stylish era could\u0027ve gone undocumented; luckily Linda was as good with a camera as Paul was with a guitar, and the couple spent their days shooting family photos.© 1970 Paul McCartney / Photographer: Linda McCartney. All rights reserved.\u000A\u000ASo let us return to High Park Farm in Scotland, where Linda has purchased a tractor for Paul for Christmas and he\u0027s riding it around the property in some version of a ski cap, a camel coat, a turtleneck, outfits loosely thrown together for warmth, or because they were antithetical to the outfits he had worn before, or both. He\u0027s working on some songs. He\u0027s dressed like a gentleman farmer under the influence of a great deal of marijuana, which in fact he was at that moment. It is the look of a man who is free to wear Wellington boots, to pose in a short-sleeve Henley on the cover of his next album, 1971\u0027s Ram, holding the horns of an actual ram. Ram was loose and sweet and prominently featured Linda singing wildly off-key, because why not, and the McCartney family\u0027s style and sound were as one: A man with a beard had made these songs after riding a horse to write music every day in a barn over the hill, while running from a past life headlong into a new one. None of the other Beatles liked Ram. That was partly the point.\u000A\u000ASoon would come Wings, and Band on the Run, and McCartney would shave, go back to the arenas he\u0027d known as a Beatle. By the end of the decade Wings would sell so many records—more than 100 million!—that the Guinness Book of World Records, in lieu of a better idea, would hand McCartney a trophy made of pure rhodium, an element even more expensive than platinum. But right now he\u0027s still got the sheep by the horns. He\u0027s in the mud, somewhere far away. He\u0027s dressed like a man who\u0027s never going back.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestHappiness is A Warm CoatAnd we\u0027re not talking about the sheepdog. Paul\u0027s cozy tweed is back in style.© 1968 Paul McCartney Photographer: Linda McCartney. All rights reserved.",

This suited him, and some days he even acted as if it were true. He let his beard grow. He lay very still in bed. He grimaced and stared at the ceiling and smoked or drank whiskey. Nobody bothered him much, out in the vast anonymity of Scotland, but when they did it was inevitably weird and fraught&#x2014;one <em>Life</em> magazine photographer recalls him hurling a bucket of food scraps in the direction of his lens after he&apos;d knocked on the door. This was late October 1969. Ever politic, even in his feral state, he eventually put down the bucket and posed, he and Linda and their two daughters looking shaggy and a bit startled out in the windy hills of their property. One of those photos made the <em>Life</em> cover the following week, and this was how the world found out that Paul McCartney was still alive. &#x201C;The Case of the &#x2018;Missing&#x2019; Beatle: Paul is still with us,&#x201D; the cover line read. And he was, sort of.</p><p data-reactid=".17r7fgo2rk0.1.1.0.0.4.2">The Beatles were on the verge of splitting up, though the world didn&apos;t quite know it yet. McCartney, grieving the loss and exhausted by all the attention to which he&apos;d had to become accustomed&#x2014;attention so unrelenting that when he briefly disappeared, rumor immediately declared him deceased&#x2014;retreated with his family to High Park Farm, a tax shelter of a property he owned but barely visited in Scotland. Looking back on it now, it was almost like a psychic witness-protection program, the way guys like McCartney or Bob Dylan up and vanished there at the vengeful end of the decade. They were people in whom so much was invested that they went into hiding just to cope. The Beatles were crawling toward one death, the psychedelic &apos;60s toward another. It was the moment all the idealism and pent-up energy of the past few bright years had gone sideways and sour. So McCartney went and lay in mud and grew marijuana plants. Dying, he later said, &#x201C;took a lot out of me.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".17r7fgo2rk0.1.1.0.0.4.3"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5601c28e00a6dc503f9b96de/master/w_806/paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-02.jpg" alt="paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;t=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;t=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5601c28e00a6dc503f9b96de%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpaul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-02.jpg&amp;description=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5601c28e00a6dc503f9b96de%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpaul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-02.jpg&amp;description=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p><strong>Style Runs in The Family</strong><br>Looks like Stella McCartney picked up some knitwear cues from her dad before launching her line.</p></span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".17r7fgo2rk0.1.1.0.0.4.5">Eventually he got out of bed, or more accurately Linda got him out of bed, and in turn she became both the impetus and inspiration of <em>McCartney,</em> the shambling, mostly home-recorded solo album Paul released the following April, three weeks before what would turn out to be the Beatles&apos; final document, <em>Let It Be.</em> Most of the songs were about being in love and staying inside, because that&apos;s what McCartney had spent the past year doing. In a press release for the record, he conducted a mock interview with himself in which he implied the Beatles were over&#x2014;as it turned out, they were&#x2014;and then asked himself about his future plans. &#x201C;My only plan,&#x201D; Paul McCartney told Paul McCartney, &#x201C;is to grow up.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".17r7fgo2rk0.1.1.0.0.4.6">So commenced a brief but magical moment where McCartney, dopey corny smiley McCartney, stopped trying to please anyone but himself. He was 27, then 28, and for the first time since meeting John Lennon he was on his own&#x2014;there were no personalities to wrangle, no outfits to coordinate, no world-beating band in which to lose himself. He tried on moods and identities like a fugitive switching costumes. In 1971 people reported seeing him wandering New York in a beard, a combat jacket, and jeans, sitting on park benches, staring off into space. He would have Linda call around and recruit new studio musicians for mysterious projects she could only hint at over the phone; then he would emerge from the dark for late-night studio sessions wearing old beat-up sweaters, the amnesiac outfit of a Beatle trying to forget he&apos;d been a Beatle.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".17r7fgo2rk0.1.1.0.0.4.7"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5601ca6af0075b5033a11bab/master/w_806/paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-2-images.jpg" alt="paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-2-images.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;t=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-2-images.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;t=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-2-images.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5601ca6af0075b5033a11bab%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpaul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-2-images.jpg&amp;description=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-2-images.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5601ca6af0075b5033a11bab%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpaul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-2-images.jpg&amp;description=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-2-images.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>(Left) <strong>The Shamen</strong><br>The vision quest didn&#x2019;tstop with Sgt.

A mullet came and went, as did the giant, untamed beard, as he drank ever deeper from that rare cocktail of money and exile and creative prime in which everything is elevated, even style. Maybe especially style. Think of the Rolling Stones in the South of France, recording <em>Exile on Main St.,</em> barefoot and shirtless and surrounded by women. They walked around in flowing pajama pants and looked like gods. Dylan in seclusion up in Woodstock, wearing an odd hat, years going by like hours. Kanye West recording <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em> in Hawaii, sunglasses and a T-shirt and a heavy heart. These were people who had attained their own gravity, like little planets.

Our outfits must be able to survive the harsh fluorescent light of a subway car and the mockery of Tim in sales and the appraising glance of whoever might be two tables over at a restaurant during dinner. But rock stars make their own worlds&#x2014;they appear on stages, private-jet runways, in mansions in exotic locales, and so their clothes need only respond to those elevated circumstances. We cannot hope to imitate the specifics of their outfits, their spangled American-flag spandex and fringy leather pants and improbable hair, because we have to answer to bad lighting and strangers and taking out the trash. But we can imitate their comfort, their ease, as they wear these preposterous things.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".17r7fgo2rk0.1.1.0.0.4.b"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5601c293f0075b5033a11ab7/master/w_600/paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-09.jpg" alt="paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-09.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;t=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-09.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;t=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-09.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5601c293f0075b5033a11ab7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpaul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-09.jpg&amp;description=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-09.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5601c293f0075b5033a11ab7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpaul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-09.jpg&amp;description=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-09.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p><strong>A Very Different Kind Of Photo Shoot</strong><br>Paul&#x2019;s most stylish era could&#x2019;ve gone undocumented; luckily Linda was as good with a camera as Paul was with a guitar, and the couple spent their days shooting family photos.</p></span><div class="credits">&#xA9; 1970 Paul McCartney / Photographer: Linda McCartney.

He&apos;s working on some songs. He&apos;s dressed like a gentleman farmer under the influence of a great deal of marijuana, which in fact he was at that moment. It is the look of a man who is free to wear Wellington boots, to pose in a short-sleeve Henley on the cover of his next album, 1971&apos;s <em>Ram,</em> holding the horns of an actual ram. <em>Ram</em> was loose and sweet and prominently featured Linda singing wildly off-key, because why not, and the McCartney family&apos;s style and sound were as one: A man with a beard had made these songs after riding a horse to write music every day in a barn over the hill, while running from a past life headlong into a new one. None of the other Beatles liked <em>Ram.</em> That was partly the point.</p><p data-reactid=".17r7fgo2rk0.1.1.0.0.4.d">Soon would come Wings, and <em>Band on the Run,</em> and McCartney would shave, go back to the arenas he&apos;d known as a Beatle. By the end of the decade Wings would sell so many records&#x2014;more than 100 million!&#x2014;that the <em>Guinness Book of World Records,</em> in lieu of a better idea, would hand McCartney a trophy made of pure rhodium, an element even more expensive than platinum. But right now he&apos;s still got the sheep by the horns. He&apos;s in the mud, somewhere far away. He&apos;s dressed like a man who&apos;s never going back.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".17r7fgo2rk0.1.1.0.0.4.e"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5601c293f0075b5033a11aba/master/w_806/paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-10.jpg" alt="paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-10.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;t=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-10.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;t=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-10.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5601c293f0075b5033a11aba%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpaul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-10.jpg&amp;description=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-10.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpaul-mccartney-after-the-beatles-style&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5601c293f0075b5033a11aba%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpaul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-10.jpg&amp;description=paul-mccartney-gq-2015-sip-10.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p><strong>Happiness is A Warm Coat</strong><br>And we&#x2019;re not talking about the sheepdog.
