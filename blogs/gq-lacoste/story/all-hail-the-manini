  	    "articleBody": "To herald the conclusion of National Panini Month, we give you: The Manini.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWait, you\u0027re probably wondering. Paninis had their own month? Indeed, says Josh Scherer, the 23-year-old guy behind the meat-packed monstrosity pictured above. \u0022Because if made-up food holidays are no longer sacred, what is?\u0022 As the voice behind the uproarious food blog Culinary Brodown, Scherer has something of a unique worldview that refracts deep-fried bro gluttony through a thoughtful, academic lens. And that sort of brand dissonance has served him well: Those 41.5k Instagram fans didn\u0027t come out of nowhere. (He admits he even wants to build a Pinterest following.) While the LA-based food writer may don the occasional neon tank top, his hands-on cooking experience and food essays for Maxim and Los Angeles Magazine seem to indicate there\u0027s lot more on his mind than beef and beer. One thing is clear: He ain\u0027t just the next Guy Fieri.\u000A\u000ASo the name. Let\u0027s talk about the name. Where did the name come from?This sounds too good to be true, but it was made up by a drunk stranger at a party. I was kicking around ideas with a roommate during my first year at UCLA, and I told him, \u0022I want to start a food blog and play off the idea of \u0022bro food\u0022 because that\u0027d be a hilarious caricature to write from—something that\u0027s authentic but also rooted in creativity.  We tried throwing out bro food puns and couldn\u0027t think of any. This drunk stranger, who I only know as \u0022the guy my Italian roommate would play basketball and smoke pot with sometimes,\u0022 is laying stoned on the couch and he\u0027s like, \u0022Culinary Brodown!\u0022 I was like, \u0022Yeah, I can work with that.\u0022\u000A\u000AYour foodie bonafides seem to check out. It seems you\u0027ve read Tom Colicchio\u0027s  Think Like a Chef,  interned at an LA gastropub called Plan Check, and studied with celebrity cook Kris Morningstar, right?Studied is a heavy word for what Kris and I did. We cooked a lot, drank a lot of champagne in alleys, and ate foie gras while it was still illegal.\u000A\u000AHow did you meet him?An LA studio was testing out a reality television show concept of food bloggers challenging actual chefs. It was meant to shame bloggers. Like, \u0022Look how much of an asshole you are, criticizing someone else\u0027s food when you can\u0027t even cook.\u0022\u000A\u000AMorningstar tends to not like people from culinary school. His sous chef right now used to be a fullback at UCLA and most of his other staff members are former athletes. [Scherer was on the track &amp; field team in college] He was like, \u0022You really fit the bill, if you want to come cook at this pop up with me.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe offered me a position in his kitchen, but then I got a full time job as an editor. It\u0027s easier to sit in a desk and criticize food than to actually make food, which I guess would be proving the point of that TV show…\u000A\u000AI found a picture online of you and Guy Fieri. What\u0027s the story? Is he really one of your heroes?He\u0027s the hero and anti-hero at the same time. Everything you see on TV is a caricature, but chefs will attest that he\u0027s actually a hell of a cook. He\u0027s just found a niche where he can exploit for the most amount of money and give himself the biggest platform. The question I always wrestle with is, \u0022Would I not do the same if I were in his shoes?\u0022 That\u0027s always drawn me to him in a weird way.\u000A\u000ASo, a year ago three friends and I drove up to Santa Rosa to visit three of his restaurants in one night. We got full meals at each one and got hammered drunk. The food is absolutely terrible, but all of his cocktails are in fishbowls for $20. When we got to the third restaurant, it was rented out for Guy \u0027s son\u0027s birthday. I went to the bouncer and was like, \u0022Hey, man. We drove 1,000 miles to get here blah blah blah.\u0022 He went and got a bigger bouncer and then he got the General Manager. Eventually Guy Fieri came out, and he just goes, \u0022Hey, who the fuck is trying to take a picture of me?\u0022 We\u0027re like, \u0022Whoa. What? What?\u0022 He\u0027s like, \u0022I\u0027m just kidding, bros!\u0027 Then he hugs all of us and invites us inside and we have drinks and chicken wings.\u000A\u000AAccording to the early days of your blog, your \u0022culinary worldview\u0022 was shaped by \u0022drinking on a lawn, cooking for friends, and watching food network while intoxicated?\u0022 That changed much?No, not at all. I was on a food-centric trip to Israel last week, and the first day we were there I was asking our tour guide, \u0022Hey, what are the McDonald\u0027s like? Do they source from a higher quality place? What kind of energy drinks do Israelis drink considering their big club culture?\u0022 Later on, he stopped me and said, \u0022I think I figured it out, man. You\u0027re just interested in smut. You just want to know all the smut food that people eat.\u0022 I have a really earnest, almost academic, interest in the idea of bad food and people eating things that are terrible for them.\u000A\u000AErgo, the way of the \u0022Bro.\u0022 This term is usually a pejorative for oblivious meatheads. But you seem pretty self-aware.    I definitely wouldn\u0027t call myself a bro in the least. I\u0027m an anti-bro in a lot of ways. But, I\u0027m big, I wear backwards hats sometimes, and I hang out with a lot of other men. It was a label that was put on me. I think when you stereotype people, they work to live up to those. I figured I might as well own it and have an outlet to take my own direction and spin on it.\u000A\u000ADo you actually use a Smirnoff bottle for a rolling pin, or is that just a metaphor?I used to, but now I live with my girlfriend who has fancy baking equipment. But it\u0027s funny, I was making a recipe this past weekend for some, like, Pop-Tart deal. I was rolling out puff pastry and I grabbed an empty wine bottle. She was like, \u0022What are you doing? We have a really nice rolling pin.\u0022 I was like, \u0022That\u0027s too heavy. It\u0027ll crush the pastry,\u0022 and I insisted on using this empty wine bottle.\u000A\u000AA wine bottle still feels like an upgrade! The food blog was created to get you a job, right? That worked. What\u0027s next?I have a good literary agent and I do want to write a book based off the blog, expand that whole natty-light fueled culinary thesis.\u000A\u000ADuring your extensive research for said thesis, what have you noticed that\u0027s wrong with the foodie scene right now?Shitty food bloggers. Everyone has the same opinions and everyone writes the same way. A girl I went to Israel with wrote an Instagram caption about hummus: \u0022I can\u0027t believe that this one dish has the power to unite an entire nation. Ground chickpeas and tahini are the keys to unity.\u0022 I\u0027m like, \u0022Yeah? You wanna bring a fucking bowl of hummus into Gaza and see what happens?\u0022 No, not all food is a metaphor. Not all food brings people together. It\u0027s romanticized in a shitty way that\u0027s actually destructive to the way people think.\u000A\u000ASo how is Culinay Brodown trying to do right by the world?I started thinking about what I want to be known for. Shock food or stunt food, the idea of mashing things together and throwing them out to the Internet, blew up pretty recently. People are rolling shit in bacon and peanut butter and deep-frying it, even if it doesn\u0027t make any sense. It seems like the craft in it is dead. I\u0027m trying to be clever and crafty with it. Someone sees a ridiculous name like \u0022Culinary Brodown,\u0022 but then they see some ostentatious cheeseburger staring them in the face. They realize, \u0022Holy shit. Did he make a Charred Leek Velouté? What the hell is happening?\u0022 I think I\u0027m setting my food up in a way that defies people\u0027s expectations.\u000A\u000AYou never just wanna make food? Your food has to \u0022say something?\u0022I don\u0027t think I could make food for the sake of food if I tried. It feels unnatural to say I made this taco because I wanted to put it in my mouth.\u000A\u000ABut in order to appear on Culinary Brodown, does a recipe  have  to be an artery-choker? Is the health factor ever a consideration for you? I\u0027ve been relatively fat my entire life. But to be a shot put thrower, you had to be, so that was my crutch while making these crazy recipes. Now that I\u0027m sitting at a desk all day, I have to eat really clean in general. It\u0027s got me thinking about things in a new way. I don\u0027t think I can make a recipe that is terrible for people and morally justify it. Even if I\u0027m opening a conversation, I\u0027m still forwarding a broken system and doing it willingly. But, I also worry that I\u0027m in the wrong. On one hand, I\u0027m really fascinated with fast food. I love writing about it. I love eating it. Yet, I also understand how terrible it is for the world at large, health-wise, global-wise. It\u0027s meal colonialism.\u000A\u000ASounds like you\u0027re wrestling with some pretty heavy cognitive dissonance.[Laughs] Yeah, if you can\u0027t see the self-loathing in my recipes, you\u0027re not looking hard enough. Maybe that\u0027s my brand in a nutshell: Actively acting against my self interest…with bacon!\u0022\u000A\u000AHow did you come up with our Manini recipe?You just think of things that you would want to eat. Many of these ideas are pre-formed, floating around in my head. On a Wednesday evening, I couldn\u0027t just be like, \u0022I\u0027m going to cook a schnitzel and bratwurst and multiple cheese sandwich and eat that casually.\u0022 But if it\u0027s like, \u0022Hey, I\u0027m doing this because this is my job apparently,\u0022 it gives me an excuse.\u000A\u000AWhat about this sandwich distinguishes it as a \u0022Man-ini\u0022 and separates it from all other paninis?It\u0027s beautifully grotesque, in the fact that there are multiple preparations of meat of the same animal that are stacked on top of each other. You have grounded up pig on top of pounded out pig. It\u0027s all deep fried, and one of them is cooked in beer. That\u0027s kind of the definition of Main-ini, in a way.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhotos courtesy of Josh Scherer\u000A\u000AThe Fat Kraut (a.k.a. Augustus Gloop\u0027s Meat Sweats)\u000A\u000APork Schnitzel  \u000A\u000A1 boneless pork loin chop (8 oz)\u000Asalt to taste\u000A½ tsp. black pepper½ cup flour1 egg, whisked \u000A½ cup unseasoned bread crumbs1 tsp. smoked paprika1 tsp. roasted sesame seedscanola oil for cooking\u000A\u000A1) Remove any excess fat from the loin chop, then slice through the equator while leaving an attached hinge. That\u0027s called butterflying. Wrap the chop in plastic wrap, then use a tenderizing mallet—or a wine bottle—to pound the meat out flat. Season with salt and pepper.\u000A\u000A2) Set out three separate bowls. In one, add the flour; in another, add the egg; and in the third, toss in the breadcrumbs, paprika, sesame seeds, and 1 tsp. black pepper. Season each bowl with salt. \u000A\u000A3) Heat ½ inch of canola oil on medium-high in a heavy-bottomed pan, preferably cast iron. When the oil is shimmering and moving freely, add your pig cutlet. Cook for 3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and/or not completely raw.\u000A\u000AQuick-Pickled Red Onions  \u000A\u000A1 red onion¾ cup white vinegar1 tsp. sugar1 ½ tsp. kosher salt  \u000A\u000A1) Slice the red onion in half lengthwise, then cut into thin strips. Preserve in a Tupperware container or Mason jar\u000A\u000A2) Combine the rest of the ingredients in a small saucepan on high heat. Let come to a boil, whisk, then pour over the onion and let sit in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. (I threw some beet scraps into mine to make them extra purple.)\u000A\u000AHoreseradish Russian Dressing1 Tbsp. finely chopped onion1 Tbsp. chopped chives1 cup mayonaise¼ cup ketchup¼ cup prepared horseradish1 tsp. hot sauce1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce½ tsp. smoked paprikaSalt and pepper  \u000A\u000A1) Just...uhhh…just kinda mix it all together.\u000A\u000AAssembling the Manini:\u000A\u000A2 bratwursts2 thick slices rye bread4 slices Emmentaler cheese1 Tbsp. spicy brown mustard1 large piece of pork schnitzel¼ pound of Black Forest ham½ cup sauerkraut3 Tbsp. Horseradish Russian Dressing¼ cup Quick-Pickled Red OnionsPlenty of butter for frying\u000A\u000A1) Cook your bratwursts. There\u0027s no wrong way to go here: Bake, fry, grill, beer-poach, heat them over your car radiator—anything goes. Slice them in half lengthwise.\u000A\u000A2) Build your meat tower in the following order, from bottom to top: 1 slice of bread, 2 slices of cheese, mustard, pork schnitzel, Black Forest ham, bratwurst slices, sauerkraut, Horseradish Russian dressing, Quick-Pickled Red Onions, 2 more slices of cheese, then the top piece of bread.\u000A\u000A3) Heat up a panini press, or, if you\u0027re like 99 to 100 percent of reasonable Americans and didn\u0027t spend money on a panini press, heat one tablespoon of butter over medium heat in a heavy-bottomed pan. For my makeshift sandwich press, I heat up a fat cast-iron Dutch oven, butter the bottom, then smash it on top of the sandwich to compress it down and cook it at the same time. If that fails, just use your bare man-hands and start punching at the sandwich until the cheese is melted.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A4) Eat it, probably.",

you&apos;re probably wondering. <em>Paninis had their own month</em>? Indeed, says Josh Scherer, the 23-year-old guy behind the meat-packed monstrosity pictured above. &quot;Because if made-up food holidays are no longer sacred, what is?&quot; As the voice behind the uproarious <a href="http://culinarybrodown.com">food blog</a> <a href="https://instagram.com/culinarybrodown/?hl=en">Culinary Brodown</a>, Scherer has something of a unique worldview that refracts deep-fried bro gluttony through a thoughtful, academic lens. And that sort of brand dissonance has served him well: Those 41.5k Instagram fans didn&apos;t come out of nowhere. (He admits he even wants to build a Pinterest following.) While the LA-based food writer may don the occasional neon tank top, his hands-on cooking experience and food essays for <a href="http://www.maxim.com/authors/josh-scherer">Maxim</a> and <a href="http://www.lamag.com/author/joshscherer/">Los Angeles Magazine</a> seem to indicate there&apos;s lot more on his mind than beef and beer. One thing is clear: He ain&apos;t just the next Guy Fieri.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>So the name. Let&apos;s talk about the name. Where did the name come from?</strong><br>This sounds too good to be true, but it was made up by a drunk stranger at a party. I was kicking around ideas with a roommate during my first year at UCLA, and I told him, &quot;I want to start a food blog and play off the idea of &quot;bro food&quot; because that&apos;d be a hilarious caricature to write from&#x2014;something that&apos;s authentic but also rooted in creativity.  We tried throwing out bro food puns and couldn&apos;t think of any. This drunk stranger, who I only know as &quot;the guy my Italian roommate would play basketball and smoke pot with sometimes,&quot; is laying stoned on the couch and he&apos;s like, &quot;Culinary Brodown!&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, I can work with that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Your foodie bonafides seem to check out. It seems you&apos;ve read Tom Colicchio&apos;s </strong><strong> Think Like a Chef, </strong><strong> interned at an LA gastropub called Plan Check, and studied with celebrity cook Kris Morningstar, right?</strong><br>Studied is a heavy word for what Kris and I did. We cooked a lot, drank a lot of champagne in alleys, and ate foie gras while it was still illegal.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>How did you meet him?</strong><br>An LA studio was testing out a reality television show concept of food bloggers challenging actual chefs. It was meant to shame bloggers. Like, &quot;Look how much of an asshole you are, criticizing someone else&apos;s food when you can&apos;t even cook.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.7">Morningstar tends to not like people from culinary school. His sous chef right now used to be a fullback at UCLA and most of his other staff members are former athletes. <em>[Scherer was on the track &amp; field team in college]</em> He was like, &quot;You really fit the bill, if you want to come cook at this pop up with me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.8">He offered me a position in his kitchen, but then I got a full time job as an editor. It&apos;s easier to sit in a desk and criticize food than to actually make food, which I guess would be proving the point of that TV show&#x2026;</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>I found a <a href="https://instagram.com/p/sd5VwdTMPe/?taken-by=culinarybrodown">picture</a> online of you and Guy Fieri. What&apos;s the story? Is he really one of your heroes?</strong><br>He&apos;s the hero and anti-hero at the same time. Everything you see on TV is a caricature, but chefs will attest that he&apos;s actually a hell of a cook. He&apos;s just found a niche where he can exploit for the most amount of money and give himself the biggest platform. The question I always wrestle with is, &quot;Would I not do the same if I were in his shoes?&quot; That&apos;s always drawn me to him in a weird way.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.a">So, a year ago three friends and I drove up to Santa Rosa to visit three of his restaurants in one night. We got full meals at each one and got hammered drunk. The food is absolutely terrible, but all of his cocktails are in fishbowls for $20. When we got to the third restaurant, it was rented out for Guy &apos;s son&apos;s birthday. I went to the bouncer and was like, &quot;Hey, man. We drove 1,000 miles to get here blah blah blah.&quot; He went and got a bigger bouncer and then he got the General Manager. Eventually Guy Fieri came out, and he just goes, &quot;Hey, who the fuck is trying to take a picture of me?&quot; We&apos;re like, &quot;Whoa. What? What?&quot; He&apos;s like, &quot;I&apos;m just kidding, bros!&apos; Then he hugs all of us and invites us inside and we have drinks and chicken wings.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>According to the early days of your blog, your &quot;culinary worldview&quot; was shaped by &quot;drinking on a lawn, cooking for friends, and watching food network while intoxicated?&quot; That changed much?</strong><br>No, not at all. I was on a food-centric trip to Israel last week, and the first day we were there I was asking our tour guide, &quot;Hey, what are the McDonald&apos;s like? Do they source from a higher quality place? What kind of energy drinks do Israelis drink considering their big club culture?&quot; Later on, he stopped me and said, &quot;I think I figured it out, man. You&apos;re just interested in smut. You just want to know all the smut food that people eat.&quot; I have a really earnest, almost academic, interest in the idea of bad food and people eating things that are terrible for them.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Ergo, the way of the</strong> <strong>&quot;Bro.&quot; This term is usually a pejorative for oblivious meatheads. But you seem pretty self-aware.</strong>    <br>I definitely wouldn&apos;t call myself a bro in the least. I&apos;m an anti-bro in a lot of ways. But, I&apos;m big, I wear backwards hats sometimes, and I hang out with a lot of other men. It was a label that was put on me. I think when you stereotype people, they work to live up to those. I figured I might as well own it and have an outlet to take my own direction and spin on it.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Do you actually use a Smirnoff bottle for a rolling pin, or is that just a metaphor?</strong><br>I used to, but now I live with my girlfriend who has fancy baking equipment. But it&apos;s funny, I was making a recipe this past weekend for some, like, Pop-Tart deal. I was rolling out puff pastry and I grabbed an empty wine bottle. She was like, &quot;What are you doing? We have a really nice rolling pin.&quot; I was like, &quot;That&apos;s too heavy. It&apos;ll crush the pastry,&quot; and I insisted on using this empty wine bottle.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>A wine bottle still feels like an upgrade! The food blog was created to get you a job, right? That worked. What&apos;s next?</strong><br>I have a good literary agent and I do want to write a book based off the blog, expand that whole natty-light fueled culinary thesis.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>During your extensive research for said thesis, what have you noticed that&apos;s wrong with the foodie scene right now?</strong><br>Shitty food bloggers. Everyone has the same opinions and everyone writes the same way. A girl I went to Israel with wrote an Instagram caption about hummus: &quot;I can&apos;t believe that this one dish has the power to unite an entire nation. Ground chickpeas and tahini are the keys to unity.&quot; I&apos;m like, &quot;Yeah? You wanna bring a fucking bowl of hummus into Gaza and see what happens?&quot; No, not all food is a metaphor. Not all food brings people together. It&apos;s romanticized in a shitty way that&apos;s actually destructive to the way people think.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>So how is Culinay Brodown trying to do right by the world?</strong><br>I started thinking about what I want to be known for. Shock food or stunt food, the idea of mashing things together and throwing them out to the Internet, blew up pretty recently. People are rolling shit in bacon and peanut butter and deep-frying it, even if it doesn&apos;t make any sense. It seems like the craft in it is dead. I&apos;m trying to be clever and crafty with it. Someone sees a ridiculous name like &quot;Culinary Brodown,&quot; but then they see some ostentatious cheeseburger staring them in the face. They realize, &quot;Holy shit. Did he make a Charred Leek Velout&#xE9;? What the hell is happening?&quot; I think I&apos;m setting my food up in a way that defies people&apos;s expectations.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>You never just wanna make food? Your food has to <em>&quot;say something?</em>&quot;</strong><br>I don&apos;t think I could make food for the sake of food if I tried. It feels unnatural to say I made this taco because I wanted to put it in my mouth.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>But in order to appear on Culinary Brodown, does a recipe</strong>  <strong>have</strong>  <strong>to be an artery-choker? Is the health factor ever a consideration for you?</strong> <br>I&apos;ve been relatively fat my entire life. But to be a shot put thrower, you had to be, so that was my crutch while making these crazy recipes. Now that I&apos;m sitting at a desk all day, I have to eat really clean in general. It&apos;s got me thinking about things in a new way. I don&apos;t think I can make a recipe that is terrible for people and morally justify it. Even if I&apos;m opening a conversation, I&apos;m still forwarding a broken system and doing it willingly. But, I also worry that I&apos;m in the wrong. On one hand, I&apos;m really fascinated with fast food. I love writing about it. I love eating it. Yet, I also understand how terrible it is for the world at large, health-wise, global-wise. It&apos;s meal colonialism.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>Sounds like you&apos;re wrestling with some pretty heavy cognitive dissonance.</strong><br>[<em>Laughs</em>] Yeah, if you can&apos;t see the self-loathing in my recipes, you&apos;re not looking hard enough. Maybe that&apos;s my brand in a nutshell: Actively acting against my self interest&#x2026;with bacon!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>How did you come up with our Manini recipe?</strong><br>You just think of things that you would want to eat. Many of these ideas are pre-formed, floating around in my head. On a Wednesday evening, I couldn&apos;t just be like, &quot;I&apos;m going to cook a schnitzel and bratwurst and multiple cheese sandwich and eat that casually.&quot; But if it&apos;s like, &quot;Hey, I&apos;m doing this because this is my job apparently,&quot; it gives me an excuse.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>What about this sandwich distinguishes it as a &quot;Man-ini&quot; and separates it from all other paninis?</strong><br>It&apos;s beautifully grotesque, in the fact that there are multiple preparations of meat of the same animal that are stacked on top of each other. You have grounded up pig on top of pounded out pig. It&apos;s all deep fried, and one of them is cooked in beer. That&apos;s kind of the definition of Main-ini, in a way.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.m"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55e3053cf83274863bb01ad0/master/w_806/Manini6-2.jpg" alt="Manini6-2.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fall-hail-the-manini&amp;t=Manini6-2.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fall-hail-the-manini&amp;t=Manini6-2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fall-hail-the-manini&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55e3053cf83274863bb01ad0%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FManini6-2.jpg&amp;description=Manini6-2.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fall-hail-the-manini&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55e3053cf83274863bb01ad0%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FManini6-2.jpg&amp;description=Manini6-2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>Photos courtesy of Josh Scherer</p></span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.n"><h2><strong>The Fat Kraut (a.k.a.

That&#x2019;s called butterflying. Wrap the chop in plastic wrap, then use a tenderizing mallet&#x2014;or a wine bottle&#x2014;to pound the meat out flat. Season with salt and pepper.</p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.r">2) Set out three separate bowls. In one, add the flour; in another, add the egg; and in the third, toss in the breadcrumbs, paprika, sesame seeds, and 1 tsp. black pepper. Season each bowl with salt. </p><p data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.s">3) Heat &#xBD; inch of canola oil on medium-high in a heavy-bottomed pan, preferably cast iron. When the oil is shimmering and moving freely, add your pig cutlet.

For my makeshift sandwich press, I heat up a fat cast-iron Dutch oven, butter the bottom, then smash it on top of the sandwich to compress it down and cook it at the same time. If that fails, just use your bare man-hands and start punching at the sandwich until the cheese is melted.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".14oejw15vk0.1.1.0.0.4.14"><figure
