Chris Pratt, less so. Here are five vivid snapshots from the early years of a man who always felt pretty sure, even when he had few sensible grounds to think this way, that everything would turn out all right. \u000A\u000A1. Hawaii\u000A\u000AThe story of how Chris Pratt first became an actor is an absurd and unlikely one. He had done some acting in high school and some plays afterward, but by the time he was 19 he had burnt out as a door-to-door salesman and moved to Hawaii to live with a friend in a van with a painting of Scooby Doo and Shaggy on its side. Though he remembers telling the parents of a girl he was dating there that he really wanted to be an actor\u0022they were probably like \u0027Oh god, our daughter is dating a kid who lives in a van who thinks he wants to be an actor\u0027\u0022he wasn\u0027t doing anything at all about it. For money, he worked as a waiter at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. But, for some reason, he believed.\u000A\u000A\u0022I was always destined to do it,\u0022 he says now, \u0022and I just believed that somehow the opportunity would present itself.\u0022\u000A\u000AGiven that he was in Hawaii, a place with no obvious opportunities for a wannabe actor, this was a particularly ludicrous expectation. But, improbably, he was right. One day the actress Rae Dawn Chong came in to the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. for a meal. Pratt says that the moment he spotted her he immediately saw this as an opportunity: \u0022I was \u0027that\u0027s a movie starshe might be my in to Hollywood\u0027.\u0022 So he went up to her table. \u0022I was like, \u0027Hey, you\u0027re a movie star, what are you doing here?\u0027\u0022 Within seconds, he says, an opening appeared: \u0022She said, \u0027You\u0027re cute, you act?\u0027 I was like, \u0027Fuck yeah, put me in your movie!\u0027.\u0022\u000A\u000ABy the most unlikely of chances, there really was a movie to put him in. Although Chong was on vacation, she had also been hunting for a good-looking young man to play the male lead in a horror spoof movie she was about to direct. \u0022When I walked in the restaurant I actually felt someone staring at me,\u0022 she recalls. \u0022You know that Spidey sense we all have? And I saw someone making a beelineI Just thought it was a really eager waiter. My first impression was \u0027he looks like a blond young Matt Dillon\u0027. I said to him, \u0027can you act?\u0027 and he proceeded to list a bunch of high school things that he\u0027d done.\u0022 But she was instantly struck by something about him. \u0022They can be handsome, they can be breathtakingly beautiful, but not everybody really has the thingit\u0027s not just charisma, it\u0027s an extra layer, a quality of being where you know that person is a star. I don\u0027t know how, but that second that I met him I knew this kid was extremely talented.\u0022\u000A\u000AChong asked for his number. He didn\u0027t have one, so he gave her his friend Mike\u0027s. That nearly blew it. \u0022A couple days later,\u0022 Pratt remembers, \u0022he\u0027s, like, \u0027Oh, by the way, someone called\u0027. I was, like, \u0027What the fuck? No way!\u0027 And then I called her back, she\u0027s like, \u0027Hey kid, just so you know I\u0027m serious about this and you should answer your phone and get back to me about this\u0027.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I might have done that,\u0022 says Chong. \u0022I don\u0027t like it when people don\u0027t keep their word. Especially young people.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I drove there that day,\u0022 Pratt continues, \u0022picked up a script, went back to Mike\u0027s house, read the script three times in a row. It was the first time I\u0027d ever read a 120-page script. I\u0027m, like, \u0027My character\u0027s name is gonna be Devon! Sweet! I could totally play a Devon!\u0027 And I went to the audition, knew exactly how I was gonna do the readingI\u0027d taken a pencil and figured out all the inflectionsgave a great audition, and she was like \u0027Yeah, you can act, I\u0027m gonna use you\u0027. I was like, \u0027Damn, alright, sweet\u0027. And I said, \u0027Does it shoot here on the island?\u0027 She said, \u0027No, it shoots in LA\u0027. I was like, \u0027Fuck, I can\u0027t afford to go to LAI think I have $60 and a bag full of shit including my roller blades and that\u0027s, like, what I own\u0027. She said, \u0027Sweetie, we\u0027ll fly you there\u0027. And it was in that moment I was, like, \u0027My life has just changed forever...I\u0027m an actor...I\u0027m gonna be an actor\u0027. I knew it.\u0022\u000A\u000AAfter the audition, he remembers that they went for a swim in the ocean. \u0022I was just staring at her,\u0022 he says. \u0022I remember thinking to myself \u0027this is it\u0027.\u0022 He told his friends the news, and they banded together to give him $350 and a lei in a box\u0022this nice box that I still have\u0022as a farewell gift. Some of his friends told him \u0022if anyone can do this, it\u0027s you\u0022; others were \u0022we\u0027ll see you in a couple of months.\u0022 The doubters were the ones who were proved wrong; Pratt never returnednot until much later, anyway, and only for a vacation.\u000A\u000AIn Los Angeles, he fell on his feet.\u000A\u000A\u0022We called him The Kid, The Boy,\u0022 Chong remembers, \u0022and we all looked after him. All my friends made sure that he didn\u0027t suffer. Everybody loved him.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe movie they made, Cursed Part 3, wasn\u0027t so good, and when he brought his girlfriend and his friends to a screening he remembers that they all fell asleep. But Pratt only saw the possibilities:\u000A\u000A\u0022I knew the movie was bad but it didn\u0027t matter. All I needed was footage from my scenes so that I could use it to get a manager and an agent. I was just always hyper-focused on the next step...I was pretty delusional and young. Luckily.\u0022\u000A\u000A2. Los Angeles (Nudity)\u000A\u000APratt is driving me around Los Angeles in his wife\u0027s car, a black Audi S7, on a sunny March afternoon when he abruptly pulls into a side street.\u000A\u000A \u0022Want to see an apartment I used to live in?\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A We pause on a corner, and he points to the second proper home he had in Los Angeles. \u0022The lady who lived in the apartment\u0027s name was Halo,\u0022 he says. \u0022I essentially rented out the walk-in closet for a few hundred bucks a month.\u0022 He gestures toward the fire escape. \u0022I used to jump up and climb it all the time.\u0022\u000A\u000A I ask him what it was like, living there.\u000A\u000A \u0022It was awesome. We had the time of our lives, we were having so much fun. Really a lot of nudity. Halo liked to always be naked, and she was a painter, was very bohemian. We were just friends. It was just past 9/11. That was a really fun time of my life. A lot of art and music and free love and all that kind of stuff. It was pretty cool.\u0022 He pulls away. \u0022That\u0027s crazy. I haven\u0027t even thought about that place for a long time.\u0022\u000A\u000A3. Playing Dumb.\u000A\u000AIf Chris Pratt\u0027s risesomehow both steady and spectacularcaught people by surprise, it may partly be because of a tactic he learned to adopt early in his career, one that he has been relying on to give him the element of surprise ever since.\u000A\u000A\u0022I was pretty good at lowering people\u0027s expectations,\u0022 he says, \u0022by this \u0027aw shucks\u0027 dummy attitude. It was total survival mechanism in life. From an early age. That I really honed when I became a door-to-door salesman. This naive kind of... the guy who was like too adorable to say no to. It was my persona as a young standup comedian. So I developed my winning formula: the slightly dimwitted but charming guy. Immediately you\u0027d let down your defenses because you\u0027re, like, \u0027Oh, what\u0027s the worst that could happen with this young little dummy?\u0027, you know what I mean? And that led to some roles.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn the era when you were having a lot of success playing kind of dumb and naive, did you find it crossed over and that people would assume that was the real you?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. Loved that. Because I think the greatest offense you can have is to trick someone into underestimating you. It\u0027s like the little catfish who has like a toe that looks like a worm, you know? \u0027Come here\u0027.\u0022\u000A\u000APratt mimes the catfish jubilantly chomping on its deceived prey.\u000A\u000A\u0022Deep down inside I\u0027ve always been a survivor. I\u0027m probably revealing too much but who gives a shit?\u0022\u000A\u000A4. Los Angeles (Auditions)\u000A\u000AChris Pratt can remember the first time he nearly got a serious movie role, another key moment in reasserting his belief that he could, and would, do this. The film would end up being a Bruce Willis vehicle called Tears Of The Sun, though Willis was not yet involved at this stage. Pratt was up for the role of a man who would walk ahead of the rest of the military group. \u0022It was one of my first auditions, and I was so earnest and hungry at the time,\u0022 he says. He readied himself for it with extreme earnest: \u0022I was in character for three days, walking the hills in my army fatigues. I didn\u0027t shower.\u0022\u000A\u000A Actors in competition with each other are not always supportive of their peers, and in the room outside the audition, another of the auditioners took Pratt to task for this over-preparation. \u0022He tried to big-time me,\u0022 Pratt remembers, \u0022because I was pretty much dressed like the character and he was wearing like some designer jeans and a cool t-shirt. And he just looked at me like \u0027Really, bro? You know this is an audition? You don\u0027t have to wear the fucking costume to the audition. New guy...\u0027\u0022\u000A\u000APratt was unbowed.\u000A\u000A\u0022I went in there, I was all intense. They were \u0027Do you have any questions?\u0027 and I just started grabbing the furniture and flipping it over and building little barricades and stuff like that. I took that shit so seriously. It was awesome.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat made so much difference to him, going forward, was that the movie\u0027s director actually seemed responsive to what he was doing.\u000A\u000A\u0022He took me seriously,\u0022 says Pratt. \u0022He didn\u0027t kind of laugh me off because I was so earnest and green.\u0022\u000A\u000APratt was even called back for a second audition. They ultimately cast another actor (though not, thank goodness, the condescending one in designer jeans). But according to Pratt \u0022just the fact that I got a callback felt like a victory\u0022one that he fed on as he pressed forward.\u000A\u000AAnd sometimes, even if it\u0027s not until many years later, circles such as these eventually close. The movie Chris Pratt is making in the spring of 2015 is a reimagining of The Magnificent Seven. Pratt jumped at it for a number of reasons. \u0022Westerns are one of my favorite genres,\u0022 he says. \u0022I always wanted to learn to ride a horse and shoot, shoot single-action revolvers. To be a gunslinger, to be out in the desert.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut it also made a difference that the director, Antoine Fuqua, was also that same director who watched a young smelly man in army fatigues build barricades out of furniture all those years ago, and did nothing to make him feel that what he was doing was not worthwhile.\u000A\u000A5. Sixth grade.\u000A\u000AI talk to Chris Pratt at some length about just how preposterous and unlikely the story of his discovery is. He can\u0027t really feel it, of course, because for him it not only did happen, but he somehow always felt that it would.\u000A\u000ABut you could have waited fifty years for that to happen.\u000A\u000A\u0022I think I\u0027d be OK with it, because Hawaii\u0027s pretty fucking awesome.\u0022\u000A\u000ADo you think you\u0027d have found a different way?\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s a hypothetical that I\u0027ll never have to answer. Maybe if we have a complete misunderstanding of space and each star is actually this galaxy, just a different version of it, there\u0027s probably somewhere I\u0027m still a waiter in Hawaii. But there are probably a lot more where I\u0027m doing this and it was just a different way that took me in this town. This town went on a hunt to find me.\u0022\u000A\u000APratt doesn\u0027t say things like thisthis town went on a hunt to find mefor laughs, but quite sincerely, as though he is patiently explaining to me reality as it has appeared to him. And, anyway, he will also suggest to me that he had sufficient grounds to believe that his optimism was justified, and that the universe had already indicated to him quite clearly enough that Hollywood stardom was to be his birthright and that all he needed to do was to claim it.\u000A\u000A\u0022I won outstanding actor of the year,\u0022 he points out, \u0022in sixth grade.\u0022",

data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.2"><em>Most actors have tales of the grim, seemingly endless struggles they faced before they eventually made it. Chris Pratt, less so. Here are five vivid snapshots from the early years of a man who always felt pretty sure, even when he had few sensible grounds to think this way, that everything would turn out all right. </em></p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>1. Hawaii</strong></p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.5">The story of how Chris Pratt first became an actor is an absurd and unlikely one. He had done some acting in high school and some plays afterward, but by the time he was 19 he had burnt out as a door-to-door salesman and moved to Hawaii to live with a friend in a van with a painting of Scooby Doo and Shaggy on its side. Though he remembers telling the parents of a girl he was dating there that he really wanted to be an actor&quot;they were probably like &#x2019;Oh god, our daughter is dating a kid who lives in a van who thinks he wants to be an actor&#x2019;&quot;he wasn&#x2019;t doing anything at all about it. For money, he worked as a waiter at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. But, for some reason, he believed.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.6">&quot;I was always destined to do it,&quot; he says now, &quot;and I just believed that somehow the opportunity would present itself.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.7">Given that he was in Hawaii, a place with no obvious opportunities for a wannabe actor, this was a particularly ludicrous expectation. But, improbably, he was right. One day the actress Rae Dawn Chong came in to the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. for a meal. Pratt says that the moment he spotted her he immediately saw this as an opportunity: &quot;I was &#x2019;that&#x2019;s a movie starshe might be my in to Hollywood&#x2019;.&quot; So he went up to her table. &quot;I was like, &#x2019;Hey, you&#x2019;re a movie star, what are you doing here?&#x2019;&quot; Within seconds, he says, an opening appeared: &quot;She said, &#x2019;You&#x2019;re cute, you act?&#x2019; I was like, &#x2019;Fuck yeah, put me in your movie!&#x2019;.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.8">By the most unlikely of chances, there really was a movie to put him in. Although Chong was on vacation, she had also been hunting for a good-looking young man to play the male lead in a horror spoof movie she was about to direct. &quot;When I walked in the restaurant I actually felt someone staring at me,&quot; she recalls. &quot;You know that Spidey sense we all have? And I saw someone making a beelineI Just thought it was a really eager waiter. My first impression was &#x2019;he looks like a blond young Matt Dillon&#x2019;. I said to him, &#x2019;can you act?&#x2019; and he proceeded to list a bunch of high school things that he&#x2019;d done.&quot; But she was instantly struck by something about him. &quot;They can be handsome, they can be breathtakingly beautiful, but not everybody really has the thingit&#x2019;s not just charisma, it&#x2019;s an extra layer, a quality of being where you know that person is a star. I don&#x2019;t know how, but that second that I met him I knew this kid was extremely talented.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.9">Chong asked for his number. He didn&#x2019;t have one, so he gave her his friend Mike&#x2019;s. That nearly blew it. &quot;A couple days later,&quot; Pratt remembers, &quot;he&#x2019;s, like, &#x2019;Oh, by the way, someone called&#x2019;. I was, like, &#x2019;What the fuck? No way!&#x2019; And then I called her back, she&#x2019;s like, &#x2019;Hey kid, just so you know I&#x2019;m serious about this and you should answer your phone and get back to me about this&#x2019;.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.a">&quot;I might have done that,&quot; says Chong. &quot;I don&#x2019;t like it when people don&#x2019;t keep their word. Especially young people.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.b">&quot;I drove there that day,&quot; Pratt continues, &quot;picked up a script, went back to Mike&#x2019;s house, read the script three times in a row. It was the first time I&#x2019;d ever read a 120-page script. I&#x2019;m, like, &#x2019;My character&#x2019;s name is gonna be Devon! Sweet! I could totally play a Devon!&#x2019; And I went to the audition, knew exactly how I was gonna do the readingI&#x2019;d taken a pencil and figured out all the inflectionsgave a great audition, and she was like &#x2019;Yeah, you can act, I&#x2019;m gonna use you&#x2019;. I was like, &#x2019;Damn, alright, sweet&#x2019;. And I said, &#x2019;Does it shoot here on the island?&#x2019; She said, &#x2019;No, it shoots in LA&#x2019;. I was like, &#x2019;Fuck, I can&#x2019;t afford to go to LAI think I have $60 and a bag full of shit including my roller blades and that&#x2019;s, like, what I own&#x2019;. She said, &#x2019;Sweetie, we&#x2019;ll fly you there&#x2019;. And it was in that moment I was, like, &#x2019;My life has just changed forever...I&#x2019;m an actor...I&#x2019;m gonna be an actor&#x2019;. I knew it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.c">After the audition, he remembers that they went for a swim in the ocean. &quot;I was just staring at her,&quot; he says. &quot;I remember thinking to myself &#x2019;this is it&#x2019;.&quot; He told his friends the news, and they banded together to give him $350 and a lei in a box&quot;this nice box that I still have&quot;as a farewell gift. Some of his friends told him &quot;if anyone can do this, it&#x2019;s you&quot;; others were &quot;we&#x2019;ll see you in a couple of months.&quot; The doubters were the ones who were proved wrong; Pratt never returnednot until much later, anyway, and only for a vacation.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.d">In Los Angeles, he fell on his feet.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.e">&quot;We called him The Kid, The Boy,&quot; Chong remembers, &quot;and we all looked after him. All my friends made sure that he didn&#x2019;t suffer. Everybody loved him.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.f">The movie they made, <em>Cursed Part 3</em>, wasn&#x2019;t so good, and when he brought his girlfriend and his friends to a screening he remembers that they all fell asleep. But Pratt only saw the possibilities:</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.g">&quot;I knew the movie was bad but it didn&#x2019;t matter. All I needed was footage from my scenes so that I could use it to get a manager and an agent. I was just always hyper-focused on the next step...I was pretty delusional and young. Luckily.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>2. Los Angeles (Nudity)</strong></p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.i">Pratt is driving me around Los Angeles in his wife&#x2019;s car, a black Audi S7, on a sunny March afternoon when he abruptly pulls into a side street.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.j"> &quot;Want to see an apartment I used to live in?&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.k"> We pause on a corner, and he points to the second proper home he had in Los Angeles. &quot;The lady who lived in the apartment&#x2019;s name was Halo,&quot; he says. &quot;I essentially rented out the walk-in closet for a few hundred bucks a month.&quot; He gestures toward the fire escape. &quot;I used to jump up and climb it all the time.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.l"> I ask him what it was like, living there.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.m"> &quot;It was awesome. We had the time of our lives, we were having so much fun. Really a lot of nudity. Halo liked to always be naked, and she was a painter, was very bohemian. We were just friends. It was just past 9/11. That was a really fun time of my life. A lot of art and music and free love and all that kind of stuff. It was pretty cool.&quot; He pulls away. &quot;That&#x2019;s crazy. I haven&#x2019;t even thought about that place for a long time.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>3. Playing Dumb.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.o">If Chris Pratt&#x2019;s risesomehow both steady and spectacularcaught people by surprise, it may partly be because of a tactic he learned to adopt early in his career, one that he has been relying on to give him the element of surprise ever since.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.p">&quot;I was pretty good at lowering people&#x2019;s expectations,&quot; he says, &quot;by this &#x2019;aw shucks&#x2019; dummy attitude. It was total survival mechanism in life. From an early age. That I really honed when I became a door-to-door salesman. This naive kind of... the guy who was like too adorable to say no to. It was my persona as a young standup comedian. So I developed my winning formula: the slightly dimwitted but charming guy. Immediately you&#x2019;d let down your defenses because you&#x2019;re, like, &#x2019;Oh, what&#x2019;s the worst that could happen with this young little dummy?&#x2019;, you know what I mean? And that led to some roles.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.q"><em>In the era when you were having a lot of success playing kind of dumb and naive, did you find it crossed over and that people would assume that was the real you?</em></p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.r">&quot;Yeah. Loved that. Because I think the greatest offense you can have is to trick someone into underestimating you. It&#x2019;s like the little catfish who has like a toe that looks like a worm, you know? &#x2019;Come here&#x2019;.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.s">Pratt mimes the catfish jubilantly chomping on its deceived prey.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.t">&quot;Deep down inside I&#x2019;ve always been a survivor. I&#x2019;m probably revealing too much but who gives a shit?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong>4. Los Angeles (Auditions)</strong></p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.v">Chris Pratt can remember the first time he nearly got a serious movie role, another key moment in reasserting his belief that he could, and would, do this. The film would end up being a Bruce Willis vehicle called <em>Tears Of The Sun</em>, though Willis was not yet involved at this stage. Pratt was up for the role of a man who would walk ahead of the rest of the military group. &quot;It was one of my first auditions, and I was so earnest and hungry at the time,&quot; he says. He readied himself for it with extreme earnest: &quot;I was in character for three days, walking the hills in my army fatigues. I didn&#x2019;t shower.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.w"> Actors in competition with each other are not always supportive of their peers, and in the room outside the audition, another of the auditioners took Pratt to task for this over-preparation. &quot;He tried to big-time me,&quot; Pratt remembers, &quot;because I was pretty much dressed like the character and he was wearing like some designer jeans and a cool t-shirt. And he just looked at me like &#x2019;Really, bro? You know this is an audition? You don&#x2019;t have to wear the fucking costume to the audition. New guy...&#x2019;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.x">Pratt was unbowed.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.y">&quot;I went in there, I was all intense. They were &#x2019;Do you have any questions?&#x2019; and I just started grabbing the furniture and flipping it over and building little barricades and stuff like that. I took that shit so seriously. It was awesome.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.z">What made so much difference to him, going forward, was that the movie&#x2019;s director actually seemed responsive to what he was doing.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.10">&quot;He took me seriously,&quot; says Pratt. &quot;He didn&#x2019;t kind of laugh me off because I was so earnest and green.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.11">Pratt was even called back for a second audition. They ultimately cast another actor (though not, thank goodness, the condescending one in designer jeans). But according to Pratt &quot;just the fact that I got a callback felt like a victory&quot;one that he fed on as he pressed forward.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.12">And sometimes, even if it&#x2019;s not until many years later, circles such as these eventually close. The movie Chris Pratt is making in the spring of 2015 is a reimagining of <em>The Magnificent Seven</em>. Pratt jumped at it for a number of reasons. &quot;Westerns are one of my favorite genres,&quot; he says. &quot;I always wanted to learn to ride a horse and shoot, shoot single-action revolvers. To be a gunslinger, to be out in the desert.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.13">But it also made a difference that the director, Antoine Fuqua, was also that same director who watched a young smelly man in army fatigues build barricades out of furniture all those years ago, and did nothing to make him feel that what he was doing was not worthwhile.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.14"><strong>5. Sixth grade.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.15">I talk to Chris Pratt at some length about just how preposterous and unlikely the story of his discovery is. He can&#x2019;t really feel it, of course, because for him it not only did happen, but he somehow always felt that it would.</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.16"><em>But you could have waited fifty years for that to happen.</em></p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.17">&quot;I think I&#x2019;d be OK with it, because Hawaii&#x2019;s pretty fucking awesome.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.18"><em>Do you think you&#x2019;d have found a different way?</em></p><p data-reactid=".17rrs5155hc.1.1.0.0.4.19">&quot;That&#x2019;s a hypothetical that I&#x2019;ll never have to answer. Maybe if we have a complete misunderstanding of space and each star is actually this galaxy, just a different version of it, there&#x2019;s probably somewhere I&#x2019;m still a waiter in Hawaii. But there are probably a lot more where I&#x2019;m doing this and it was just a different way that took me in this town.
