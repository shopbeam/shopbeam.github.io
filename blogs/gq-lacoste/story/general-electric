  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe general is en route as a sequined Elvis impersonator struts and sings onstage. The crowd at the music festival in El Dorado, Arkansas, swallows funnel cake, pigtail taters, cherry limeade, turkey legs and piles of barbecue. One side of the town square has become a parking lot for the Christian Motorcyclists Association, and the holy mamas parade by in their righteous leathers. On the other side are banks of stalls peddling T-shirts, most of which boast the Confederate flag, the faces of dead rebels or the admonition that these colors never run. For the general, an Arkansas boy, this is home.\u000A\u000AThere is a dim sense in the happy crowd that he is coming, a beribboned boy with a Silver Star, a Purple Heart and the right accent. The general is the only Democrat running who can walk into a square like this, cut right through the smoke rising off the brisket, amble past the come-to-Jesus faces, the Jack Daniel\u0027s vitamin regimen, and be a homeboy. In a blue-and-red nation, he\u0027s the hope, the man who can cross the new color line and, by that act, decide the next election.\u000A\u000AClark, hair trimmed, body a tight mass of muscle—he\u0027s hardly gained a pound since West Point—stands with his wife backstage. He\u0027s wrapped in a light blue pinstriped shirt, gold tie, olive slacks, brown shoes. She\u0027s a good-looking woman with a raft of blond hair, wearing a harvest gold blazer, gold earrings and a gold necklace. And then it\u0027s time, and he\u0027s out front alone, facing maybe more than 500 people, some holding placards his staff has just handed out like candy: WE LOVE WES; CLARK FOR PRESIDENT; THE GENERAL ELECTION; and EL DORADO LOVES CLARK.\u000A\u000AHe begins, \u0022Wal, howz ever\u0027one doin\u0027 this afternoon?\u0022 and then slides into English. He tells them he needs their help, and then he launches into his story. Two weeks into his campaign, and the bones of his tale are starting to fall into place—Little Rock boyhood, West Point, \u0022married a beautiful Yankee,\u0022 and then the dealmaker: \u0022I went to Vietnam, got shot.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe peddles his notions: Our country is \u0022unraveling\u0022; the world has stopped loving America; \u0022a great economy has fallen apart\u0022; the environment is being hit hard; poverty; health insurance…the entire normal set of worry beads fingered by liberal Democrats.\u000A\u000AThe crowd is polite but remains a dead calm of flesh.\u000A\u000AHe says he is proud of our troops in Iraq but \u0022trouble is, I think we are asking them to do the wrong thing,\u0022 and suddenly this becomes his first applause line. The general begins to look comfortable, and that big smile shines on his face.\u000A\u000AWe need to spend the money here, not waste it over there, the general says. We need jobs, and this administration has lost them. He attacks President Bush. He even rolls out his New Patriotism idea, saying, \u0022It is not wrong to disagree; that\u0027s the highest form of democracy.\u0022 This, too, gets applause.\u000A\u000AAt the end of maybe fifteen minutes, there is polite applause and fifty or a hundred people stand up. The general hasn\u0027t set the place on fire, but he has gotten them listening amid the pork smoke that fills the air.\u000A\u000AThe rope line forms to the right of the stage as the next act—winners of the amateur singing contest—belts out its songs. Clark, wife at side, no goon squad of security to protect him, listens and smiles at each handshake, handling each citizen like a priest in a confessional, having actual conversations rather than the customary grip-and-grab. He kisses babies, and each time the crowd surges in, cameras come out, and everyone watches carefully to see how he pulls off this traditional political task. He does just fine.\u000A\u000AAll the crowd sees is Ol\u0027 Wes, that Little Rock boy whose work took him away for a spell but who has come home now.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHe gets up at five or so each day and tries to get in 2,000 yards in the pool. (I\u0027ll save you the math: That\u0027s well over a mile.) Wherever he is, it takes 2,000 yards for Wes Clark to maintain. Lap after lap, the water wrapping his body, the world shut out, nothing but that line on the pool bottom and the strokes. He\u0027s been at it since boyhood, this swimming thing. If you want to know a little about who Wes Clark is, come down to the water.\u000A\u000ASwimming is not just ercise. Every stroke fights against resistance—water is not easy, like air—and the long-distance swimmer faces a tougher planet than that guy out on a run. And the water, thank God, feels warm and shuts over everything—all the noise and color and talk, shuts it out until there is nothing but that line, that blue, those strokes, the discipline of breathing, and the flip turn at the end of the lane as the next lap rolls up. Take away the black line on the pool bottom and you\u0027re back to the womb.\u000A\u000AThe general sits across the fine conference table on the seventh floor of the Ritz-Carlton in Phoenix. In a day, he will face down his competitors in a nationally televised forum of all the Democratic candidates. He\u0027s been living a blur of fund-raising phone calls—just under two weeks out of the chute, he has rustled up more than $3.5 million, he\u0027s bagged key Hollywood backers, and, why, the day before in Tulsa, several big checkbooks showed up at a get-together for him in a private home—and now he\u0027s running an hour late on his schedule. The general is not a man to be late. He sits with his shirt wrinkled—a damn rare thing, because he cannot abide sloppy dress. He turns on that 150-watt smile and shakes hands firmly. The general has the ability to feel as comfortable as an old shoe and, at the same time, freeze a person with the eyes of Judgment Day.\u000A\u000AI ask him if he\u0027s frazzled by the pace of the campaign, and he swats the question away as if it were a pesky fly.\u000A\u000A\u0022I was four years as a four-star,\u0022 he says crisply. \u0022I was in thirty-three countries in one twelve-month period. I traveled 250 to 260 days a year.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s iron discipline. In 1996, when the army sent him down to run Southern Command (all that ground from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego), he picked up Spanish like one of those little liquor bottles they have on airliners. He speaks Russian, knows economics stone-cold, and in his army days was considered one of their most gifted strategists. He\u0027s not a guy who is going to be daunted by any to-do list.\u000A\u000AThe general holds a reputation for being brilliant, for being brave (hell, when a vehicle full of negotiators went flying off the road during the Balkan war and fried the occupants to a crisp, Wes Clark immediately roped up and rappelled down through mined ground to see if they could be saved) and for always turning his units into crack outfits. And for not being very well liked. Twice the army tried to stop his career cold. This enmity stemmed from the army\u0027s traditional unease with highly educated warriors who ace West Point and then bag Rhodes scholarships because they might not be good commanders.\u000A\u000AHe was admired as a commander (when he ran one outfit in the late \u002780s, the officers under him were in awe, damn near died from the workload and privately called him POD, Prince of Darkness, for his exacting standards). He got practically every award and glowing report the military can give. Everything except an affectionate nickname. And when he won the first NATO war ever, he was summarily retired and humiliated. He\u0027d barely announced for president when his old boss, General Hugh Shelton, allowed as how he would never vote for Wes Clark, because of \u0022integrity and character issues.\u0022\u000A\u000A A Day in the Life\u000A\u000AYou think you\u0027re busy? Try running for president. Here\u0027s what a typical Tuesday in October looked like for Wesley Clark.\u000A\u000A8:15 A.M. Depart Comfort Inn en route to Coney\u0027s \u0027N\u0027 More Cafe [drive time: 10 minutes]\u000A\u000A8:25 A.M. Breakfast at Coney\u0027s \u0027N\u0027 More\u000A\u000A9:20 A.M. Open press\u000A\u000A9:30 A.M. Depart Coney\u0027s \u0027N\u0027 More Cafe en route to Fort Dodge Airport\u000A\u000A10:00 A.M. Wheels up, Fort Dodge to Tulsa, Oklahoma [flight time: 96 minutes]\u000A\u000A11:25 A.M. Wheels down, Tulsa, Oklahoma\u000A\u000A12:00 P.M. Lunch TBD\u000A\u000A2:50 P.M.

Wheels down, Phoenix\u000A\u000A8:40 P.M. Arrive at Ritz-Carlton, Phoenix\u000A\u000AClark has a smile that would melt ice, and there he is, flashing it now as I ask him about how he handles personal politics. He is state-of-the-art for making sure everyone in his command is taken care of—back in Little Rock, where dozens of people work twenty-four-seven to keep his campaign rolling, he walks through his headquarters every week and talks to each and every staffer, introduces himself to all the new people, asks what they need, how\u0027s it goin\u0027. That\u0027s it in a nutshell: the claim that an all-star general with a warm manner never seemed to become one of the boys.\u000A\u000ASo now I ask him just why Shelton bad-talked him. And suddenly the smile vanishes, the mouth becomes a hard line, the body stiffens, and Clark twirls both arms in the air. \u0022I don\u0027t know,\u0022 he says, clearly rankled. He\u0027s picking his words carefully. \u0022All I was doing was my duty.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe last time I\u0027d seen this look was on John McCain, and it came when I touched on the same ground, the turf a lot of Americans hardly seem to know, the one called personal honor. And when someone calls you on your integrity and character, well, that is a matter of personal honor. In the Balkan war, Clark headed a NATO that did not want to fight; faced down a genocidal dictator, Milosevic, whom he personally hated; fended off a Joint Chiefs and a Republican Congress that saw the place as a lose-lose situation dreamed up by the goddamn Clinton administration; and dealt with Defense Secretary William Cohen, who once sent an order to the general to \u0022get your fucking face off the TV,\u0022 this last because Clark was pushing for a deeper engagement in a war the administration and the army wanted off-camera and forgotten.\u000A\u000AHe pulled it all off by using television, by improvising, by playing politics and by doing the one thing he is really good at: refusing to lose. He won the war without losing a single American life. And they retired him early to humiliate him deliberately. Some of the top army brass did not even come to his retirement ceremony. And so it\u0027s damn hard not to believe that part of what fires General Clark\u0027s run for the job called commander in chief is this sudden and rude forced retirement dealt him by the army he gave his life to. He\u0027ll show them.\u000A\u000AAfter retiring, he went home to Little Rock, got on corporate boards, flew around the country giving speeches for twenty or thirty grand a crack, became the military expert on CNN. And this did not feel right. Because there is a part of Wes Clark that at first does not seem to quite fit. He\u0027s lived pretty well in the military—after all, when he ran NATO he had his own ch&amp;#xE2;teau and a fleet of planes to take him around. And he\u0027s connected to all the Little Rock money and lives in a nice house. But he doesn\u0027t seem to care much about money. Or the people who have it. He says things like, In the army a general gets maybe ten or twelve times what a grunt earns, and that seems to him about the right ratio. He says there is something wrong with CEOs getting 500 to 600 times what a working stiff makes.\u000A\u000AOut on the campaign trail, he talks of service and sacrifice. At times it sounds like the usual political crap, but then, at times, there is this edge. When he stood in the Transportation Workers Union hall in Tulsa, filled with American Airlines maintenance workers who had taken a pay cut to keep their corporation alive, Clark said to loud cheers, \u0022If you\u0027re giving up 10 percent of your pay, those ecutives should be giving up 30 percent or 40 percent of their pay.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd he\u0027s got one deep political talent; he can dance across America\u0027s great divide: race. A few days before, the general was the guest at Philander Smith College in Little Rock, a black Methodist school started after the Civil War to educate freed slaves. They ate him up. The blacks in the audience cheered him on, amened him, because they felt comfortable with him. He wasn\u0027t some white guy being polite; he was at ease with them and they knew it. They sensed a different color in the man.\u000A\u000AWhich is part of why Clark both attracts and frightens Democrats. He has only just registered in the party. He voted for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and has said kind words about both Bushes. He\u0027s a general trying to win the nomination of a party that shies away from military things. But when the Democratic Party goes south, heads into those places where funnel cake hits the spot and guns are natural (the general has about twenty himself), who can they roll out into all those courthouse squares who can get the votes?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAnd, my God, does he have plans—for jump-starting the economy, fixing education, dealing with Iraq—and they all seem to have three points, which he ticks off on three fingers. He\u0027s moving right now among the booths and tables of Coney\u0027s \u0027N\u0027 More Cafe, a ham-and-egger in Fort Dodge, Iowa, where the local business guys get together in the morning to talk and run the town. Every spot in rural America has such a joint.\u000A\u000AThe town itself has been dying for decades. When I ask one guy about local economic opportunities, he looks up and says, \u0022It ain\u0027t shit.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe general is working the tables, taking too long in his answers; he really seems to believe in answering questions rather than simply pressing the flesh. He is a born missionary, a man who almost glows when he repeats the army slogan \u0022Be all that you can be.\u0022 The crowd of Iowans is respectful but not easily won; presidential candidates descend here like locusts every four years. One table of veterans causes a brief dustup when one of them says the Dems are not supporting the troops in Iraq, and Clark will have none of it, not a bit. By God, whatever disagreements he may have with the administration over policy, the general does not leave the troops hanging. He\u0027s got those wounds.\u000A\u000AOver that cup of tea in Phoenix, he ticked them off for me. \u0022Got clipped—barummmph,\u0022 he notes of that bloody little patrol he was leading as a young officer in Vietnam. One in the hand, one in the leg, one in the shoulder and \u0022something that went through my butt.\u0022 He got the Silver Star for bravery and a Purple Heart. But the key is that he never surrendered command and he got his outfit through the firefight. And then spent a good year forcing his body back so he could run, forcing his hand back so he could shoot. Like a lot of men who have been in combat, he\u0027s not keen on war. A set point in the general\u0027s stump speech is his smacking one fist into the other and noting that using force is \u0022only, only, only a last resort.\u0022\u000A\u000AI ask him who his favorite general is, and he instantly says U. S. Grant. Clark has studied all the military heroes, and he has boiled greatness down to three key elements: \u0022vision, personal humility and the capacity to be present at the decisive point and work his magic at the decisive point.\u0022 Which leads to his late entry into the race, one the experts say is too late for him to raise enough money, too late to build an organization in the key primary states. The general dodges questions on this, talking, like a lifetime politician gifted with vacuous gab, about how \u0022I didn\u0027t make the decision until then,\u0022 meaning September. \u0022You can\u0027t decide to do this,\u0022 he continues, \u0022until you decide it\u0027s the right thing to do.\u0022\u000A\u000AMaybe, but he waited until the Iraq campaign plainly became the fuckup he\u0027d predicted in his speeches; he waited until it became clear that the other Democratic candidates were not setting the electorate on fire—none of them, not even Dr. Dean, who has created an astounding grassroots movement but still hasn\u0027t reached beyond the same demographics as Ben &amp; Jerry\u0027s ice cream. Clark waited until the president\u0027s numbers started sinking in the undertow of a bad economy, bad intelligence and a messy war.\u000A\u000AThere are people out there who would vote for a dog over Bush. And there are southerners and moderates and independents who feel uneasy about the deficit and the war but who do not like to criticize their president in wartime. And then this general from Arkansas shows up with a chest of medals and says, \u0022Our country is at risk, our country is in a crisis.… It\u0027s not wrong to ask questions; that\u0027s the highest form of democracy.… We want government that leads, not dictates.\u0022 And suddenly, there is a way to love the flag, support the troops, but speak up about things and still be patriotic. And the general wants to show them how.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s not big enough to be a general. He stands about five ten but looks shorter because he\u0027s so tightly muscled, a coiled force rather than some big beefy four-star guy. He moves with an athlete\u0027s grace, the body always centered, the step light. His hands are graceful also, almost delicate. His voice has that command force but is low-key and congenial. The smile flashes so often you want to swat it at times, but still, the general manages to put people at ease.\u000A\u000AEven at my ease, I still wonder: Who is this guy? What\u0027s written on the page after the résumé stops? We\u0027ve been plowing through the leadership stuff (George Washington, Abe Lincoln) and waltzing around about books (he likes Saul Bellow, John Updike), and we touched on his son, Wes Jr., who is a screenwriter in Los Angeles, not a military guy.\u000A\u000AThe general says, \u0022My son told me, \u0027I can\u0027t work normal hours. When I shave in the morning, it screws up my face. I\u0027m just going to have to be a writer.\u0027 \u0022 Which all sounds fine. Just as his wife, Gert, seems fine, tastefully dressed, smart, attractive—the natural complement for a general. He affectionately calls her \u0022the general\u0027s general\u0022 and credits her with one of his best applause lines: \u0022If conservatives were compassionate, why would you have to announce it by putting the word compassionate ahead of conservative?\u0022\u000A\u000AAfter you have been around Clark awhile, it all seems too perfect, too mannered, too friendly. Too programmed. In the end, we ask of candidates more than their résumés; we want to know about something that West Point and Oord do not give degrees in, a thing called character, a quality called fire, that spark of life that inspires trust and permits a nation of more than 290 million to have faith in some guy they have never had a beer with. Of course, for a lot of Democrats it is simply the fantasy of running a general and clobbering Republicans.\u000A\u000ABut I want more. I want to know where the hunger came from that propelled him to West Point, to rice paddies, to that fourth star, to mountains in the Balkans and now, with his pension assured and his country-club life in the bag, into strange towns to meet Christian bikers and kiss babies. I keep stumbling over one paragraph in Clark\u0027s book on the Balkan war that runs, \u0022I was born in Chicago. My father, Benjamin Kanne, was a lawyer and Democratic Party politician there.… My father died when I was not quite 4. My mother…returned to live with her parents in Arkansas and remarried a former banker.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat makes me stumble is that Clark says in his speeches that his mother worked as a bank secretary for forty bucks a week and that he knows what it\u0027s like not to have a lot of money. So as we sit in Phoenix and he sips his tea, I ask him: What kind of banker, in the 1950s, had his wife plugging away as a secretary? And why was there not enough money?\u000A\u000AFor a brief instant, the perfect smile and perfect manner and perfect answers to everything fade away.\u000A\u000AHe stops fussing with his tea, leans forward. \u0022My stepfather was a fantastic guy, a phenomenally talented guy,\u0022 he says. \u0022He could shoot, fish. He was an athlete—basketball, boxing, you name it. He had these phenomenally huge hands, he could palm a basketball. He was 53 years old when he married my mother. He\u0027d dropped out of high school, worked in a bank, then gone back to school, got a degree and traveled a circuit for the bank. Now, I\u0027m telling you all this so you\u0027ll understand what I\u0027m going to say. His first marriage collapsed because he was an alcoholic. In \u002753 and \u002754, he was in a sanitarium. When he got out, he worked his mother\u0027s farm—she was 90—he cut brush down there for a year. He married my mother [in November 1954]. He bought a worm-and-cricket farm, and had minnows too—you know, you put them in, like, a plastic bag and sell them. I used to work down there sometimes on weekends and in the summer. But the worm-and-cricket business is rough. It rains, say, Labor Day, and there goes a good part of your sales for the year.\u000A\u000A\u0022The business just didn\u0027t work out. So he sold it and eventually got a job with the civil service.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd then the general stops.\u000A\u000AWell, I ask, how did you get the money—given this failing worm-and-cricket trade—to go to military school?\u000A\u000AAnd he says his grandmother, his Jewish grandmother, Ida, who had immigrated from Minsk, she\u0027d left him a little money. And that bankrolled his school year and his first taste of his life\u0027s work.\u000A\u000AI can feel the general looking at me with hard eyes. I can sense he wonders if he betrayed something by talking about his late stepfather and his struggle with the bottle and with life. And I sense that his concern is not how this will play politically but how this will play with his own conscience. He has visited ground he seems not to venture into often. His first book is close to 500 pages long, and yet all he says of his stepfather is that he was a banker. And he says he did not know of his Jewish ancestry till years later because his mother did not tell him lest he face the punishing prejudices of the time. He makes no explanation as to how a legacy arrives from his grandmother Ida from Minsk without something clicking about his heritage in his A-student mind.\u000A\u000ABut what I can feel sitting there in the plush conference room in the Phoenix business tower, is the boy in the pool, the boy doing lap after lap all on his own, the boy who excels at everything he tries, the boy who at 17 goes gladly into the harsh regimen of West Point, the boy who thrives as a man living under the discipline of arms.\u000A\u000AThe interview is over. He shakes my hand, smiles warmly. His capos move in with those endless lists of things to do that constitute the grist of a campaign. Perfect order returns, and it no longer matters if it rains on Labor Day and no one comes to buy the crickets.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s back to political size, staring out from the television screen as the Democratic dustup in Phoenix goes down. During the debate, the general becomes a punching bag for the other candidates—Lieberman\u0027s staff alone circulates four of seven intra-debate press releases during the ninety-minute free-for-all calling the general a waffling dude with a big Republican stripe down his military back. And while he does not stumble, he comes off as mechanical and kind of dull. Then he\u0027s off to the NAACP conference in South Carolina and more events, back into the world of position papers, a horde of reporters parsing each statement as if they were safety engineers for some spaceship. They will continue to spin columns asking, Does he have what it takes, can he beat President Bush, is he nothing but a résumé? Some claim he\u0027s just a stalking horse for the Clintons. Some say he\u0027s just running to be vice president. Some say he\u0027s a nobody general who will fade once the real Democrats get a good look at him.\u000A\u000AMaybe, but I\u0027ll tell you what I think. He\u0027s running for president, and he is not used to losing. And if he gets the nomination, he\u0027ll go up and down this country and beat on President Bush like a drum. He\u0027ll do 2,000 yards every morning; he\u0027ll rappel down any cliff he needs to; he will shake off any small-arms fire as if it were a swarm of gnats. And he\u0027ll get better at the game each and every day.\u000A\u000AHe hates to lose. And he doesn\u0027t run from fights.\u000A\u000AAnd even if he\u0027s never played the game, he\u0027s never a beginner at anything.\u000A\u000ADismissed.\u000A\u000ACharles Bowden is a GQ writer at large.

The crowd at the music festival in El Dorado, Arkansas, swallows funnel cake, pigtail taters, cherry limeade, turkey legs and piles of barbecue. One side of the town square has become a parking lot for the Christian Motorcyclists Association, and the holy mamas parade by in their righteous leathers. On the other side are banks of stalls peddling T-shirts, most of which boast the Confederate flag, the faces of dead rebels or the admonition that these colors never run. For the general, an Arkansas boy, this is home.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.2">There is a dim sense in the happy crowd that he is coming, a beribboned boy with a Silver Star, a Purple Heart and the right accent. The general is the only Democrat running who can walk into a square like this, cut right through the smoke rising off the brisket, amble past the come-to-Jesus faces, the Jack Daniel&#x2019;s vitamin regimen, and be a homeboy. In a blue-and-red nation, he&#x2019;s the hope, the man who can cross the new color line and, by that act, decide the next election.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.3">Clark, hair trimmed, body a tight mass of muscle&#x2014;he&#x2019;s hardly gained a pound since West Point&#x2014;stands with his wife backstage. He&#x2019;s wrapped in a light blue pinstriped shirt, gold tie, olive slacks, brown shoes. She&#x2019;s a good-looking woman with a raft of blond hair, wearing a harvest gold blazer, gold earrings and a gold necklace. And then it&#x2019;s time, and he&#x2019;s out front alone, facing maybe more than 500 people, some holding placards his staff has just handed out like candy: WE LOVE WES; CLARK FOR PRESIDENT; THE GENERAL ELECTION; and EL DORADO LOVES CLARK.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.5">He begins, &quot;Wal, howz ever&#x2019;one doin&#x2019; this afternoon?&quot; and then slides into English. He tells them he needs their help, and then he launches into his story. Two weeks into his campaign, and the bones of his tale are starting to fall into place&#x2014;Little Rock boyhood, West Point, &quot;married a beautiful Yankee,&quot; and then the dealmaker: &quot;I went to Vietnam, got shot.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.6">He peddles his notions: Our country is &quot;unraveling&quot;; the world has stopped loving America; &quot;a great economy has fallen apart&quot;; the environment is being hit hard; poverty; health insurance&#x2026;the entire normal set of worry beads fingered by liberal Democrats.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.7">The crowd is polite but remains a dead calm of flesh.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.8">He says he is proud of our troops in Iraq but &quot;trouble is, I think we are asking them to do the wrong thing,&quot; and suddenly this becomes his first applause line. The general begins to look comfortable, and that big smile shines on his face.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.9">We need to spend the money here, not waste it over there, the general says. We need jobs, and this administration has lost them. He attacks President Bush. He even rolls out his New Patriotism idea, saying, &quot;It is not wrong to disagree; that&#x2019;s the highest form of democracy.&quot; This, too, gets applause.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.a">At the end of maybe fifteen minutes, there is polite applause and fifty or a hundred people stand up. The general hasn&#x2019;t set the place on fire, but he has gotten them listening amid the pork smoke that fills the air.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.b">The rope line forms to the right of the stage as the next act&#x2014;winners of the amateur singing contest&#x2014;belts out its songs. Clark, wife at side, no goon squad of security to protect him, listens and smiles at each handshake, handling each citizen like a priest in a confessional, having actual conversations rather than the customary grip-and-grab. He kisses babies, and each time the crowd surges in, cameras come out, and everyone watches carefully to see how he pulls off this traditional political task. He does just fine.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.c">All the crowd sees is Ol&#x2019; Wes, that Little Rock boy whose work took him away for a spell but who has come home now.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.d"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.e">He gets up at five or so each day and tries to get in 2,000 yards in the pool. (I&#x2019;ll save you the math: That&#x2019;s well over a mile.) Wherever he is, it takes 2,000 yards for Wes Clark to maintain. Lap after lap, the water wrapping his body, the world shut out, nothing but that line on the pool bottom and the strokes. He&#x2019;s been at it since boyhood, this swimming thing. If you want to know a little about who Wes Clark is, come down to the water.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.f">Swimming is not just ercise. Every stroke fights against resistance&#x2014;water is not easy, like air&#x2014;and the long-distance swimmer faces a tougher planet than that guy out on a run. And the water, thank God, feels warm and shuts over everything&#x2014;all the noise and color and talk, shuts it out until there is nothing but that line, that blue, those strokes, the discipline of breathing, and the flip turn at the end of the lane as the next lap rolls up. Take away the black line on the pool bottom and you&#x2019;re back to the womb.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.g">The general sits across the fine conference table on the seventh floor of the Ritz-Carlton in Phoenix. In a day, he will face down his competitors in a nationally televised forum of all the Democratic candidates. He&#x2019;s been living a blur of fund-raising phone calls&#x2014;just under two weeks out of the chute, he has rustled up more than $3.5 million, he&#x2019;s bagged key Hollywood backers, and, why, the day before in Tulsa, several big checkbooks showed up at a get-together for him in a private home&#x2014;and now he&#x2019;s running an hour late on his schedule. The general is not a man to be late. He sits with his shirt wrinkled&#x2014;a damn rare thing, because he cannot abide sloppy dress. He turns on that 150-watt smile and shakes hands firmly. The general has the ability to feel as comfortable as an old shoe and, at the same time, freeze a person with the eyes of Judgment Day.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.h">I ask him if he&#x2019;s frazzled by the pace of the campaign, and he swats the question away as if it were a pesky fly.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;I was four years as a four-star,&quot; he says crisply. &quot;I was in thirty-three countries in one twelve-month period.

In 1996, when the army sent him down to run Southern Command (all that ground from the Rio Grande to Tierra del Fuego), he picked up Spanish like one of those little liquor bottles they have on airliners. He speaks Russian, knows economics stone-cold, and in his army days was considered one of their most gifted strategists. He&#x2019;s not a guy who is going to be daunted by any to-do list.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.k">The general holds a reputation for being brilliant, for being brave (hell, when a vehicle full of negotiators went flying off the road during the Balkan war and fried the occupants to a crisp, Wes Clark immediately roped up and rappelled down through mined ground to see if they could be saved) and for always turning his units into crack outfits. And for not being very well liked. Twice the army tried to stop his career cold. This enmity stemmed from the army&#x2019;s traditional unease with highly educated warriors who ace West Point and then bag Rhodes scholarships because they might not be good commanders.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.l">He was admired as a commander (when he ran one outfit in the late &#x2019;80s, the officers under him were in awe, damn near died from the workload and privately called him POD, Prince of Darkness, for his exacting standards). He got practically every award and glowing report the military can give. Everything except an affectionate nickname. And when he won the first NATO war ever, he was summarily retired and humiliated. He&#x2019;d barely announced for president when his old boss, General Hugh Shelton, allowed as how he would never vote for Wes Clark, because of &quot;integrity and character issues.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.m"> <strong>A Day in the Life</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.n">You think you&#x2019;re busy?

He is state-of-the-art for making sure everyone in his command is taken care of&#x2014;back in Little Rock, where dozens of people work twenty-four-seven to keep his campaign rolling, he walks through his headquarters every week and talks to each and every staffer, introduces himself to all the new people, asks what they need, how&#x2019;s it goin&#x2019;. That&#x2019;s it in a nutshell: the claim that an all-star general with a warm manner never seemed to become one of the boys.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.14">So now I ask him just why Shelton bad-talked him. And suddenly the smile vanishes, the mouth becomes a hard line, the body stiffens, and Clark twirls both arms in the air. &quot;I don&#x2019;t know,&quot; he says, clearly rankled. He&#x2019;s picking his words carefully. &quot;All I was doing was my <em>duty.</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.15">The last time I&#x2019;d seen this look was on John McCain, and it came when I touched on the same ground, the turf a lot of Americans hardly seem to know, the one called personal honor. And when someone calls you on your integrity and character, well, that is a matter of personal honor. In the Balkan war, Clark headed a NATO that did not want to fight; faced down a genocidal dictator, Milosevic, whom he personally hated; fended off a Joint Chiefs and a Republican Congress that saw the place as a lose-lose situation dreamed up by the goddamn Clinton administration; and dealt with Defense Secretary William Cohen, who once sent an order to the general to &quot;get your fucking face off the TV,&quot; this last because Clark was pushing for a deeper engagement in a war the administration and the army wanted off-camera and forgotten.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.16">He pulled it all off by using television, by improvising, by playing politics and by doing the one thing he is really good at: refusing to lose. He won the war without losing a single American life. And they retired him early to humiliate him deliberately. Some of the top army brass did not even come to his retirement ceremony. And so it&#x2019;s damn hard not to believe that part of what fires General Clark&#x2019;s run for the job called commander in chief is this sudden and rude forced retirement dealt him by the army he gave his life to. He&#x2019;ll show them.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.17">After retiring, he went home to Little Rock, got on corporate boards, flew around the country giving speeches for twenty or thirty grand a crack, became the military expert on CNN. And this did not feel right. Because there is a part of Wes Clark that at first does not seem to quite fit. He&#x2019;s lived pretty well in the military&#x2014;after all, when he ran NATO he had his own ch&amp;#xE2;teau and a fleet of planes to take him around. And he&#x2019;s connected to all the Little Rock money and lives in a nice house. But he doesn&#x2019;t seem to care much about money. Or the people who have it. He says things like, In the army a general gets maybe ten or twelve times what a grunt earns, and that seems to him about the right ratio. He says there is something wrong with CEOs getting 500 to 600 times what a working stiff makes.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.18">Out on the campaign trail, he talks of service and sacrifice. At times it sounds like the usual political crap, but then, at times, there is this edge. When he stood in the Transportation Workers Union hall in Tulsa, filled with American Airlines maintenance workers who had taken a pay cut to keep their corporation alive, Clark said to loud cheers, &quot;If you&#x2019;re giving up 10 percent of your pay, those ecutives should be giving up 30 percent or 40 percent of their pay.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.19">And he&#x2019;s got one deep political talent; he can dance across America&#x2019;s great divide: race. A few days before, the general was the guest at Philander Smith College in Little Rock, a black Methodist school started after the Civil War to educate freed slaves. They ate him up. The blacks in the audience cheered him on, amened him, because they felt comfortable with him. He wasn&#x2019;t some white guy being polite; he was at ease with them and they knew it. They sensed a different color in the man.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1a">Which is part of why Clark both attracts and frightens Democrats. He has only just registered in the party. He voted for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and has said kind words about both Bushes. He&#x2019;s a general trying to win the nomination of a party that shies away from military things. But when the Democratic Party goes south, heads into those places where funnel cake hits the spot and guns are natural (the general has about twenty himself), who can they roll out into all those courthouse squares who can get the votes?</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1c">And, my God, does he have plans&#x2014;for jump-starting the economy, fixing education, dealing with Iraq&#x2014;and they all seem to have three points, which he ticks off on three fingers. He&#x2019;s moving right now among the booths and tables of Coney&#x2019;s &#x2019;N&#x2019; More Cafe, a ham-and-egger in Fort Dodge, Iowa, where the local business guys get together in the morning to talk and run the town. Every spot in rural America has such a joint.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1d">The town itself has been dying for decades. When I ask one guy about local economic opportunities, he looks up and says, &quot;It ain&#x2019;t shit.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1e">The general is working the tables, taking too long in his answers; he really seems to believe in answering questions rather than simply pressing the flesh. He is a born missionary, a man who almost glows when he repeats the army slogan &quot;Be all that you can be.&quot; The crowd of Iowans is respectful but not easily won; presidential candidates descend here like locusts every four years. One table of veterans causes a brief dustup when one of them says the Dems are not supporting the troops in Iraq, and Clark will have none of it, not a bit. By God, whatever disagreements he may have with the administration over policy, the general does not leave the troops hanging. He&#x2019;s got those wounds.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1f">Over that cup of tea in Phoenix, he ticked them off for me. &quot;Got clipped&#x2014;<em>barummmph,</em>&quot; he notes of that bloody little patrol he was leading as a young officer in Vietnam. One in the hand, one in the leg, one in the shoulder and &quot;something that went through my butt.&quot; He got the Silver Star for bravery and a Purple Heart. But the key is that he never surrendered command and he got his outfit through the firefight. And then spent a good year forcing his body back so he could run, forcing his hand back so he could shoot. Like a lot of men who have been in combat, he&#x2019;s not keen on war. A set point in the general&#x2019;s stump speech is his smacking one fist into the other and noting that using force is &quot;only, only, only a last resort.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1g">I ask him who his favorite general is, and he instantly says U. S. Grant. Clark has studied all the military heroes, and he has boiled greatness down to three key elements: &quot;vision, personal humility and the capacity to be present at the decisive point and work his magic at the decisive point.&quot; Which leads to his late entry into the race, one the experts say is too late for him to raise enough money, too late to build an organization in the key primary states. The general dodges questions on this, talking, like a lifetime politician gifted with vacuous gab, about how &quot;I didn&#x2019;t make the decision until then,&quot; meaning September. &quot;You can&#x2019;t decide to do this,&quot; he continues, &quot;until you decide it&#x2019;s the right thing to do.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1h">Maybe, but he waited until the Iraq campaign plainly became the fuckup he&#x2019;d predicted in his speeches; he waited until it became clear that the other Democratic candidates were not setting the electorate on fire&#x2014;none of them, not even Dr. Dean, who has created an astounding grassroots movement but still hasn&#x2019;t reached beyond the same demographics as Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s ice cream. Clark waited until the president&#x2019;s numbers started sinking in the undertow of a bad economy, bad intelligence and a messy war.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1i">There are people out there who would vote for a dog over Bush. And there are southerners and moderates and independents who feel uneasy about the deficit and the war but who do not like to criticize their president in wartime. And then this general from Arkansas shows up with a chest of medals and says, &quot;Our country is at risk, our country is in a crisis.&#x2026; It&#x2019;s not wrong to ask questions; that&#x2019;s the highest form of democracy.&#x2026; We want government that leads, not dictates.&quot; And suddenly, there is a way to love the flag, support the troops, but speak up about things and still be patriotic. And the general wants to show them how.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1j"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1k">He&#x2019;s not big enough to be a general. He stands about five ten but looks shorter because he&#x2019;s so tightly muscled, a coiled force rather than some big beefy four-star guy. He moves with an athlete&#x2019;s grace, the body always centered, the step light. His hands are graceful also, almost delicate. His voice has that command force but is low-key and congenial. The smile flashes so often you want to swat it at times, but still, the general manages to put people at ease.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1l">Even at my ease, I still wonder: Who is this guy? What&#x2019;s written on the page after the r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; stops? We&#x2019;ve been plowing through the leadership stuff (George Washington, Abe Lincoln) and waltzing around about books (he likes Saul Bellow, John Updike), and we touched on his son, Wes Jr., who is a screenwriter in Los Angeles, not a military guy.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1m">The general says, &quot;My son told me, &#x2019;I can&#x2019;t work normal hours. When I shave in the morning, it screws up my face. I&#x2019;m just going to have to be a writer.&#x2019; &quot; Which all sounds fine. Just as his wife, Gert, seems fine, tastefully dressed, smart, attractive&#x2014;the natural complement for a general. He affectionately calls her &quot;the general&#x2019;s general&quot; and credits her with one of his best applause lines: &quot;If conservatives were compassionate, why would you have to announce it by putting the word <em>compassionate</em> ahead of <em>conservative</em>?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1n">After you have been around Clark awhile, it all seems too perfect, too mannered, too friendly. Too programmed. In the end, we ask of candidates more than their r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;s; we want to know about something that West Point and Oord do not give degrees in, a thing called character, a quality called fire, that spark of life that inspires trust and permits a nation of more than 290 million to have faith in some guy they have never had a beer with. Of course, for a lot of Democrats it is simply the fantasy of running a general and clobbering Republicans.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1o">But I want more. I want to know where the hunger came from that propelled him to West Point, to rice paddies, to that fourth star, to mountains in the Balkans and now, with his pension assured and his country-club life in the bag, into strange towns to meet Christian bikers and kiss babies. I keep stumbling over one paragraph in Clark&#x2019;s book on the Balkan war that runs, &quot;I was born in Chicago. My father, Benjamin Kanne, was a lawyer and Democratic Party politician there.&#x2026; My father died when I was not quite 4. My mother&#x2026;returned to live with her parents in Arkansas and remarried a former banker.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1p">What makes me stumble is that Clark says in his speeches that his mother worked as a bank secretary for forty bucks a week and that he knows what it&#x2019;s like not to have a lot of money. So as we sit in Phoenix and he sips his tea, I ask him: What kind of banker, in the 1950s, had his wife plugging away as a secretary? And why was there not enough money?</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1q">For a brief instant, the perfect smile and perfect manner and perfect answers to everything fade away.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1r">He stops fussing with his tea, leans forward. &quot;My stepfather was a fantastic guy, a phenomenally talented guy,&quot; he says. &quot;He could shoot, fish. He was an athlete&#x2014;basketball, boxing, you name it. He had these phenomenally huge hands, he could palm a basketball. He was 53 years old when he married my mother. He&#x2019;d dropped out of high school, worked in a bank, then gone back to school, got a degree and traveled a circuit for the bank. Now, I&#x2019;m telling you all this so you&#x2019;ll understand what I&#x2019;m going to say. His first marriage collapsed because he was an alcoholic. In &#x2019;53 and &#x2019;54, he was in a sanitarium. When he got out, he worked his mother&#x2019;s farm&#x2014;she was 90&#x2014;he cut brush down there for a year. He married my mother [in November 1954]. He bought a worm-and-cricket farm, and had minnows too&#x2014;you know, you put them in, like, a plastic bag and sell them. I used to work down there sometimes on weekends and in the summer. But the worm-and-cricket business is rough. It rains, say, Labor Day, and there goes a good part of your sales for the year.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1s">&quot;The business just didn&#x2019;t work out. So he sold it and eventually got a job with the civil service.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1t">And then the general stops.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1u">Well, I ask, how did you get the money&#x2014;given this failing worm-and-cricket trade&#x2014;to go to military school?</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1v">And he says his grandmother, his Jewish grandmother, Ida, who had immigrated from Minsk, she&#x2019;d left him a little money. And that bankrolled his school year and his first taste of his life&#x2019;s work.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1w">I can feel the general looking at me with hard eyes. I can sense he wonders if he betrayed something by talking about his late stepfather and his struggle with the bottle and with life. And I sense that his concern is not how this will play politically but how this will play with his own conscience. He has visited ground he seems not to venture into often. His first book is close to 500 pages long, and yet all he says of his stepfather is that he was a banker. And he says he did not know of his Jewish ancestry till years later because his mother did not tell him lest he face the punishing prejudices of the time. He makes no explanation as to how a legacy arrives from his grandmother Ida from Minsk without something clicking about his heritage in his A-student mind.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1x">But what I can feel sitting there in the plush conference room in the Phoenix business tower, is the boy in the pool, the boy doing lap after lap all on his own, the boy who excels at everything he tries, the boy who at 17 goes gladly into the harsh regimen of West Point, the boy who thrives as a man living under the discipline of arms.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1y">The interview is over. He shakes my hand, smiles warmly. His capos move in with those endless lists of things to do that constitute the grist of a campaign. Perfect order returns, and it no longer matters if it rains on Labor Day and no one comes to buy the crickets.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.1z"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.20">He&#x2019;s back to political size, staring out from the television screen as the Democratic dustup in Phoenix goes down. During the debate, the general becomes a punching bag for the other candidates&#x2014;Lieberman&#x2019;s staff alone circulates four of seven intra-debate press releases during the ninety-minute free-for-all calling the general a waffling dude with a big Republican stripe down his military back. And while he does not stumble, he comes off as mechanical and kind of dull. Then he&#x2019;s off to the NAACP conference in South Carolina and more events, back into the world of position papers, a horde of reporters parsing each statement as if they were safety engineers for some spaceship. They will continue to spin columns asking, Does he have what it takes, can he beat President Bush, is he nothing but a r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;? Some claim he&#x2019;s just a stalking horse for the Clintons. Some say he&#x2019;s just running to be vice president. Some say he&#x2019;s a nobody general who will fade once the real Democrats get a good look at him.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.21">Maybe, but I&#x2019;ll tell you what I think. He&#x2019;s running for president, and he is not used to losing. And if he gets the nomination, he&#x2019;ll go up and down this country and beat on President Bush like a drum. He&#x2019;ll do 2,000 yards every morning; he&#x2019;ll rappel down any cliff he needs to; he will shake off any small-arms fire as if it were a swarm of gnats. And he&#x2019;ll get better at the game each and every day.</p><p data-reactid=".1dszmfckoao.1.1.0.0.4.22">He hates to lose.
