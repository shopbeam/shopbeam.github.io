  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestPhoto: Instagram\u000A\u000AIt was only last month that a federal criminal complaint revealed that hotel scion Conrad Hughes Hilton III—brother of Paris, crasher of luxury vehicles, and all-around spoiled brat—had perpetrated a 10-hour, proletariat-bashing rage-a-thon aboard a trans-Atlantic jet. Now GQ can exclusively report that last week, Hilton entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors. Today, on Hilton\u0027s 21st birthday, it seemed an excellent time to relive the events of July 31, 2014, aboard British Airways flight 269 from London to Los Angeles.\u000A\u000AThe tantrum began even before takeoff, which was scheduled for 3:52 p.m., when Hilton—flying in business class, in seat 75J, on the upper deck of an Airbus 380—refused to turn off his cell phone. Things escalated rapidly once the flight was in the air, and soon Hilton was smoking weed in the bathroom, punching the bulkhead, and repeatedly bellowing, \u0022I will fucking own anyone on this flight; they are fucking peasants!\u0022 \u000A\u000APatricia Mitchell, a British-born life coach and broadcaster who lives in L.A., was seated in economy on the lower deck, where Hilton would soon appear, ranting and mumbling, and reappear sporadically as he wandered the plane. Herewith, a chronology of the flight, based on 1) the criminal complaint filed on February 2, which is a sworn affidavit by the FBI agent who investigated the case, and 2) my extensive interview with Mitchell, in 81H, who does, after all, analyze human behavior for a living.\u000A\u000AAt about 5:20 p.m., five minutes after a late takeoff, Hilton leaves his seat, ignoring the illuminated \u0022Fasten Seatbelt\u0022 sign, and heads to the rear galley of the main deck. [Note: For the rest of this story, everything in bold type comes from the criminal complaint.]\u000A\u000APATRICIA MITCHELL: It was during that bit when the stewards are up but nobody else should be. My ears were popping, and I was waiting for the drinks trolley, when suddenly, he\u0027s coming down the aisle. I thought, \u0022Whoa, that\u0027s not normal.\u0022 He was dressed posh casual, expensive haircut. He looked like a polo player and walked with a sure-footed march, being loud. He said something like they had attacked him. I heard a lot of \u0022fucks.\u0022 The staff were being really low key, but it was monstrous. Inhuman. I mean, really, it was.\u000A\u000AFour members of the crew ask Hilton to return to his seat, but he refuses, saying that if they are standing, he should be allowed to stand, too. He\u0027s cursing and being aggressive. He says he has \u0022a fucking problem\u0022 and threatens to hit someone seated four rows behind him.\u000A\u000AP.M.: He was being demeaning. I thought he was in the middle of a psychotic episode. For at least an hour I was thinking: are we going to have to go back? Are they going to turn the plane around?\u000A\u000AHilton returns to his seat briefly, but once the seatbelt sign is turned off, he appears again in the rear galley and complains about a male passenger giving him the \u0022stink eye.\u0022 He is highly agitated and says the man \u0022either wants to fight me or fuck me but I am not gay.\u0022 \u000A\u000AP.M.: I was about to video it, but he looked at me, really threatening. I don\u0027t often watch horror movies, but you know how the walking dead have a look in their eye? I thought, \u0022He\u0027s going to come at me next.\u0022 He turned around and said, \u0022Now everybody\u0027s judging me.\u0022 That\u0027s when they closed the curtains.\u000A\u000AShortly after 6 p.m., drink service begins from the rear galley—not from the front, as it usually does—because Hilton is standing in the aisle, blocking the flight attendants\u0027 path. Hilton is yelling at passengers and at the crew, one member of which has been assigned to follow him around, like a chaperone.\u000A\u000AP.M.: I was kind of fascinated. But also, the adrenaline was up. I was on alert. There are rules—social rules—on a plane. I was watching how other people were reacting. Some people were completely oblivious. But the father of a French family right behind me stood up and was leaning over his kids, shielding them.\u000A\u000AAs Hilton wanders around the plane, he lashes out at the customer service manager who is shadowing him to protect the passengers and his 21-member crew. \u0022Stop following me!\u0022 Hilton yells, adding: \u0022I am going to fucking kill you!\u0022 Hilton points his finger in the attendant\u0027s face, shouting, \u0022I will fucking rip through you!\u0022 and \u0022I will fucking own you!\u0022 \u000A\u000AP.M.: They were watching him. Sometimes he was effing and blinding [that\u0027s British for screaming obscenities] and sometimes he was just walking along, and I just thought, \u0022Wow, it\u0027s like he\u0027s got a nanny. It\u0027s unbelievable how much attention he\u0027s getting.\u0022\u000A\u000AHilton wanders into the Club World Galley in business class. When a flight attendant tries to calm him down, Hilton gets very close to his face, pulls back, swings his fist up and punches the bulkhead 10 centimeters away from the attendant\u0027s head. Hilton\u0027s behavior is reported to the captain and three hours into the flight, at about 8:15 pm London time, five crewmembers assemble for a safety briefing to review the airline\u0027s passenger restraint policy. A crew member will later estimate he will leave his seat 20 times in total.\u000A\u000AP.M.: He kept coming back. I didn\u0027t know whether to pity him or loathe him. At one point, I jumped up to use the loo because there wasn\u0027t a line. I did it quickly, without looking, and I bumped into someone and said, \u0022Oh, sorry.\u0022 I looked up, and it was him! It was like [gasps] the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. And he just said, \u0022Oh, no problem.\u0022 Like a normal, ordinary human. That was weird.\u000A\u000ANumerous times, Hilton yells, \u0022I will fucking own anyone on this flight; they are fucking peasants!\u0022 At one point he approaches another flight attendant and brags that he is already banned by other airlines. He says he has issues, that he\u0027s just broken up with a girlfriend, and that his behavior will probably turn into a lawsuit for his father to pay. He laments that he wants to smoke marijuana. At around 9:15 p.m., he locks himself in a lower deck restroom; soon the smell of weed is detected in the cabin. When a crewmember knocks, he exits, runs to an upper deck bathroom, stuffs the smoke detector with paper towels and smokes a cigarette. Upon exiting, he surrenders his lighter and cigarettes, returns to his seat and falls asleep.\u000A\u000AP.M.: It\u0027s funny because I flew premium on my outbound from L.A. to London, and we were asking the air stewardess, \u0022Come on—who have you had that\u0027s famous?\u0022 And, \u0022Who was nice and who wasn\u0027t?\u0022 And she was spilling the beans and saying the nicest person is Mick Jagger. For all of his money and notoriety, she said, he\u0027s all: \u0022Thank you, thank you!\u0022 She said Gordon Ramsay is really nice, too, but he won\u0027t eat the food. And here you have this little upstart who\u0027s a nobody, being like, \u0022I\u0027m this and I\u0027m that!\u0022 He\u0027s been taught a certain way to communicate with people, and it\u0027s clearly not working. He looked deeply unhappy.\u000A\u000AWhen Hilton wakes up about an hour later, he approaches yet another flight attendant and says he\u0027s \u0022going to fucking kill\u0022 him three times. He grabs the man\u0027s shirt and name badge saying, \u0022I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss!\u0022 He says, \u0022My father will pay this out, he has done it before. Dad paid $300,000 last time.\u0022 \u000A\u000AP.M.: What a waste of money.\u000A\u000AAt one point, Hilton says to the co-pilot, who\u0027d come out from the flight deck in the hopes that his authority would subdue Hilton, \u0022If you wanna square up to me, bro, then bring it on and I will fucking fight you.\u0022 Every time Hilton has another altercation with the crew, the captain is alerted via the intercom. Such alerts are continual throughout the flight, and no crewmembers are able to take their full mandated rest breaks. Finally, the co-pilot comes out from the flight deck to present Hilton with a final written warning. Hilton rips it up.\u000A\u000AP.M.: God, he\u0027s an asshole. But the British Airways crew was incredibly professional. Someone was always walking behind him, hands to the side, nothing threatening, looking down, not confrontational. And if we asked how things were, they were calm, smiling. It was really impressive. If you hadn\u0027t had the staff doing exactly what they did, it could have got very nasty.\u000A\u000AAt 2:20 a.m. London time, a second safety briefing is held to discuss restraining Hilton, who is again asleep. Shortly thereafter, crewmembers use a blanket and handcuffs to secure Hilton, who wakes up screaming. Among other things, he says he is a model and the crew is \u0022going to ruin my career.\u0022\u000A\u000AP.M.: A buzz went around the plane that he had been restrained and we were all, \u0022Fantastic. Good. Happy about that.\u0022\u000A\u000AAt about 3:35 a.m. London time [7:35 p.m. Los Angeles time], Flight 269 lands. Police come aboard and escort the handcuffed Hilton to the terminal. \u000A\u000AP.M.: I remember coming off and seeing him sitting on a bench with what I assume was some kind of federal agent. You would have thought butter wouldn\u0027t melt in his mouth, he was so cool. He looked all innocent, like, \u0022I don\u0027t know what the fuss is all about.\u0022 He just turned it on, like: Okay, I\u0027m on American soil, and I know how to play this game. He looked like he was having the first day at a new job and wanted to make a good impression.\u000A\u000A FBI agent David Gates presents Hilton with an FD-395 Advice of Rights form, which Gates reads to him as he reads along. Hilton says he understands, signing his name and waiving his rights. Then, he agrees to an interview in which he says, among other things, that he had not drunk any alcoholic beverages on the plane or before boarding, but he did take a sleeping pill. He brags that he has \u0022buried\u0022 the flight attendants and admits to having called people \u0022peasants.\u0022 He also says there was a man at the back of the plane who calmed him down. \u0022If that man wasn\u0027t there,\u0022 he says, \u0022that guy [the flight attendant] would have been fucking killed on that flight. A hundred percent I would have killed him.\u0022 When the FBI agent asks whether Hilton is serious, he replies, \u0022No, but I would have knocked him the fuck out. A hundred percent.\u0022 When the agent reads part of the law regarding interference with flight attendants, Hilton interrupts him. \u0022I did intimidate. But, through defense. He came up to me with his nose.\u0022\u000A\u000AP.M.: I spoke to one of the crew when I got off the plane. I said, \u0022I bet you want a hot bath, don\u0027t you, after this?\u0022 And she said, \u0022Oh, yeah, and a bottle of wine.\u0022 Or maybe I said wine and she said bath. She was British, remember. You could just tell that they were all just really glad that the little bugger had got off the plane and they had survived.\u000A\u000AHilton\u0027s lawyer, Robert Shapiro, tells TMZ.com that the sleeping pill Hilton says he took before the flight may have caused his behavior. TMZ also reports that immediately after the incident, Hilton voluntarily checked into a 30-day in-patient drug and alcohol treatment program. On February 2, Hilton is charged with intimidating or assaulting the flight crew to the point where he interfered with their ability to perform their duties—an offense punishable by up to 20 years in prison. He is released on $100,000 bail.\u000A\u000AP.M.: If you were on a desert island, Hilton would be the weakest link, wouldn\u0027t he? Let\u0027s face it. He\u0027d be the one about whom everyone would say, \u0022Oh, shit, don\u0027t get him to do anything. He\u0027ll balls it up.\u0022 But this could be the making of him. Have you ever seen a movie called Captains Courageous with Spencer Tracy? I can\u0027t watch it without bursting into tears. Tracy is this old Portuguese fisherman, and this rich kid falls off the back of an ocean liner and Tracy picks him up. And the spoiled kid does a Conrad Hilton. He says, like, \u0022Do you know who I am??\u0022 And Tracy just takes him on and teaches him to be a good person. It\u0027s so touching. You see the transition. It\u0027s beautiful.\u000A\u000AEpilogue: On February 23, Hilton agrees to plead guilty to one count of simple assault, i.e. \u0022intentionally using a display of force that reasonably caused a person to fear immediate bodily harm.\u0022 According to the plea agreement, he faces a maximum sentence of six months\u0027 imprisonment followed by a year of supervised release and a fine of $5,000. His arraignment is scheduled for March 5. \u000A\u000AAMY WALLACE (@msamywallace) is a GQ correspondent.",

III&#x2014;brother of Paris, crasher of luxury vehicles, and all-around spoiled brat&#x2014;had perpetrated a 10-hour, proletariat-bashing rage-a-thon aboard a trans-Atlantic jet. Now GQ can exclusively report that last week, Hilton entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors. Today, on Hilton&#x2019;s 21st birthday, it seemed an excellent time to relive the events of July 31, 2014, aboard British Airways flight 269 from London to Los Angeles.</em></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.2"><em>The tantrum began even before takeoff, which was scheduled for 3:52 p.m., when Hilton&#x2014;flying in business class, in seat 75J, on the upper deck of an Airbus 380&#x2014;refused to turn off his cell phone. Things escalated rapidly once the flight was in the air, and soon Hilton was smoking weed in the bathroom, punching the bulkhead, and repeatedly bellowing, &quot;I will fucking own anyone on this flight; they are fucking peasants!&quot; </em></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.3"><em>Patricia Mitchell, a British-born life coach and broadcaster who lives in L.A., was seated in economy on the lower deck, where Hilton would soon appear, ranting and mumbling, and reappear sporadically as he wandered the plane. Herewith, a chronology of the flight, based on 1) the criminal complaint filed on February 2, which is a sworn affidavit by the FBI agent who investigated the case, and 2) my extensive interview with Mitchell, in 81H, who does, after all, analyze human behavior for a living.</em></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>At about 5:20 p.m., five minutes after a late takeoff, Hilton leaves his seat, ignoring the illuminated &quot;Fasten Seatbelt&quot; sign, and heads to the rear galley of the main deck. </strong><strong>[Note: For the rest of this story, everything in bold type comes from the criminal complaint.]</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.6">PATRICIA MITCHELL: It was during that bit when the stewards are up but nobody else should be. My ears were popping, and I was waiting for the drinks trolley, when suddenly, he&#x2019;s coming down the aisle. I thought, &quot;Whoa, that&#x2019;s not normal.&quot; He was dressed posh casual, expensive haircut. He looked like a polo player and walked with a sure-footed march, being loud. He said something like they had attacked him. I heard a lot of &quot;fucks.&quot; The staff were being really low key, but it was monstrous. Inhuman. I mean, really, it was.</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Four members of the crew ask Hilton to return to his seat, but he refuses, saying that if they are standing, he should be allowed to stand, too. He&#x2019;s cursing and being aggressive. He says he has &quot;a fucking problem&quot; and threatens to hit someone seated four rows behind him.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.8">P.M.: He was being demeaning. I thought he was in the middle of a psychotic episode. For at least an hour I was thinking: are we going to have to go back? Are they going to turn the plane around?</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>Hilton returns to his seat briefly, but once the seatbelt sign is turned off, he appears again in the rear galley and complains about a male passenger giving him the &quot;stink eye.&quot; He is highly agitated and says the man &quot;either wants to fight me or fuck me but I am not gay.&quot; </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.a">P.M.: I was about to video it, but he looked at me, really threatening. I don&#x2019;t often watch horror movies, but you know how the walking dead have a look in their eye? I thought, &quot;He&#x2019;s going to come at me next.&quot; He turned around and said, &quot;Now everybody&#x2019;s judging me.&quot; That&#x2019;s when they closed the curtains.</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Shortly after 6 p.m., drink service begins from the rear galley&#x2014;not from the front, as it usually does&#x2014;because Hilton is standing in the aisle, blocking the flight attendants&#x2019; path. Hilton is yelling at passengers and at the crew, one member of which has been assigned to follow him around, like a chaperone.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.c">P.M.: I was kind of fascinated. But also, the adrenaline was up. I was on alert. There are rules&#x2014;social rules&#x2014;on a plane. I was watching how other people were reacting. Some people were completely oblivious. But the father of a French family right behind me stood up and was leaning over his kids, shielding them.</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>As Hilton wanders around the plane, he lashes out at the customer service manager who is shadowing him to protect the passengers and his 21-member crew. &quot;Stop following me!&quot; Hilton yells, adding: &quot;I am going to fucking kill you!&quot; Hilton points his finger in the attendant&#x2019;s face, shouting, &quot;I will fucking rip through you!&quot; and &quot;I will fucking own you!&quot; </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.e">P.M.: They were watching him. Sometimes he was effing and blinding [that&#x2019;s British for screaming obscenities] and sometimes he was just walking along, and I just thought, &quot;Wow, it&#x2019;s like he&#x2019;s got a nanny. It&#x2019;s unbelievable how much attention he&#x2019;s getting.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Hilton wanders into the Club World Galley in business class. When a flight attendant tries to calm him down, Hilton gets very close to his face, pulls back, swings his fist up and punches the bulkhead 10 centimeters away from the attendant&#x2019;s head. Hilton&#x2019;s behavior is reported to the captain and three hours into the flight, at about 8:15 pm London time, five crewmembers assemble for a safety briefing to review the airline&#x2019;s passenger restraint policy. A crew member will later estimate he will leave his seat 20 times in total.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.g">P.M.: He kept coming back. I didn&#x2019;t know whether to pity him or loathe him. At one point, I jumped up to use the loo because there wasn&#x2019;t a line. I did it quickly, without looking, and I bumped into someone and said, &quot;Oh, sorry.&quot; I looked up, and it was him! It was like [gasps] the Child Catcher in <em>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.</em> And he just said, &quot;Oh, no problem.&quot; Like a normal, ordinary human. That was weird.</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>Numerous times, Hilton yells, &quot;I will fucking own anyone on this flight; they are fucking peasants!&quot; At one point he approaches another flight attendant and brags that he is already banned by other airlines. He says he has issues, that he&#x2019;s just broken up with a girlfriend, and that his behavior will probably turn into a lawsuit for his father to pay. He laments that he wants to smoke marijuana. At around 9:15 p.m., he locks himself in a lower deck restroom; soon the smell of weed is detected in the cabin. When a crewmember knocks, he exits, runs to an upper deck bathroom, stuffs the smoke detector with paper towels and smokes a cigarette. Upon exiting, he surrenders his lighter and cigarettes, returns to his seat and falls asleep.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.i">P.M.: It&#x2019;s funny because I flew premium on my outbound from L.A. to London, and we were asking the air stewardess, &quot;Come on&#x2014;who have you had that&#x2019;s famous?&quot; And, &quot;Who was nice and who wasn&#x2019;t?&quot; And she was spilling the beans and saying the nicest person is Mick Jagger. For all of his money and notoriety, she said, he&#x2019;s all: &quot;Thank you, thank you!&quot; She said Gordon Ramsay is really nice, too, but he won&#x2019;t eat the food. And here you have this little upstart who&#x2019;s a nobody, being like, &quot;I&#x2019;m this and I&#x2019;m that!&quot; He&#x2019;s been taught a certain way to communicate with people, and it&#x2019;s clearly not working. He looked deeply unhappy.</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>When Hilton wakes up about an hour later, he approaches yet another flight attendant and says he&#x2019;s &quot;going to fucking kill&quot; him three times. He grabs the man&#x2019;s shirt and name badge saying, &quot;I could get you all fired in five minutes. I know your boss!&quot; He says, &quot;My father will pay this out, he has done it before. Dad paid $300,000 last time.&quot; </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.k">P.M.: What a waste of money.</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>At one point, Hilton says to the co-pilot, who&#x2019;d come out from the flight deck in the hopes that his authority would subdue Hilton, &quot;If you wanna square up to me, bro, then bring it on and I will fucking fight you.&quot;</strong> <strong>Every time Hilton has another altercation with the crew, the captain is alerted via the intercom. Such alerts are continual throughout the flight, and no crewmembers are able to take their full mandated rest breaks. Finally, the co-pilot comes out from the flight deck to present Hilton with a final written warning. Hilton rips it up.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.m">P.M.: God, he&#x2019;s an asshole. But the British Airways crew was incredibly professional. Someone was always walking behind him, hands to the side, nothing threatening, looking down, not confrontational. And if we asked how things were, they were calm, smiling. It was really impressive. If you hadn&#x2019;t had the staff doing exactly what they did, it could have got very nasty.</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>At 2:20 a.m. London time, a second safety briefing is held to discuss restraining Hilton, who is again asleep. Shortly thereafter, crewmembers use a blanket and handcuffs to secure Hilton, who wakes up screaming. Among other things, he says he is a model and the crew is &quot;going to ruin my career.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.o">P.M.: A buzz went around the plane that he had been restrained and we were all, &quot;Fantastic. Good. Happy about that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>At about 3:35 a.m. London time [7:35 p.m. Los Angeles time], Flight 269 lands. Police come aboard and escort the handcuffed Hilton to the terminal. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.q">P.M.: I remember coming off and seeing him sitting on a bench with what I assume was some kind of federal agent. You would have thought butter wouldn&#x2019;t melt in his mouth, he was so cool. He looked all innocent, like, &quot;I don&#x2019;t know what the fuss is all about.&quot; He just turned it on, like: <em>Okay, I&#x2019;m on American soil, and I know how to play this game</em>. He looked like he was having the first day at a new job and wanted to make a good impression.</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong> FBI agent David Gates presents Hilton with an FD-395 Advice of Rights form, which Gates reads to him as he reads along. Hilton says he understands, signing his name and waiving his rights. Then, he agrees to an interview in which he says, among other things, that he had not drunk any alcoholic beverages on the plane or before boarding, but he did take a sleeping pill. He brags that he has &quot;buried&quot; the flight attendants and admits to having called people &quot;peasants.&quot; He also says there was a man at the back of the plane who calmed him down. &quot;If that man wasn&#x2019;t there,&quot; he says, &quot;that guy [the flight attendant] would have been fucking killed on that flight. A hundred percent I would have killed him.&quot; When the FBI agent asks whether Hilton is serious, he replies, &quot;No, but I would have knocked him the fuck out. A hundred percent.&quot; When the agent reads part of the law regarding interference with flight attendants, Hilton interrupts him. &quot;I did intimidate. But, through defense. He came up to me with his nose.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.s">P.M.: I spoke to one of the crew when I got off the plane. I said, &quot;I bet you want a hot bath, don&#x2019;t you, after this?&quot; And she said, &quot;Oh, yeah, and a bottle of wine.&quot; Or maybe I said wine and she said bath. She was British, remember. You could just tell that they were all just really glad that the little bugger had got off the plane and they had survived.</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.t"><em>Hilton&#x2019;s lawyer, Robert Shapiro, tells TMZ.com that the sleeping pill Hilton says he took before the flight may have caused his behavior. TMZ also reports that immediately after the incident, Hilton voluntarily checked into a 30-day in-patient drug and alcohol treatment program. On February 2, Hilton is charged with intimidating or assaulting the flight crew to the point where he interfered with their ability to perform their duties&#x2014;an offense punishable by up to 20 years in prison. He is released on $100,000 bail.</em></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.u">P.M.: If you were on a desert island, Hilton would be the weakest link, wouldn&#x2019;t he? Let&#x2019;s face it. He&#x2019;d be the one about whom everyone would say, &quot;Oh, shit, don&#x2019;t get him to do anything. He&#x2019;ll balls it up.&quot; But this could be the making of him. Have you ever seen a movie called <em>Captains Courageous</em> with Spencer Tracy? I can&#x2019;t watch it without bursting into tears. Tracy is this old Portuguese fisherman, and this rich kid falls off the back of an ocean liner and Tracy picks him up. And the spoiled kid does a Conrad Hilton. He says, like, &quot;Do you know who I <em>am</em>??&quot; And Tracy just takes him on and teaches him to be a good person. It&#x2019;s so touching. You see the transition. It&#x2019;s beautiful.</p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.v"><em>Epilogue: On February 23, Hilton agrees to plead guilty to one count of simple assault, i.e. &quot;intentionally using a display of force that reasonably caused a person to fear immediate bodily harm.&quot; According to the <a href="http://blog.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/Hilton_plea_agreement.pdf">plea agreement</a>, he faces a maximum sentence of six months&#x2019; imprisonment followed by a year of supervised release and a fine of $5,000. His arraignment is scheduled for March 5. </em></p><p data-reactid=".1iz1pxqt2io.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong><a href="../contributors/amy-wallace">AMY WALLACE</a></strong> (@<a
