  	    "articleBody": "I went to Skid Row to report the life and death of Charly \u0022Africa\u0022 Keunang, an unarmed homeless man held down and then shot six times by Los Angeles police officers. Charly was killed beneath the fig tree in the background of the photograph below. That was where he lived before they killed him, too, so I made it the heart of my reporting. I went to ask questions about Charly; but to do so I had to get to know the people of whom I was asking these questions, and in the process I was fortunate enough to encounter many lives as rich and complex and worth knowing as Charly\u0027s. Here are a few of them. Not a collective portrait of Skid Row, the densest homeless district in the United States—that would require ten times as many stories just to begin—but a few facets: respect, generosity, courage; grief, addiction, insanity. \u000A\u000AOn Skid Row, someone who is thought to be especially mentally ill is referred to as \u0022fifty-one fifty.\u0022 The term is derived from a section of California law that allows the involuntary confinement of a person believed by authorities to be a danger to themselves or others, but most Skid Row residents read it as a kind of math: Once you\u0027ve crossed the halfway mark—51 percent insane—you\u0027ve reached the point of no return. \u000A\u000ABut often people do come back to themselves. The bad news is that Skid Row is still there, waiting for them. The missions that trade soup for souls; the \u0022zero tolerance\u0022 policing that denies the homeless their humanity, much less their citizenship; the tents and cardboard that for so many, even the sober and the sane, are the only form of housing. And the drugs, of course, the temptation of self-medication that nobody with a roof over their heads should ever dismiss as easily denied.\u000A\u000A\u0022End of the day,\u0022 a resident-turned-organizer called General Jeff told me one night while we stood on a corner, \u0022it\u0027s all death.\u0022 We were watching ambulances. There are always ambulances. \u0022You see the ambulances come and go,\u0022 he said. \u0022They\u0027re our friends. They pick up the bodies, the dead ones and the dying ones and all those that haven\u0027t quite gotten there.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Those that haven\u0027t quite gotten there.\u0022 That pretty much expresses what it means to be alive. Which is important to remember on Skid Row, surrounded by suffering. You\u0027re also surrounded by life—exceptionally resilient life, people who manage to survive and to help each other survive the most trying of fates. The odds are always against them, far worse than 51/50. And yet there they are. The city wishes they weren\u0027t, but there they are: Still human.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMecca\u000A\u000AAfrica\u0027s corner was actually in the middle of San Pedro, halfway between Fifth Street and Sixth. It\u0027s called a corner because the block is interrupted there by a wide driveway that leads into the underground parking garage of the Union Rescue Mission. Across the driveway, there\u0027s a street level storage garage that used to house a store. The shopkeeper was a woman named Mecca Harper. Mecca said she used to have a house with a lawn, and a job as a school bus driver, and a family, now grown. She also had a temper, and she took a misdemeanor from time to time, and one thing led to another until she lost the job and left the house and moved to Skid Row. \u0022I was a thug,\u0022 she says. She does a little swagger, swinging her shoulders. \u0022Gangsta,\u0022 she says, cackling. Says she used to favor fatigues. Now she likes flowing scarves and jewelry, symbols of Christ and Judaism and Islam and Buddhism. \u0022God take the thugs,\u0022 she says.  \u000A\u000AMecca knows almost everybody. A tiny, weathered Asian woman called Asian Persuasion grins toothlessly at Mecca and promises her she hasn\u0027t been selling her body lately. A giant Latino former gangbanger called Brain, his neck, face, and bare skull covered with ink, flicks little smiles in her direction; full 51/50, but when he sits by Mecca\u0027s store his monologues simmer instead of boil. A woman named Veronica begins tripping out right on the spot where Africa was killed, twirling just like he did, until Mecca walks into the whirling arms and whispers to her, nose to nose, and Veronica settles, and thanks Miss Mecca.  \u000A\u000AWhen Charly moved there last fall, he told Mecca she should know he\u0027d been in a mental institution. Ten years. \u0022Hey, baby,\u0022 Mecca told him. \u0022That\u0027s your story.\u0022 Nobody has to bring a past to Skid Row if they don\u0027t want to. So Charly left it behind. He never said his name. Somebody—might\u0027ve been Mecca—named him Africa, because that was where he was from. \u0022Like an African ambassador,\u0022 one man told me. Dignified. \u0022If he hear a disturbance inside the store,\u0022 says Mecca, \u0022he\u0027ll peek around with his hands together as if he was praying and bow his head and ask if everything ok. He had manners.\u0022  \u000A\u000AWhat does \u0022manners\u0022 mean on Skid Row? Same as anywhere else, with a little more caution: Respecting space. Charly picked his spot under the tree in part because it gave him some distance. Other residents camped along the red wall of the Union Rescue Mission, but every so often security would shuffle them along. Charly didn\u0027t want to be shuffled. He was the first to put his tent on that corner, but others followed. That happened easiest if he\u0027d invited you, like his friend Juju.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AJuju #1\u000A\u000ALate one night Juju and another friend of Charly\u0027s, James, and I sat on the sidewalk looking at Charly\u0027s tree. Juju was holding back tears. James said that after Africa died he had to hold Juju back, lest Juju do something foolish and also be taken by the man with eight arms—by which James meant the four police officers who\u0027d held Charly down. \u0022Vengeance is not ours,\u0022 James said, and the two men sparked up some spice, and for a while their fear subsided. \u000A\u000AThe next time I talked with Juju it was after midnight, a little party at Mecca\u0027s. Every night was a little party at Mecca\u0027s, the garage door rolled open and people dropping in for a blessing or to buy a loosie or a beer. Sometimes people came there to cool out—Mecca would let someone having a bad time sit quietly back by the bathroom. Sometimes to sing or to rap. Mecca\u0027s Bible was always on hand, and some nights a stoop-backed homeless rabbi with a black hat and tzitzit would cane his way in around one or two in the morning to discuss what he could recall of the Zohar. Juju came to talk about Charly. He told me everything he could remember—mostly just their smoking days, but also about the time he lost his tent and Africa let Juju enter his sanctuary; and about how sometimes they\u0027d get into fights like roommates, \u0022over a sock\u0022; and about what he called Africa\u0027s \u0022innocence.\u0022 Africa lacked cunning, he said. He let himself feel indignation. Juju had liked that. Being with Africa had let him feel a little indignation, too. Juju needed it, he said, because he\u0027d been a man once, too.  \u000A\u000AA good student back home in Baton Rouge, he said, and a good football player, but not good enough. No scholarship. So he\u0027d gone army. And he\u0027d been a good soldier, too. He said he\u0027d made it to E-6—staff sergeant—before he left to study for the ministry at Moody Bible Institute. Then—he couldn\u0027t explain. \u0022Walkabout,\u0022 he said. That was around a dozen years ago. He\u0027s still walking, a shambling chassis, marinated too long in his juices, eyes red and beard patchy and what was evidently once a powerful frame gone slack like he\u0027d lost his stuffing. That\u0027s what he liked about Africa. The man hadn\u0027t lost his stuffing.\u000A\u000AWe wandered out into the night together, and together we did our best to recall the soliloquy from Macbeth, that 27 years ago—we\u0027re the same age—we\u0027d both had to memorize in high school. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. But we could only get so far, all our yesterdays, before Juju spotted a dude on San Julian who could help him with a little something, and he promised we\u0027d figure out the rest at a rally for Africa the next morning.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AJuju #2\u000A\u000AThe rally was in the street in front of Charly\u0027s tree. Activists, local and imported, singing: \u0022Can\u0027t kill Africa,\u0022 driving the slogan up and down the scale around the work of a couple of street drummers. Juju had made it, just barely. He was against the wall. Sitting, listing, his pants half off his hips and soaked at the crotch because he was too wasted to walk the ten steps to the pissing nook under the cross. You do what you can. What Juju could do for Africa was stay conscious. Just barely. He\u0027d puked on the sidewalk beside him. A thin yellow pool. He was crying. He wanted to tell me something. With the drums I couldn\u0027t hear him. He wanted me to sit down. There was the yellow pool. In front of him was some cardboard, and he reached for it, and he put the cardboard over the bile. Manners. He looked up at me with his face shining in the sun, sweat and tears. I sat down. He leaned into me, tried to say something. I couldn\u0027t tell you what it was.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ALaru\u000A\u000ALaru Jay Curls left Minneapolis for California. To get a fresh start. He\u0027d lived there as a boy. Things had gone wrong in Minneapolis. He\u0027d gone there for a fresh start, too, after Topeka. At first it\u0027d worked. He and his girlfriend, K\u0027Sauna Raimey, got an apartment, But Laru was smoking crack. Not paying his share. His share came from a benefit. He was diagnosed, K\u0027Sauna believes -- a mental illness -- but he hid it from her. He was a smart guy. Well-spoken.\u0022 He was charming. He stepped up. A religious man. Believed in giving people chances. Took care of his cousins.  Knew a lot about law. Never long in prison. But he started using more drugs and they couldn\u0027t cover rent and then they were on the street, or in motels, or in sleeping rooms, and he used more drugs, and his mental illness started to show in the third year of their relationship, and although he didn\u0027t want anything to do with cops, one night he called 911, over and over, until they came, and he wouldn\u0027t answer the door, so they kicked it down, which is when K\u0027Sauna woke up. That\u0027s when she said, \u0022This man is crazy.\u0022 They took Laru to the psych ward. She had their baby girl, Imala, in July. He was scarce. In October, he said he was going to California. A fresh start. He was going to send for them. \u000A\u000ABefore his check was divided: drugs, rent, utilities, food. There was a limit to his addiction. Now it\u0027s not divided. Just drugs. He was coherent on the phone but he was slipping. In February, his mother died. His mother died and his father was dying, and a month later, after Africa died, his sister died, too, and even by February he was thinking he was all alone. He was thinking about getting high. But even when he was high he was thinking about K\u0027Sauna. That\u0027s how I know her name: He was smoking meth rolled into a blunt and talking about Africa and the Holy Ghost and the angel of death, and then he said \u0022K\u0027Sauna.\u0022 He said a number. I think he wanted me to call her. She wants him to call her. \u0022Tell him to please call.\u0022 She has an apartment. Her and Imala. I hear Imala crying. K\u0027Sauna has to go. If he called she would tell him to come home. \u0022Tell him. Tell him to please call.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AJared\u000A\u000A\u0022My name is Jared,\u0022 he says. \u0022You know, like the Subway guy?\u0022 He\u0027s a \u0022spice pet\u0022—an aide, in the most generous sense, to the dealers on Spice Row, the north side of San Pedro between Fifth and Sixth. Crack, heroin, meth, and spice. $5, $10. Also, loosies, a buck a cigarette. The dealers are black; spice pets are white. The dealers are \u0022affiliated\u0022—in the most generous sense—with the gangs of their youth, before they came to Skid Row. Heavy men who sit in office chairs on the street and nod at the addicts, serviced by spice pets like Jared, who is paid in kind. \u000A\u000AJared wants to show me his Facebook page. \u0022Jared Miller.\u0022 There are a lot of them. We scroll and scroll. He can\u0027t find himself. I give him my phone. He signs in. \u0022There I am,\u0022 he says. He smiles. There he is. A little boy. Jared\u0027s son, four-years-old, for whom on his left forearm Jared carries a tattoo of a bird on a slender branch. \u0022Because he can\u0027t fly yet,\u0022 says Jared, cradling the phone with its picture close to his eyes. \u000A\u000A\u0022This is his mom,\u0022 Jared says, pointing to a crisp young couple. \u0022Before the drugs, you know. And everything.\u0022 She\u0027s pretty. He was, too, muscular and rosy and bright-eyed, a straight-backed young man. There\u0027s a tuxedo. (I think; I scroll, and I scroll, but now I can\u0027t find him.) There\u0027s a buzz cut man with color in his cheeks and a baby in his arms, there\u0027s, Jared, crouching with his boy, in a yard in sun at an angle, early morning or maybe setting, with his girl, his child, his future. \u000A\u000A\u0022I started in the army,\u0022 he says. Drugs, he means. One of the dealers snaps at him. Spice pet has an errand. Spice pet can\u0027t find his shoes. They\u0027re right in front of him. He keeps looking. \u0022I don\u0027t have them,\u0022 he says to no one. He doesn\u0027t have much of anything, except the birds on his arm – \u0022That\u0027s my son,\u0022 he says, \u0022those two are for my mom and my dad\u0022 – and the words between his shoulders. \u0022A song of David,\u0022 I say. He knows. He recites the words. A song of Jared. \u0022I-will-rescue-those-who-love-me.\u0022 He turns and spreads his shoulders, murmuring his psalm.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000APastor Cue\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s church or a preacher or a Holy Ghost on every corner in Skid Row, and in the weeks after Africa died he became a kind of scripture: Every sermon a eulogy, a lament, a call to arms. Friday night, the corner of Wall and Winston on the edge of the Toy District, trash drifting up the curb like sea foam. Two skinny wings of folding chairs, spotlights tied to street signs, a congregation of mostly Asian and white suburbanites who drive into the city for grit with their gospel, and an amen corner of three middle-aged black women. Pastor Cue Jn-marie preaches from a tablet in front of a steel curtain, one of many; the neighborhood\u0027s toy wholesalers are bunkered shut for the night, which belongs to street people, and to Pastor Cue. He begins quietly, adjusting his glasses and his ball cap – ROW, as in Skid – but soon he begins pacing. Stretching. He doesn\u0027t yet own the corner or the crowd. Seems like he\u0027s not sure if he wants to. As if maybe he resents them a little. Resents himself a little, part of him thinking maybe he\u0027s playing the fool. Then he strips off his hoodie to reveal a tight gray T: CAN\u0027T KILL AFRICA. Now he starts to growl, not for his little suburban flock but at them. \u0022Notice,\u0022 preaches Cue, working on Acts, chapter 12, \u0022the people followed the execution.\u0022 He means Christ\u0027s crucifixion. \u0022They endorsed it! The general public endorsed the execution and they endorsed putting Peter in jail. I don\u0027t want you to miss that!\u0022 The crowd amens. A white woman in heels raises her open hands and dips her head in sorrow. Biblical martyrdom, she\u0027s all about it. But Cue isn\u0027t talking history. He\u0027s talking right now. Peter\u0027s in jail? So\u0027s Trishawn Carey, the woman who was the most immediate witness to Africa\u0027s killing. She picked up an officer\u0027s nightstick during the scuffle and for that she\u0027s in jail. \u0022And nobody is raising their voices in outrage that you would have a woman and they trying to give her life in prison!\u0022 Now the only amens come from the three black women in the front row. \u0022And she\u0027s mentally ill,\u0022 says Cue, voice dropping. \u0022She live on Skid Row. So she got a million dollar bail.\u0022 A million dollar bail! says one of the black women. Can we go get her out? It\u0027s not a question, it\u0027s a kind of prayer. Cue ramps up: \u0022I really wanna cuss right now!\u0022 The white woman in evening wear looks pained. \u0022A million dollar bail!\u0022 Cue hollers. \u0022You don\u0027t give some killers that kind of bail!\u0022 That\u0027s right! says the amen corner. Cue goes quiet. \u0022We don\u0027t see it. Because we want to be comfortable.\u0022 Then, to the suburbanites, almost mumbling now: \u0022Y\u0027all ain\u0027t gotta come back.\u0022 Go ahead, murmurs the amen corner, that\u0027s right. He pauses, as if to consider. Then he balls his shoulders and flexes full-on, the pose body builders call the crab, neck veins popping, and he roars: \u0022THEY WANTED TO KEEP THEIR RELIGIOUS RI-TU-AL!\u0022 The \u0022they\u0022 of Acts are the Jews. Cue means his congregation. He means anybody who doesn\u0027t feel–as he does, every day--like burning something down. \u0022BUT THEY WOULD MURDER SOMEBODY, AND THEY WOULD FRAME SOMEBODY, IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR RELIGIOUS CELEBRATION.\u0022 Religious celebration? That\u0027s the Pharisees. Cue means gentrification, the \u0022loft people,\u0022 the police who \u0022contain\u0022 the homeless in their name. \u0022And they killed Jesus when he called them on that type of behavior!\u0022 Jesus? Cue means Africa. How did Africa call anybody on anything? By being alive. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ATelepathic\u000A\u000ASays he\u0027s called Telepathic. Says he knows what I\u0027m thinking. Says his real name is Virgil. \u0022Like the Inferno.\u0022 He means like Dante. Dante\u0027s Inferno, into which the shade of the poet Virgil is Dante\u0027s guide. \u000A\u000AVirgil is a sweeper. He sweeps Africa\u0027s memorial clean. \u0022Where\u0027d you get the broom?\u0022 I ask. \u0022Where does anybody get a broom?\u0022 he asks. He doesn\u0027t know the answer. \u000A\u000AHe edges the broom around the cardboard angel wings, around the books left out for the dead man. Short sharp strokes, as precise as his clipped words. \u000A\u000AThe sidewalk is clean. As clean as it can be. Virgil throws the broom down on the ground and walks into the road.\u000A\u000ABrain—the 51/50 gangbanger, tattoos crawling round his shaved skull—darts out to retrieve it. A broom! Where does anybody get a broom? Brain knows the answer. He takes it back to the wall and sits, tucks the broom away behind him and then retrieves it: Brain counts the bristles.",

data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.0">I went to Skid Row to report the life and death of Charly &quot;Africa&quot; Keunang, an unarmed homeless man held down and then shot six times by Los Angeles police officers. <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/skid-row-police-shooting-charly-keunang">Charly was killed</a> beneath the fig tree in the background of the photograph below. That was where he lived before they killed him, too, so I made it the heart of my reporting. I went to ask questions about Charly; but to do so I had to get to know the people of whom I was asking these questions, and in the process I was fortunate enough to encounter many lives as rich and complex and worth knowing as Charly&apos;s. Here are a few of them. Not a collective portrait of Skid Row, the densest homeless district in the United States&#x2014;that would require ten times as many stories just to begin&#x2014;but a few facets: respect, generosity, courage; grief, addiction, insanity. </p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.1">On Skid Row, someone who is thought to be especially mentally ill is referred to as &quot;fifty-one fifty.&quot; The term is derived from a section of California law that allows the involuntary confinement of a person believed by authorities to be a danger to themselves or others, but most Skid Row residents read it as a kind of math: Once you&apos;ve crossed the halfway mark&#x2014;51 percent insane&#x2014;you&apos;ve reached the point of no return. </p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.2">But often people do come back to themselves. The bad news is that Skid Row is still there, waiting for them. The missions that trade soup for souls; the &quot;zero tolerance&quot; policing that denies the homeless their humanity, much less their citizenship; the tents and cardboard that for so many, even the sober and the sane, are the only form of housing. And the drugs, of course, the temptation of self-medication that nobody with a roof over their heads should ever dismiss as easily denied.</p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.3">&quot;End of the day,&quot; a resident-turned-organizer called General Jeff told me one night while we stood on a corner, &quot;it&apos;s all death.&quot; We were watching ambulances. There are always ambulances. &quot;You see the ambulances come and go,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;re our friends. They pick up the bodies, the dead ones and the dying ones and all those that haven&apos;t quite gotten there.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.5">&quot;Those that haven&apos;t quite gotten there.&quot; That pretty much expresses what it means to be alive. Which is important to remember on Skid Row, surrounded by suffering. You&apos;re also surrounded by life&#x2014;exceptionally resilient life, people who manage to survive and to help each other survive the most trying of fates. The odds are always against them, far worse than 51/50. And yet there they are. The city wishes they weren&apos;t, but there they are: Still human.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.6"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a9177dae529ee176ccc8a2/master/w_806/Skid-Row-4.jpg" alt="Skid-Row-4.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;t=Skid-Row-4.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;t=Skid-Row-4.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a9177dae529ee176ccc8a2%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSkid-Row-4.jpg&amp;description=Skid-Row-4.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a9177dae529ee176ccc8a2%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSkid-Row-4.jpg&amp;description=Skid-Row-4.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Mecca</strong></p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.8">Africa&apos;s corner was actually in the middle of San Pedro, halfway between Fifth Street and Sixth. It&apos;s called a corner because the block is interrupted there by a wide driveway that leads into the underground parking garage of the Union Rescue Mission. Across the driveway, there&apos;s a street level storage garage that used to house a store. The shopkeeper was a woman named Mecca Harper. Mecca said she used to have a house with a lawn, and a job as a school bus driver, and a family, now grown. She also had a temper, and she took a misdemeanor from time to time, and one thing led to another until she lost the job and left the house and moved to Skid Row. &quot;I was a thug,&quot; she says. She does a little swagger, swinging her shoulders. &quot;Gangsta,&quot; she says, cackling. Says she used to favor fatigues. Now she likes flowing scarves and jewelry, symbols of Christ and Judaism and Islam and Buddhism. &quot;God take the thugs,&quot; she says.  </p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.9">Mecca knows almost everybody. A tiny, weathered Asian woman called Asian Persuasion grins toothlessly at Mecca and promises her she hasn&apos;t been selling her body lately. A giant Latino former gangbanger called Brain, his neck, face, and bare skull covered with ink, flicks little smiles in her direction; full 51/50, but when he sits by Mecca&apos;s store his monologues simmer instead of boil. A woman named Veronica begins tripping out right on the spot where Africa was killed, twirling just like he did, until Mecca walks into the whirling arms and whispers to her, nose to nose, and Veronica settles, and thanks Miss Mecca.  </p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.a">When Charly moved there last fall, he told Mecca she should know he&apos;d been in a mental institution. Ten years. &quot;Hey, baby,&quot; Mecca told him. &quot;That&apos;s your story.&quot; Nobody has to bring a past to Skid Row if they don&apos;t want to. So Charly left it behind. He never said his name. Somebody&#x2014;might&apos;ve been Mecca&#x2014;named him Africa, because that was where he was from. &quot;Like an African ambassador,&quot; one man told me. Dignified. &quot;If he hear a disturbance inside the store,&quot; says Mecca, &quot;he&apos;ll peek around with his hands together as if he was praying and bow his head and ask if everything ok. He had <em>manners</em>.&quot;  </p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.b">What does &quot;manners&quot; mean on Skid Row? Same as anywhere else, with a little more caution: Respecting space. Charly picked his spot under the tree in part because it gave him some distance. Other residents camped along the red wall of the Union Rescue Mission, but every so often security would shuffle them along. Charly didn&apos;t want to be shuffled. He was the first to put his tent on that corner, but others followed. That happened easiest if he&apos;d invited you, like his friend Juju.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.c"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55ad57b1962900e47cf10a34/master/w_806/Skid-Row Standing.jpeg" alt="Skid-Row Standing.jpeg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;t=Skid-Row%20Standing.jpeg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;t=Skid-Row%20Standing.jpeg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55ad57b1962900e47cf10a34%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSkid-Row%20Standing.jpeg&amp;description=Skid-Row%20Standing.jpeg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55ad57b1962900e47cf10a34%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSkid-Row%20Standing.jpeg&amp;description=Skid-Row%20Standing.jpeg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Juju #1</strong></p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.e">Late one night Juju and another friend of Charly&apos;s, James, and I sat on the sidewalk looking at Charly&apos;s tree. Juju was holding back tears. James said that after Africa died he had to hold Juju back, lest Juju do something foolish and also be taken by the man with eight arms&#x2014;by which James meant the four police officers who&apos;d held Charly down. &quot;Vengeance is not ours,&quot; James said, and the two men sparked up some spice, and for a while their fear subsided. </p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.f">The next time I talked with Juju it was after midnight, a little party at Mecca&apos;s. Every night was a little party at Mecca&apos;s, the garage door rolled open and people dropping in for a blessing or to buy a loosie or a beer. Sometimes people came there to cool out&#x2014;Mecca would let someone having a bad time sit quietly back by the bathroom. Sometimes to sing or to rap. Mecca&apos;s Bible was always on hand, and some nights a stoop-backed homeless rabbi with a black hat and tzitzit would cane his way in around one or two in the morning to discuss what he could recall of the Zohar. Juju came to talk about Charly. He told me everything he could remember&#x2014;mostly just their smoking days, but also about the time he lost his tent and Africa let Juju enter his sanctuary; and about how sometimes they&apos;d get into fights like roommates, &quot;over a sock&quot;; and about what he called Africa&apos;s &quot;innocence.&quot; Africa lacked cunning, he said. He let himself feel indignation. Juju had liked that. Being with Africa had let him feel a little indignation, too. Juju needed it, he said, because he&apos;d been a man once, too.  </p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.g">A good student back home in Baton Rouge, he said, and a good football player, but not good enough. No scholarship. So he&apos;d gone army. And he&apos;d been a good soldier, too.

That was around a dozen years ago. He&apos;s still walking, a shambling chassis, marinated too long in his juices, eyes red and beard patchy and what was evidently once a powerful frame gone slack like he&apos;d lost his stuffing.

He was against the wall. Sitting, listing, his pants half off his hips and soaked at the crotch because he was too wasted to walk the ten steps to the pissing nook under the cross. You do what you can. What Juju could do for Africa was stay conscious. Just barely. He&apos;d puked on the sidewalk beside him. A thin yellow pool. He was crying. He wanted to tell me something. With the drums I couldn&apos;t hear him. He wanted me to sit down. There was the yellow pool. In front of him was some cardboard, and he reached for it, and he put the cardboard over the bile. Manners. He looked up at me with his face shining in the sun, sweat and tears. I sat down. He leaned into me, tried to say something.

To get a fresh start. He&apos;d lived there as a boy. Things had gone wrong in Minneapolis. He&apos;d gone there for a fresh start, too, after Topeka. At first it&apos;d worked. He and his girlfriend, K&apos;Sauna Raimey, got an apartment, But Laru was smoking crack. Not paying his share. His share came from a benefit. He was diagnosed, K&apos;Sauna believes -- a mental illness -- but he hid it from her. He was a smart guy. Well-spoken.&quot; He was charming. He stepped up. A religious man. Believed in giving people chances. Took care of his cousins.  Knew a lot about law. Never long in prison. But he started using more drugs and they couldn&apos;t cover rent and then they were on the street, or in motels, or in sleeping rooms, and he used more drugs, and his mental illness started to show in the third year of their relationship, and although he didn&apos;t want anything to do with cops, one night he called 911, over and over, until they came, and he wouldn&apos;t answer the door, so they kicked it down, which is when K&apos;Sauna woke up. That&apos;s when she said, &quot;This man is crazy.&quot; They took Laru to the psych ward. She had their baby girl, Imala, in July. He was scarce. In October, he said he was going to California. A fresh start. He was going to send for them. </p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.o">Before his check was divided: drugs, rent, utilities, food. There was a limit to his addiction. Now it&apos;s not divided. Just drugs. He was coherent on the phone but he was slipping. In February, his mother died. His mother died and his father was dying, and a month later, after Africa died, his sister died, too, and even by February he was thinking he was all alone. He was thinking about getting high. But even when he was high he was thinking about K&apos;Sauna. That&apos;s how I know her name: He was smoking meth rolled into a blunt and talking about Africa and the Holy Ghost and the angel of death, and then he said &quot;K&apos;Sauna.&quot; He said a number. I think he wanted me to call her. She wants him to call her. &quot;Tell him to please call.&quot; She has an apartment. Her and Imala. I hear Imala crying. K&apos;Sauna has to go.

Friday night, the corner of Wall and Winston on the edge of the Toy District, trash drifting up the curb like sea foam. Two skinny wings of folding chairs, spotlights tied to street signs, a congregation of mostly Asian and white suburbanites who drive into the city for grit with their gospel, and an amen corner of three middle-aged black women. Pastor Cue Jn-marie preaches from a tablet in front of a steel curtain, one of many; the neighborhood&apos;s toy wholesalers are bunkered shut for the night, which belongs to street people, and to Pastor Cue. He begins quietly, adjusting his glasses and his ball cap &#x2013; ROW, as in Skid &#x2013; but soon he begins pacing. Stretching. He doesn&apos;t yet own the corner or the crowd. Seems like he&apos;s not sure if he wants to. As if maybe he resents them a little. Resents himself a little, part of him thinking maybe he&apos;s playing the fool.&#xA0;Then he strips off his hoodie to reveal a tight gray T: CAN&apos;T KILL AFRICA. Now he starts to growl, not for his little suburban flock but at them. &quot;Notice,&quot; preaches Cue, working on Acts, chapter 12, &quot;<em>the people</em>&#xA0;followed the execution.&quot; He means Christ&apos;s crucifixion. &quot;They endorsed it! The general public endorsed the execution and they endorsed putting Peter in jail. I don&apos;t want you to miss that!&quot; The crowd amens. A white woman in heels raises her open hands and dips her head in sorrow.&#xA0;Biblical martyrdom, she&apos;s all about it. But Cue isn&apos;t talking history. He&apos;s talking right now. Peter&apos;s in jail? So&apos;s Trishawn Carey, the woman who was the most immediate witness to Africa&apos;s killing. She picked up an officer&apos;s nightstick during the scuffle and for that she&apos;s in jail. &quot;And nobody is raising their voices in&#xA0;<em>outrage</em>&#xA0;that you would have a&#xA0;<em>woman</em>&#xA0;and they trying to give her&#xA0;<em>life</em>&#xA0;in prison!&quot; Now the only&#xA0;amens&#xA0;come from the three black women in the front row.&#xA0;&quot;And she&apos;s mentally ill,&quot; says Cue, voice dropping. &quot;She live on Skid Row. So she got a million dollar bail.&quot;&#xA0;<em>A million dollar bail!</em>&#xA0;says one of the black women.&#xA0;<em>Can we go get her out?</em>&#xA0;It&apos;s not a question, it&apos;s a kind of prayer. Cue ramps up: &quot;I really wanna cuss right now!&quot; The white woman in evening wear looks pained. &quot;A million dollar bail!&quot; Cue hollers. &quot;You don&apos;t give some&#xA0;<em>killers</em>&#xA0;that kind of bail!&quot;&#xA0;<em>That&apos;s right!</em>&#xA0;says the amen corner.&#xA0;Cue goes quiet.&#xA0;&quot;We don&apos;t see it. Because we want to be&#xA0;<em>comfortable</em>.&quot; Then, to the suburbanites, almost mumbling now: &quot;Y&apos;all ain&apos;t gotta come back.&quot;&#xA0;<em>Go ahead</em>, murmurs the amen corner,&#xA0;<em>that&apos;s right</em>.&#xA0;He pauses, as if to consider. Then he balls his shoulders and flexes full-on, the pose body builders call the crab, neck veins popping, and he roars: &quot;THEY WANTED TO KEEP THEIR RELIGIOUS RI-TU-AL!&quot; The &quot;they&quot; of Acts are the Jews. Cue means his congregation. He means anybody who doesn&apos;t feel&#x2013;as he does, every day--like burning something down.&#xA0;&quot;BUT THEY WOULD MURDER SOMEBODY, AND THEY WOULD FRAME SOMEBODY, IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR RELIGIOUS CELEBRATION.&quot; Religious celebration? That&apos;s the Pharisees. Cue means gentrification, the &quot;loft people,&quot; the police who &quot;contain&quot; the homeless in their name. &quot;<em>And they killed Jesus when he called them on that type of behavior!</em>&quot; Jesus? Cue means Africa. How did Africa call anybody on anything? By being alive.&#xA0;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.y"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a917804e6e4c4f31a47dee/master/w_806/Skid-Row-2.jpg" alt="Skid-Row-2.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;t=Skid-Row-2.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;t=Skid-Row-2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a917804e6e4c4f31a47dee%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSkid-Row-2.jpg&amp;description=Skid-Row-2.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fskid-row-for-ten-days-collective-portrait&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a917804e6e4c4f31a47dee%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FSkid-Row-2.jpg&amp;description=Skid-Row-2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>Telepathic</strong></p><p data-reactid=".u0s163ijuo.1.1.0.0.4.10">Says he&apos;s called Telepathic.
