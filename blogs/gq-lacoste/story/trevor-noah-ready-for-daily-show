  	    "articleBody": "Trevor Noah is in Irvine, California. Not even Los Angeles. Irvine. Forty grim miles south through strip-mall country and the Orange County suburbs, where Noah is doing a three-night, five-show stand-up comedy run here at the Irvine Improv, home to your host Friendly Frank and some upcoming Bob Saget shows. Noah is trying, without a lot of luck so far, to get a rhythm going with a roomful of suburbanites—grinding through a seventy-five-minute early-evening set, the first of two he\u0027s on the hook for tonight, like he\u0027s not about to start hosting The Daily Show in September. Like he\u0027s not arguably the most famous comedian in his native South Africa—in all of Africa, full stop—which he is and has been for the better part of a decade. Like he didn\u0027t just come here from the Met Ball in New York City, where he hung in the corner with Joel McHale and Seth Meyers, watching Rihanna sing and marveling at whatever his life has suddenly become. \u000A\u000AWhy is Trevor Noah in Irvine? Maybe because he\u0027s a workhorse who has spent large parts of the past decade in semi-depressing solitude on the road. Maybe because he\u0027s saying one last good-bye to the road and the solitude and the stage. Maybe because Irvine is not Los Angeles or New York or any other place where he has to be on—bright, shiny, new, ready for audiences one or two thousand times bigger than this one. Maybe because Irvine is not South Africa. \u000A\u000ALet\u0027s not talk about South Africa just yet. \u000A\u000ASet two goes better. It\u0027s dark outside now. Inside, everybody\u0027s laughing. American comics have learned to weigh down every joke with cement shoes of irony—that sleepy, self-aware delivery, that vaguely self-hating stage presence. But Trevor Noah comes from a place where audiences barely understand what stand-up comedy even is. So he\u0027s up there working. He does a bit about how cell phones are making us all hunchbacked ape-people, and when he does the joke, you can see it, the reverse march of progress, proud man bent over his phone, shrinking back down to monkey. He\u0027s moving all over the stage. Mostly he\u0027s doing the same material from his first set—observational bits about Ebola in Africa and freeway culture in Los Angeles—but then he goes rogue and starts in on new stuff, high-degree-of-difficulty jokes about the senseless deaths of Walter Scott and Eric Garner and the charming, genteel bigotry of the American South (\u0022racism with a smile and a tip of the hat\u0022). Some of the things he\u0027s talking about only happened a month ago, and they\u0027re still beyond sad and/or fucked-up, but he\u0027s making us all wince and laugh in the precise wince/laugh ratio you\u0027d want from a comic talking about police-involved killings.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAfterward he\u0027s backstage, sprawled out on a couch in weary content, and a few other comics crowd into the little room. He\u0027s got the well-proportioned features of the television host he\u0027s about to become. His smile is like something you might see during a job interview. Everybody\u0027s showing him the kind of deference reserved for someone who is supposed to be the next Jon Stewart. By the door is a tired-looking comedian named Gene Pompa, whom Noah knows from his road days, and Pompa soon starts in on Stewart, who advertised himself as this lightning rod of enlightenment but was in fact a white guy with a bunch of white boys writing for him, and how enlightened is that, really? Pompa says he\u0027s excited for Noah to take over, because he\u0027s going to do comedy that\u0027s authentically \u0022ethnic.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a little silence. Then Trevor Noah smiles politely and begins to explain himself.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ANoah\u0027s earliest comedy bits were autobiographical, and to a degree, they still are—his life has been so strange and so singular that he can relate it more or less as it happened and watch people laugh. Not that much of it was funny at the time. But Noah learned a long time ago that the only tolerable way to tell his story, even to himself, was as a joke. If you want to understand his comedy—the fundamental apartness of it, the way it comes from the outside looking in—you need to understand this first. \u000A\u000A\u0022My family is black on my mom\u0027s side, white on my father\u0027s side,\u0022 Noah says over lunch one day. \u0022Then there\u0027s me.\u0022 He was a mixed-race kid in apartheid South Africa, which is to say his birth was evidence of a crime; one early Noah routine was about how he learned to tell kids in his neighborhood that he was an albino, an unlikely story that was still more plausible than the truth. His parents were never truly together, and on the occasions that Noah\u0027s mother visited his father after Noah was born, she did so dressed as a maid. \u0022So I would see my dad\u0027s life, but it\u0027s like visiting Disney World. Even though you visit Disney World, you don\u0027t go, ‘That\u0027s how life is.\u0027 You go, ‘No, I live my normal life, and Disney World exists.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ANoah\u0027s normal life was in the township of Soweto, a bunch of relatives in a two-room house. \u0022All the adults slept in one room, all the kids slept in the other room.\u0022 This is the part of the story that Noah has since told many times, often for laughs. \u0022In the streets, my father couldn\u0027t walk with us,\u0022 went one routine. \u0022He would walk on the other side of the road and wave at me—like a creepy pedophile.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut what happened next is something Noah has barely talked about at all. \u000A\u000AAfter the end of apartheid in 1994, Noah\u0027s father moved away, to Cape Town, and his mother—Noah\u0027s partner in mischief, a voluble and funny woman who was fiercely protective of her only child—meanwhile had married another man. Noah was only 9 or 10, but even then he regarded his new stepfather with suspicion. \u0022I just saw something behind the smile, you know? But as a kid, people don\u0027t take you seriously—they\u0027re like, ‘Hey, calm down. Everyone doesn\u0027t like their stepdad.\u0027 \u0022 The man moved in, and so commenced a violent and unhappy time in Noah\u0027s life. \u0022Over time, his true colors came out. He was an alcoholic; he was an extremely angry drunk person, very abusive.\u0022 \u000A\u000AHis mother and stepfather had two children together, Noah\u0027s little brothers, even as his stepfather\u0027s abuse became steadily worse. \u0022He was sporadically abusive. I could count the abuse—in a twelve-year marriage, I could say, three times, probably. Three or four times. But the scale at which the abuse—like, the first time was slaps, a few slaps. The second time was slaps that turned into punches. The third time was basically using a blunt object or whatever.\u0022 Noah finally moved out of the house when he was 17. His mother stuck it out, until she didn\u0027t, leaving with Noah\u0027s brothers a few years later.\u000A\u000ABy then Noah was living on his own in a cockroach-infested apartment. He was 22 and began telling jokes in his spare time, dodging an older generation of angry white comics who thought guys like Noah were arrogant just for getting onstage, let alone for doing so and then talking about apartheid or their own complex racial identities, as Noah did. \u0022A lot of the white comedians were feeling aggrieved. They were like, ‘Why are the black comedians getting more laughs?\u0027 And then they started hating on the fact that, I guess, we had experiences, we had a culture, we weren\u0027t just talking about the weather or escalators. We were going, ‘This happened with my family,\u0027 and, ‘Let me tell you about the time I got arrested by the cops.\u0027 We had experience; we had texture; we had layers; we had life.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere was no way to get paid for the work, really, but it led to things, being onstage—television work, mostly. By 24 he was hosting the South African Film and Television Awards, \u0022and then I was hosting our version of the Grammys, basically.\u0022 Suddenly he was famous, if not necessarily for comedy, but for just being ubiquitous, around. Soon, because he finally could, he leveraged that fame into a book and a stand-up special, The Daywalker, among the first of its kind in South Africa. \u000A\u000AOne night, while he was preparing for The Daywalker, his phone rang. \u0022It was funny in hindsight, because it was my little brother, and he\u0027s like, ‘Hey, Trevor.\u0027 I\u0027m like, ‘Hey, what\u0027s up?\u0027 He\u0027s like, ‘Are you busy?\u0027 I\u0027m like, ‘No, I\u0027m sort of sleeping. What\u0027s going on?\u0027 He\u0027s like, ‘Mom\u0027s just been shot.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ANoah relates this story in an even tone, here in this brightly colored restaurant in the suburban bouncy castle that is Irvine, California, and that somehow makes it even more heartbreaking, his steady, deliberate march through the details. His mother and his brothers had just come home from church. Since she\u0027d left Noah\u0027s stepfather, she\u0027d become engaged to another man, and when her ex-husband found out, he\u0027d returned with a gun. Noah\u0027s brothers—the man\u0027s own sons—pleaded with him to leave. Instead, \u0022he started shooting, and my brothers ran for their lives, and my mom ran as well, and my uncle, and everybody who was there at the house—everybody just ran for safety. My mom got shot, shot once in the torso, and another bullet went in her head. She got shot in the head, you know? And my brother—to this day, the hero—he grabbed my mom, threw her in the car, blood gushing everywhere, drove her to the hospital\u0022—a 15-year-old kid who\u0027d only learned to drive two or three months prior, racing his dying mother to the hospital, which is in the end what may have saved her life. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWhen Noah arrived, doctors told him it was a \u0022miracle\u0022 that his mother had survived—\u0022that\u0027s the word the doctor used, which doctors hate using, and I understand why. The bullet missed everything, went into the back of her head, missed her spine, missed all the nerves, everything, went through, didn\u0027t hit the brain, just went through the bottom, just under the brain, just smashed into her eye socket, which then deflected the bullet, and it came out of her nose.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere is a point to this story beyond the obvious, and for Noah the point is this: \u000A\u000ATwo days after it happened, Noah was by her bedside, crying. His mother asked him to stop. \u0022She says, ‘No, no. Please, look at the bright side. I\u0027m still here. Just be grateful that I\u0027m still here.\u0027 I\u0027m like, ‘Yeah, but still.\u0027 She says, ‘And on an even brighter side…look at my nose. I\u0027ve got half a nose now. So now you\u0027re officially the best-looking person in the family. There\u0027s no contest.\u0027 And then I start crying. Everyone\u0027s laughing and crying. You know? But that\u0027s who we were as people; that\u0027s who we\u0027ve always been.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere are platitudes about situations like this, laughing to keep from crying, whatever doesn\u0027t kill you making you stronger, etc. Comics often claim that the fat-nerd misery they\u0027ve experienced in life gives them license to tell jokes about whatever sensitive subject they want. But this point of view is not an abstraction, or a moral convenience, to Trevor Noah. It is a simple hard-earned fact. \u000A\u000A\u0022It was one of those turning moments in life where I was like, ‘You know what? No one can ever tell me that line of ‘There\u0027s nothing funny about X.\u0027 If you can\u0027t laugh, you have nothing.\u0022\u000A\u000ACall that a cliché. Tell that to Trevor Noah. \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhen Noah takes over The Daily Show on September 28, it will mark the completion of a rapid and disorienting transition at Comedy Central, which has spent the past couple of years turning the much beloved trio of Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, and John Oliver into two relative unknowns, Larry Wilmore and Trevor Noah. It\u0027s maybe the biggest gamble in late night since NBC hired Conan to replace David Letterman. The Daily Show! Probably the most beloved modern comedy institution this side of Saturday Night Live. And Comedy Central is turning it over to a 31-year-old kid who most Americans haven\u0027t even heard of. Ask Comedy Central president Michele Ganeless how she feels about this turn of events and she will not bother to spin you: \u0022I will not lie. Yes: I have moments of great anxiety.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe network had good reasons for choosing Noah, Ganeless says. \u0022He is a student of our culture. But he looks at it from a very different perspective.\u0022 Also, he is \u0022super, super funny.\u0022 Perhaps just as crucially, he is a generation removed from the older white men he\u0027s replacing. Noah \u0022really understands our audience, because he is one of them,\u0022 Ganeless says, which I take as her way of saying that Comedy Central would be happy to discover, or rediscover, a younger and more demographically appealing audience than the one that was aging in lockstep with Stewart. \u000A\u000AHis youth, his background, the outsider nature of his comedy—all of that made him an appealing choice to the network. But it\u0027s also where the risk comes in. Noah has been telling jokes for a decade now, but much of that time was spent in South Africa, where audiences lean broad, rather than in America, where we\u0027ve long since honed our taste toward hyper-specificity and knowingness. To date, neither has been Noah\u0027s strength. And The Daily Show, in particular, is a temple to this type of humor, panning through our broken politics and broken cable-news channels for subtle nuggets of comic gold. \u000A\u000ASoon after Comedy Central announced that it had hired Noah, the network found itself defending him after people discovered old jokes of his on Twitter that, to put it gently, did not quite land. \u0022Almost bumped a Jewish kid crossing the road. He didn\u0027t look b4 crossing but I still would hav felt so bad in my german car!\u0022 was one. \u0022‘Oh yeah the weekend. People are gonna get drunk &amp; think that I\u0027m sexy!\u0027 - fat chicks everywhere\u0022 was another. Many people found the tweets offensive. But maybe even more problematic, at least for Noah and Comedy Central, was that very few people found them even remotely funny. \u000A\u000ALess discussed but perhaps just as inflammatory was Noah\u0027s breakthrough performance in the United States, which came in 2012 on Jay Leno\u0027s Tonight Show. By then, The Daywalker had already made him a comedy icon in South Africa; he\u0027d hosted his own late-night talk show there, which he describes as \u0022a fusion between The Daily Show and The Tonight Show,\u0022 making it through two seasons before running out of worthy guests. \u0022You go, ‘Wow, we\u0027ve interviewed all twenty-six people who are famous enough right now, and there\u0027s literally no one else.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AIt was a moment when he could\u0027ve done more or less anything he\u0027d wanted, but it was also the moment when he began to feel South Africa closing in on him. So he decided to move to Pasadena, where a friend of his lived in this \u0022little white suburban world,\u0022 and do stand-up all around the country for American audiences who had absolutely no idea who he was. For two years he toured tiny clubs in places like Lexington, Kentucky, and Erie, Pennsylvania, living on the road, surviving on gas-station food.\u000A\u000AIt was a weird time. \u0022Depression is probably your closest companion on those travels,\u0022 Noah says bluntly. He estimates he made it to forty states in that time, more America than many Americans will ever see, moving through his adopted country like a ghost. \u0022You\u0027re people-sick. You\u0027re human-being-sick. You just want someone in your life. You want a friend. You want to know you exist.\u0022 It was after he\u0027d done that for a while that Leno called. \u000A\u000AThe Leno performance was a sort of proto-version of the first bits Noah would later do on The Daily Show: a quick-minded South African guy marveling at American culture and being astounded by what he finds. On Leno it\u0027s specifically African-American culture that he zooms in on—a culture, Noah says now, that he was always in awe of. \u0022In my world, honestly, we grew up idolizing black Americans.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut in the Leno routine, there\u0027s something weird and dissonant about the pronouns; watching it again recently, I felt myself cringe. Maybe you would\u0027ve needed to grow up here to understand how certain jokes about American black culture—about the names people choose, about the way people speak—have long served as a comic veil for unvarnished white racism.\u000A\u000ABut in 2012, Noah clearly didn\u0027t know that yet. \u0022I don\u0027t even really know where some of these ‘African\u0027 names come from,\u0022 he jokes at one point. \u0022There\u0027s so many consonants so close together! It\u0027s almost like they lose their minds with the Scrabble pieces while giving birth. Like, ‘What are we going to name her?! Oh snap—Tanequa!\u0027 \u0022 \u000A\u000ALater in the same bit, he says: \u0022I\u0027ve heard African-Americans, and oh, the way they speak, they pay no regard to punctuation whatsoever! Just cruise through sentences like poetry. I don\u0027t even understand half of it, but it sounds great.\u0022 Then he does an imitation of what he\u0027s talking about, and over his shoulder you can see Leno and that evening\u0027s guest, Glenn Close, dying, two older white folks bent over with laughter.\u000A\u000ANoah still defends this bit, but only to a point. \u0022I look back on it and I go, ‘Had I known, I would\u0027ve done it differently.\u0027 Because when you come from a different place, you don\u0027t realize the minefield you\u0027re walking into,\u0022 he says. \u0022I do know this: I continued doing the Leno bit after I\u0027d done it on Leno. But the way I did it slash would do it today is completely different. I\u0027ve now learned how to be emotionally aware of how people may use your joke in a negative way. And that\u0027s something that you\u0027re always trying to navigate in comedy. You know, Dave Chappelle talked about it as well—if you\u0027re not careful, someone can use your words to hurt somebody else.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe says he particularly regrets one joke in that routine that was addressed specifically to African-Americans. \u0022I said: ‘You\u0027re not African, but we play along.\u0027 \u0022 The problem was, \u0022I had given some people ammunition to oppress those who had already been oppressed.\u0022 Now he feels that he\u0027d taken the wrong side. \u0022I hadn\u0027t fully understood the African-American experience. I hadn\u0027t read the books; I hadn\u0027t met the people; I hadn\u0027t traveled the country.\u0022 \u000A\u000A\u0022I may not be American, but I am black,\u0022 Noah says simply. \u0022It\u0027s not like I had to learn how to be black.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000AIn Irvine, three years later, the pronouns had changed—when he talked about Eric Garner, or Mike Brown, or Walter Scott, or getting pulled over by Los Angeles cops, it was \u0022we\u0022 and \u0022us\u0022 and \u0022I,\u0022 not \u0022you\u0022 and \u0022they.\u0022 The jokes were considerably more deft—more funny, too. On the posthumous smearing of Walter Scott—who was shot in the back as he ran from police in South Carolina—by various news organizations, some of which made a point of bringing up an irrelevant 1987 assault-and-battery charge: \u0022What happened, did he punch this guy into the future?\u0022\u000A\u000AI ask Noah if he felt like he had to learn how to talk about this stuff. \u000A\u000A\u0022I may not be American, but I am black,\u0022 Noah says simply. \u0022It\u0027s not like I had to learn how to be black.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s still figuring out what The Daily Show will be, once they hand him the keys. \u0022I have a very vague picture of the show right now,\u0022 Noah says. \u0022It\u0027ll be like a face-lift. Because, don\u0027t get it twisted, I\u0027m a big fan of The Daily Show, and that\u0027s what it\u0027s still gonna be. It\u0027s still gonna be The Daily Show. It\u0027s the same way, when Fallon took over from Leno, it\u0027s still The Tonight Show.\u0022 \u000A\u000AI point out that Fallon has in fact completely changed The Tonight Show since taking over, turning a relatively staid talk show into a viral-video factory, and Noah agrees but says basically: The shift was natural and gradual, and he hopes to do the same thing. \u0022Just the mere fact that I\u0027m gonna be there in the chair changes a whole bunch of the show, you know?\u0022\u000A\u000AHe is, as he\u0027s always been, the unknown—so much of his comedy has depended on that, the fact that he doesn\u0027t look like the people in the audience, the fact that he doesn\u0027t come from where they come from. And while Comedy Central is clearly excited about the demographic possibilities of the new Daily Show—\u0022It is going to be really reflective of a millennial audience and a millennial point of view,\u0022 Ganeless says—you get the sense that for Noah, the challenge is more personal. It\u0027s about bringing us to him, not him to us; he\u0027ll conform, but only to a point. He\u0027s been winning over skeptical audiences his entire life—why stop now?  \u000A\u000AIn that respect, he says, the controversy that occurred after his hiring was necessary. \u0022A guy doesn\u0027t leave and another guy comes in and there\u0027s no backlash. That never, ever happens. When Michael B. Jordan got cast as the new Human Torch in Fantastic Four, there was backlash, because they were like, ‘How can this fictional character be a black man?\u0027 The new storm trooper from Star Wars, when he took his helmet off in the trailer, people lost their minds. ‘This is ridiculous. How can there be black people in space?\u0027 I didn\u0027t know what the backlash was gonna be, but I knew there was going to be backlash. The same thing when Larry Wilmore took over from Colbert: ‘Oh, this is never gonna work. This is horrible.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AIs it coincidental that every example you just gave is a black man?\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s a good question,\u0022 Noah says, and then repeats it again in that way you do when you\u0027re still waiting for an answer to arrive. \u0022Because there probably is something that plays into that, you know? I\u0027ve never considered it too much, but people are afraid of change.\u0022\u000A\u000ANoah is more worried about whether he can change fast enough. He has been a quick study all his life—by nature and by necessity. \u0022You show me half my jokes from even two years ago, three years ago—I hate them. Because you see, like, a young version of yourself. You\u0027re like, ‘Why would you say that? You idiot! That makes no sense.\u0027 Or, ‘That\u0027s just stupid.\u0027 Or, ‘Ahh, I can\u0027t believe I said that about a woman.\u0027 You should not like what you did back then, because that shows that you\u0027ve grown. If you\u0027re still doing it, that\u0027s a scarier place to be,\u0022 Noah says. \u000A\u000ATrevor Noah learned a long time ago, in circumstances far more terrifying than the ones he finds himself in now. \u000A\u000A\u0022So that\u0027s a great thing for me. When I get a chance to look back and go: ‘I was an idiot.\u0027 \u0022",

Not even Los Angeles. <em>Irvine</em>. Forty grim miles south through strip-mall country and the Orange County suburbs, where Noah is doing a three-night, five-show stand-up comedy run here at the Irvine Improv, home to your host Friendly Frank and some upcoming Bob Saget shows. Noah is trying, without a lot of luck so far, to get a rhythm going with a roomful of suburbanites&#x2014;grinding through a seventy-five-minute early-evening set, the first of two he&apos;s on the hook for tonight, like he&apos;s not about to start hosting <em>The Daily Show</em> in September. Like he&apos;s not arguably the most famous comedian in his native South Africa&#x2014;in all of Africa, full stop&#x2014;which he is and has been for the better part of a decade. Like he didn&apos;t just come here from the Met Ball in New York City, where he hung in the corner with Joel McHale and Seth Meyers, watching Rihanna sing and marveling at whatever his life has suddenly become. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.1">Why is Trevor Noah in Irvine? Maybe because he&apos;s a workhorse who has spent large parts of the past decade in semi-depressing solitude on the road. Maybe because he&apos;s saying one last good-bye to the road and the solitude and the stage. Maybe because Irvine is not Los Angeles or New York or any other place where he has to be on&#x2014;bright, shiny, new, ready for audiences one or two thousand times bigger than this one. Maybe because Irvine is not South Africa. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.2">Let&apos;s not talk about South Africa just yet. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.3">Set two goes better. It&apos;s dark outside now. Inside, everybody&apos;s laughing. American comics have learned to weigh down every joke with cement shoes of irony&#x2014;that sleepy, self-aware delivery, that vaguely self-hating stage presence. But Trevor Noah comes from a place where audiences barely understand what stand-up comedy even is. So he&apos;s up there working. He does a bit about how cell phones are making us all hunchbacked ape-people, and when he does the joke, you can see it, the reverse march of progress, proud man bent over his phone, shrinking back down to monkey. He&apos;s moving all over the stage. Mostly he&apos;s doing the same material from his first set&#x2014;observational bits about Ebola in Africa and freeway culture in Los Angeles&#x2014;but then he goes rogue and starts in on new stuff, high-degree-of-difficulty jokes about the senseless deaths of Walter Scott and Eric Garner and the charming, genteel bigotry of the American South (&quot;racism with a smile and a tip of the hat&quot;). Some of the things he&apos;s talking about only happened a month ago, and they&apos;re still beyond sad and/or fucked-up, but he&apos;s making us all wince and laugh in the precise wince/laugh ratio you&apos;d want from a comic talking about police-involved killings.</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.5"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="http://player.cnevids.com/embed/55a8411061646d2fb5000000/51097beb8ef9aff9f5000005" height="390" width="560"></iframe></div></div><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.6">Afterward he&apos;s backstage, sprawled out on a couch in weary content, and a few other comics crowd into the little room. He&apos;s got the well-proportioned features of the television host he&apos;s about to become. His smile is like something you might see during a job interview. Everybody&apos;s showing him the kind of deference reserved for someone who is supposed to be the next Jon Stewart. By the door is a tired-looking comedian named Gene Pompa, whom Noah knows from his road days, and Pompa soon starts in on Stewart, who advertised himself as this lightning rod of enlightenment but was in fact a white guy with a bunch of white boys writing for him, and how enlightened is that, really? Pompa says he&apos;s excited for Noah to take over, because he&apos;s going to do comedy that&apos;s authentically &quot;ethnic.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.7">There&apos;s a little silence. Then Trevor Noah smiles politely and begins to explain himself.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.8"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.9">Noah&apos;s earliest comedy bits were autobiographical, and to a degree, they still are&#x2014;his life has been so strange and so singular that he can relate it more or less as it happened and watch people laugh. Not that much of it was funny at the time. But Noah learned a long time ago that the only tolerable way to tell his story, even to himself, was as a joke. If you want to understand his comedy&#x2014;the fundamental apartness of it, the way it comes from the outside looking in&#x2014;you need to understand this first. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.a">&quot;My family is black on my mom&apos;s side, white on my father&apos;s side,&quot; Noah says over lunch one day. &quot;Then there&apos;s me.&quot; He was a mixed-race kid in apartheid South Africa, which is to say his birth was evidence of a crime; one early Noah routine was about how he learned to tell kids in his neighborhood that he was an albino, an unlikely story that was still more plausible than the truth. His parents were never truly together, and on the occasions that Noah&apos;s mother visited his father after Noah was born, she did so dressed as a maid. &quot;So I would see my dad&apos;s life, but it&apos;s like visiting Disney World. Even though you visit Disney World, you don&apos;t go, &#x2018;That&apos;s how life is.&apos; You go, &#x2018;No, I live my normal life, and Disney World exists.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.b">Noah&apos;s normal life was in the township of Soweto, a bunch of relatives in a two-room house. &quot;All the adults slept in one room, all the kids slept in the other room.&quot; This is the part of the story that Noah has since told many times, often for laughs. &quot;In the streets, my father couldn&apos;t walk with us,&quot; went one routine. &quot;He would walk on the other side of the road and wave at me&#x2014;like a creepy pedophile.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.c">But what happened next is something Noah has barely talked about at all. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.d">After the end of apartheid in 1994, Noah&apos;s father moved away, to Cape Town, and his mother&#x2014;Noah&apos;s partner in mischief, a voluble and funny woman who was fiercely protective of her only child&#x2014;meanwhile had married another man. Noah was only 9 or 10, but even then he regarded his new stepfather with suspicion. &quot;I just saw something behind the smile, you know? But as a kid, people don&apos;t take you seriously&#x2014;they&apos;re like, &#x2018;Hey, calm down. Everyone doesn&apos;t like their stepdad.&apos; &quot; The man moved in, and so commenced a violent and unhappy time in Noah&apos;s life. &quot;Over time, his true colors came out. He was an alcoholic; he was an extremely angry drunk person, very abusive.&quot; </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.e">His mother and stepfather had two children together, Noah&apos;s little brothers, even as his stepfather&apos;s abuse became steadily worse. &quot;He was sporadically abusive. I could count the abuse&#x2014;in a twelve-year marriage, I could say, three times, probably. Three or four times. But the scale at which the abuse&#x2014;like, the first time was slaps, a few slaps. The second time was slaps that turned into punches. The third time was basically using a blunt object or whatever.&quot; Noah finally moved out of the house when he was 17. His mother stuck it out, until she didn&apos;t, leaving with Noah&apos;s brothers a few years later.</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.f">By then Noah was living on his own in a cockroach-infested apartment. He was 22 and began telling jokes in his spare time, dodging an older generation of angry white comics who thought guys like Noah were arrogant just for getting onstage, let alone for doing so and then talking about apartheid or their own complex racial identities, as Noah did. &quot;A lot of the white comedians were feeling aggrieved. They were like, &#x2018;Why are the black comedians getting more laughs?&apos; And then they started hating on the fact that, I guess, we had experiences, we had a culture, we weren&apos;t just talking about the weather or escalators. We were going, &#x2018;This happened with my family,&apos; and, &#x2018;Let me tell you about the time I got arrested by the cops.&apos; We had experience; we had texture; we had layers; we had life.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.g">There was no way to get paid for the work, really, but it led to things, being onstage&#x2014;television work, mostly. By 24 he was hosting the South African Film and Television Awards, &quot;and then I was hosting our version of the Grammys, basically.&quot; Suddenly he was famous, if not necessarily for comedy, but for just being ubiquitous, around. Soon, because he finally could, he leveraged that fame into a book and a stand-up special, <em>The Daywalker</em>, among the first of its kind in South Africa. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.h">One night, while he was preparing for <em>The Daywalker</em>, his phone rang. &quot;It was funny in hindsight, because it was my little brother, and he&apos;s like, &#x2018;Hey, Trevor.&apos; I&apos;m like, &#x2018;Hey, what&apos;s up?&apos; He&apos;s like, &#x2018;Are you busy?&apos; I&apos;m like, &#x2018;No, I&apos;m sort of sleeping. What&apos;s going on?&apos; He&apos;s like, &#x2018;Mom&apos;s just been shot.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.i">Noah relates this story in an even tone, here in this brightly colored restaurant in the suburban bouncy castle that is Irvine, California, and that somehow makes it even more heartbreaking, his steady, deliberate march through the details. His mother and his brothers had just come home from church. Since she&apos;d left Noah&apos;s stepfather, she&apos;d become engaged to another man, and when her ex-husband found out, he&apos;d returned with a gun. Noah&apos;s brothers&#x2014;the man&apos;s own sons&#x2014;pleaded with him to leave. Instead, &quot;he started shooting, and my brothers ran for their lives, and my mom ran as well, and my uncle, and everybody who was there at the house&#x2014;everybody just ran for safety. My mom got shot, shot once in the torso, and another bullet went in her head. She got shot in the head, you know? And my brother&#x2014;to this day, the hero&#x2014;he grabbed my mom, threw her in the car, blood gushing everywhere, drove her to the hospital&quot;&#x2014;a 15-year-old kid who&apos;d only learned to drive two or three months prior, racing his dying mother to the hospital, which is in the end what may have saved her life. </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.j"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a7cc074e6e4c4f31a46d7a/master/w_600/trevor-noah-gq-05.jpg" alt="trevor-noah-gq-05.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftrevor-noah-ready-for-daily-show&amp;t=trevor-noah-gq-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftrevor-noah-ready-for-daily-show&amp;t=trevor-noah-gq-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftrevor-noah-ready-for-daily-show&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a7cc074e6e4c4f31a46d7a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftrevor-noah-gq-05.jpg&amp;description=trevor-noah-gq-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftrevor-noah-ready-for-daily-show&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a7cc074e6e4c4f31a46d7a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftrevor-noah-gq-05.jpg&amp;description=trevor-noah-gq-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.k">When Noah arrived, doctors told him it was a &quot;miracle&quot; that his mother had survived&#x2014;&quot;that&apos;s the word the doctor used, which doctors hate using, and I understand why. The bullet missed everything, went into the back of her head, missed her spine, missed all the nerves, everything, went through, didn&apos;t hit the brain, just went through the bottom, just under the brain, just smashed into her eye socket, which then deflected the bullet, and it came out of her nose.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.l">There is a point to this story beyond the obvious, and for Noah the point is this: </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.m">Two days after it happened, Noah was by her bedside, crying. His mother asked him to stop. &quot;She says, &#x2018;No, no. Please, look at the bright side. I&apos;m still here. Just be grateful that I&apos;m still here.&apos; I&apos;m like, &#x2018;Yeah, but still.&apos; She says, &#x2018;And on an even brighter side&#x2026;look at my nose. I&apos;ve got half a nose now. So now you&apos;re officially the best-looking person in the family. There&apos;s no contest.&apos; And then I start crying. Everyone&apos;s laughing and crying. You know? But that&apos;s who we were as people; that&apos;s who we&apos;ve always been.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.n">There are platitudes about situations like this, laughing to keep from crying, whatever doesn&apos;t kill you making you stronger, etc. Comics often claim that the fat-nerd misery they&apos;ve experienced in life gives them license to tell jokes about whatever sensitive subject they want. But this point of view is not an abstraction, or a moral convenience, to Trevor Noah. It is a simple hard-earned fact. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.o">&quot;It was one of those turning moments in life where I was like, &#x2018;You know what? No one can ever tell me that line of &#x2018;There&apos;s nothing funny about X.&apos; If you can&apos;t laugh, you have nothing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.p">Call that a clich&#xE9;. Tell that to Trevor Noah. </p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.q"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.r">When Noah takes over <em>The Daily Show</em> on September 28, it will mark the completion of a rapid and disorienting transition at Comedy Central, which has spent the past couple of years turning the much beloved trio of Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, and John Oliver into two relative unknowns, Larry Wilmore and Trevor Noah. It&apos;s maybe the biggest gamble in late night since NBC hired Conan to replace David Letterman. <em>The Daily Show!</em> Probably the most beloved modern comedy institution this side of <em>Saturday Night Live</em>. And Comedy Central is turning it over to a 31-year-old kid who most Americans haven&apos;t even heard of. Ask Comedy Central president Michele Ganeless how she feels about this turn of events and she will not bother to spin you: &quot;I will not lie. Yes: I have moments of great anxiety.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.s">The network had good reasons for choosing Noah, Ganeless says. &quot;He is a student of our culture. But he looks at it from a very different perspective.&quot; Also, he is &quot;super, super funny.&quot; Perhaps just as crucially, he is a generation removed from the older white men he&apos;s replacing. Noah &quot;really understands our audience, because he is one of them,&quot; Ganeless says, which I take as her way of saying that Comedy Central would be happy to discover, or rediscover, a younger and more demographically appealing audience than the one that was aging in lockstep with Stewart. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.t">His youth, his background, the outsider nature of his comedy&#x2014;all of that made him an appealing choice to the network. But it&apos;s also where the risk comes in. Noah has been telling jokes for a decade now, but much of that time was spent in South Africa, where audiences lean broad, rather than in America, where we&apos;ve long since honed our taste toward hyper-specificity and knowingness. To date, neither has been Noah&apos;s strength. And <em>The Daily Show</em>, in particular, is a temple to this type of humor, panning through our broken politics and broken cable-news channels for subtle nuggets of comic gold. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.u">Soon after Comedy Central announced that it had hired Noah, the network found itself defending him after people discovered old jokes of his on Twitter that, to put it gently, did not quite land. &quot;Almost bumped a Jewish kid crossing the road. He didn&apos;t look b4 crossing but I still would hav felt so bad in my german car!&quot; was one. &quot;&#x2018;Oh yeah the weekend. People are gonna get drunk &amp; think that I&apos;m sexy!&apos; - fat chicks everywhere&quot; was another. Many people found the tweets offensive. But maybe even more problematic, at least for Noah and Comedy Central, was that very few people found them even remotely funny. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.v">Less discussed but perhaps just as inflammatory was Noah&apos;s breakthrough performance in the United States, which came in 2012 on Jay Leno&apos;s <em>Tonight Show</em>. By then, <em>The Daywalker</em> had already made him a comedy icon in South Africa; he&apos;d hosted his own late-night talk show there, which he describes as &quot;a fusion between <em>The Daily Show</em> and <em>The Tonight Show</em>,&quot; making it through two seasons before running out of worthy guests. &quot;You go, &#x2018;Wow, we&apos;ve interviewed all twenty-six people who are famous enough right now, and there&apos;s literally no one else.&apos; &quot;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.w"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a7cc08ae529ee176ccba1c/master/w_600/trevor-noah-gq-07.jpg" alt="trevor-noah-gq-07.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftrevor-noah-ready-for-daily-show&amp;t=trevor-noah-gq-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftrevor-noah-ready-for-daily-show&amp;t=trevor-noah-gq-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftrevor-noah-ready-for-daily-show&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a7cc08ae529ee176ccba1c%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftrevor-noah-gq-07.jpg&amp;description=trevor-noah-gq-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftrevor-noah-ready-for-daily-show&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a7cc08ae529ee176ccba1c%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftrevor-noah-gq-07.jpg&amp;description=trevor-noah-gq-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.x">It was a moment when he could&apos;ve done more or less anything he&apos;d wanted, but it was also the moment when he began to feel South Africa closing in on him. So he decided to move to Pasadena, where a friend of his lived in this &quot;little white suburban world,&quot; and do stand-up all around the country for American audiences who had absolutely no idea who he was. For two years he toured tiny clubs in places like Lexington, Kentucky, and Erie, Pennsylvania, living on the road, surviving on gas-station food.</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.y">It was a weird time. &quot;Depression is probably your closest companion on those travels,&quot; Noah says bluntly. He estimates he made it to forty states in that time, more America than many Americans will ever see, moving through his adopted country like a ghost. &quot;You&apos;re people-sick. You&apos;re human-being-sick. You just want someone in your life. You want a friend. You want to know you exist.&quot; It was after he&apos;d done that for a while that Leno called. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.z">The Leno performance was a sort of proto-version of the first bits Noah would later do on <em>The Daily Show</em>: a quick-minded South African guy marveling at American culture and being astounded by what he finds. On Leno it&apos;s specifically African-American culture that he zooms in on&#x2014;a culture, Noah says now, that he was always in awe of. &quot;In my world, honestly, we grew up idolizing black Americans.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.10">But in the Leno routine, there&apos;s something weird and dissonant about the pronouns; watching it again recently, I felt myself cringe. Maybe you would&apos;ve needed to grow up here to understand how certain jokes about American black culture&#x2014;about the names people choose, about the way people speak&#x2014;have long served as a comic veil for unvarnished white racism.</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.11">But in 2012, Noah clearly didn&apos;t know that yet. &quot;I don&apos;t even really know where some of these &#x2018;African&apos; names come from,&quot; he jokes at one point. &quot;There&apos;s so many consonants so close together! It&apos;s almost like they lose their minds with the Scrabble pieces while giving birth. Like, &#x2018;What are we going to name her?! Oh snap&#x2014;Tanequa!&apos; &quot; </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.12">Later in the same bit, he says: &quot;I&apos;ve heard African-Americans, and oh, the way they speak, they pay no regard to punctuation whatsoever! Just cruise through sentences like poetry. I don&apos;t even understand half of it, but it sounds great.&quot; Then he does an imitation of what he&apos;s talking about, and over his shoulder you can see Leno and that evening&apos;s guest, Glenn Close, dying, two older white folks bent over with laughter.</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.13">Noah still defends this bit, but only to a point. &quot;I look back on it and I go, &#x2018;Had I known, I would&apos;ve done it differently.&apos; Because when you come from a different place, you don&apos;t realize the minefield you&apos;re walking into,&quot; he says. &quot;I do know this: I continued doing the Leno bit after I&apos;d done it on Leno. But the way I did it slash would do it today is completely different. I&apos;ve now learned how to be emotionally aware of how people may use your joke in a negative way. And that&apos;s something that you&apos;re always trying to navigate in comedy. You know, Dave Chappelle talked about it as well&#x2014;if you&apos;re not careful, someone can use your words to hurt somebody else.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.14">He says he particularly regrets one joke in that routine that was addressed specifically to African-Americans. &quot;I said: &#x2018;You&apos;re not African, but we play along.&apos; &quot; The problem was, &quot;I had given some people ammunition to oppress those who had already been oppressed.&quot; Now he feels that he&apos;d taken the wrong side. &quot;I hadn&apos;t fully understood the African-American experience. I hadn&apos;t read the books; I hadn&apos;t met the people; I hadn&apos;t traveled the country.&quot; </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.15"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&quot;I may not be American, but I am black,&quot; Noah says simply. &quot;It&apos;s not like I had to learn how to be black.&quot;</p></blockquote></span><div class="pullquote-share twitter"><a class="pullquote-share-icon" href="https://twitter.com/share?via=GQ&amp;text=%22%26quot%3BI%20may%20not%20be%20American%2C%20but%20I%20am%20black%2C%26quot%3B%20Noah%20says%20simply.%20%26quot%3BIt%26%2339%3Bs%20not%20like%20I%20had%20to%20learn%20how%20to%20be%20black.%26quot%3B%22" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.16">In Irvine, three years later, the pronouns had changed&#x2014;when he talked about Eric Garner, or Mike Brown, or Walter Scott, or getting pulled over by Los Angeles cops, it was &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot; and &quot;I,&quot; not &quot;you&quot; and &quot;they.&quot; The jokes were considerably more deft&#x2014;more funny, too. On the posthumous smearing of Walter Scott&#x2014;who was shot in the back as he ran from police in South Carolina&#x2014;by various news organizations, some of which made a point of bringing up an irrelevant 1987 assault-and-battery charge: &quot;What happened, did he punch this guy into the future?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.17">I ask Noah if he felt like he had to learn how to talk about this stuff. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.18">&quot;I may not be American, but I am black,&quot; Noah says simply. &quot;It&apos;s not like I had to learn how to be black.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.19"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.1a">He&apos;s still figuring out what <em>The Daily Show</em> will be, once they hand him the keys. &quot;I have a very vague picture of the show right now,&quot; Noah says. &quot;It&apos;ll be like a face-lift. Because, don&apos;t get it twisted, I&apos;m a big fan of <em>The Daily Show</em>, and that&apos;s what it&apos;s still gonna be. It&apos;s still gonna be <em>The Daily Show</em>. It&apos;s the same way, when Fallon took over from Leno, it&apos;s still <em>The Tonight Show</em>.&quot; </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.1b">I point out that Fallon has in fact completely changed <em>The Tonight Show</em> since taking over, turning a relatively staid talk show into a viral-video factory, and Noah agrees but says basically: The shift was natural and gradual, and he hopes to do the same thing. &quot;Just the mere fact that I&apos;m gonna be there in the chair changes a whole bunch of the show, you know?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.1c">He is, as he&apos;s always been, the unknown&#x2014;so much of his comedy has depended on that, the fact that he doesn&apos;t look like the people in the audience, the fact that he doesn&apos;t come from where they come from. And while Comedy Central is clearly excited about the demographic possibilities of the new <em>Daily Show</em>&#x2014;&quot;It is going to be really reflective of a millennial audience and a millennial point of view,&quot; Ganeless says&#x2014;you get the sense that for Noah, the challenge is more personal. It&apos;s about bringing us to him, not him to us; he&apos;ll conform, but only to a point. He&apos;s been winning over skeptical audiences his entire life&#x2014;why stop now?  </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.1d">In that respect, he says, the controversy that occurred after his hiring was necessary. &quot;A guy doesn&apos;t leave and another guy comes in and there&apos;s no backlash. That never, ever happens. When Michael B. Jordan got cast as the new Human Torch in <em>Fantastic Four</em>, there was backlash, because they were like, &#x2018;How can this fictional character be a black man?&apos; The new storm trooper from <em>Star Wars</em>, when he took his helmet off in the trailer, people lost their minds. &#x2018;This is ridiculous. How can there be black people in space?&apos; I didn&apos;t know what the backlash was gonna be, but I knew there was going to be backlash. The same thing when Larry Wilmore took over from Colbert: &#x2018;Oh, this is never gonna work. This is horrible.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><em>Is it coincidental that every example you just gave is a black man?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.1f">&quot;That&apos;s a good question,&quot; Noah says, and then repeats it again in that way you do when you&apos;re still waiting for an answer to arrive. &quot;Because there probably is something that plays into that, you know? I&apos;ve never considered it too much, but people are afraid of change.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.1g">Noah is more worried about whether he can change fast enough. He has been a quick study all his life&#x2014;by nature and by necessity. &quot;You show me half my jokes from even two years ago, three years ago&#x2014;I hate them. Because you see, like, a young version of yourself. You&apos;re like, &#x2018;Why would you say that? You idiot! That makes no sense.&apos; Or, &#x2018;That&apos;s just stupid.&apos; Or, &#x2018;Ahh, I can&apos;t believe I said that about a woman.&apos; You should not like what you did back then, because that shows that you&apos;ve grown. If you&apos;re still doing it, that&apos;s a scarier place to be,&quot; Noah says. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.1h">Trevor Noah learned a long time ago, in circumstances far more terrifying than the ones he finds himself in now. </p><p data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.4.1i">&quot;So that&apos;s a great thing for me. When I get a chance to look back and go: &#x2018;I was an idiot.&apos; &quot;</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1nxu1fyoi68.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
