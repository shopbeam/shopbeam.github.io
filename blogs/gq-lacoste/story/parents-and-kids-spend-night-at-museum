  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AOnce a month or so, the American Museum of Natural History in New York City offers families a chance to roam the museum\u0027s darkened halls and exhibits after-hours, Ben Stiller-like, then sleep on cots beneath the 21,000-pound whale hanging from the rafters of the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life. GQ ecutive editor Brendan Vaughan and his wife, writer Renee Dale, did the anthropological overnight with their four kids. Then they asked each other a key question: What the hell was that? \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARD: Brendan, considering the fact that it cost our family the same as flights to Rome, what compelled you to have this experience as a father?\u000A\u000A BV: You give me too much credit! This was your idea, but I will take credit for being very into it, and not just because I love a good cot. The Night at the Museum felt like the exact opposite of what drives kids\u0027 lives lately: technology, sports, daily agendas packed with more commitments than Joe Biden. It also seemed like a way to create a permanent memory for them. And for us, too. We\u0027ve gone on many dates there over the years, we\u0027ve always loved how primitive and romantic it is. What were you most looking forward to?\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestDADheart-imbed-120.jp\u000A\u000ARD: Public cot sex under the whale. No, I\u0027m joking. That was later. Our kids are growing up now in a very provincial Brooklyn, a place so navel gazing it\u0027s become a punch line. The Natural History Museum is the antithesis of all that, and awesomely analog. I want them to feel part of a continuum, to spend more time feeling small in the scope of the world\u0027s biodiversity. And it actually worked! After \u0022check-in,\u0022 our kids were in the Hall of African Mammals totally alone, chanting made-up African songs and marveling at their echoes bouncing around in the dark. Then we ignored our instincts and gave in to Boy 2, who begged to visit what he called \u0022the Ebola exhibit.\u0022 Like me, he\u0027s a disease connoisseur and enthusiast, which is fine until he becomes convinced he has guinea worms and river blindness. Simultaneously.\u000A\u000ABV: Oh God, the worms. The official title of that exhibit, by the way, is \u0022Countdown to Zero\u0022, which is supposed to be comforting--countdown to zero patients afflicted--but to me it sounded like countdown to zero people alive. Anyway, Boy 2 started to panic after studying graphic pics of stringy parasites being pulled out of peoples\u0027 feet. He asked repeatedly if guinea worm was \u0022a New York thing.\u0022\u000A\u000ARD: We live near the Gowanus Canal, so it would\u0027ve been a lie if I\u0027d given him a definitive no. [The Gowanus is a Superfund site now being marketed as \u0022waterfront living.\u0022] As we explored the museum with flashlights, was your sense of awe tempered by the fact that official \u0022lights out\u0022 wasn\u0027t until midnight? Moreover, were you afraid the bathrooms would get gross? I had a lot of emotions about the bathrooms.\u000A\u000ABV: Yes to your first question, no to your second. But then I was surprised at how quickly the evening zoomed by. Once I was done processing the \u0022holy shit isn\u0027t this cool that we have the whole museum to ourselves,\u0022 it was almost time for the 3D Imax film about chipmunks.\u000A\u000ARD: Those were scorpion mice, not chipmunks. Badass woodland creatures, immune to the scorpion poison that kills humans. They eat the scorpions instead--in a violent crunching fashion that includes howling at the moon. The mouse HOWLS AT THE MOON after devouring the scorp\u0027s tail! I forgive you, though, because during the Imax you smuggled in wine via our kids\u0027 Sigg bottle and maybe you were buzzed. But we\u0027ve skirted something important here: the penises.\u000A\u000ABV: There are a ton of penises in that building! And our kids pointed and guffawed at each and every one.\u000A\u000ARD: Even the empty space in dinosaur pelvises was suggestive for them. Shark peens, Neanderthal peens, rhino peens. Orangutan penises, gibbon penises, elephant penises, dik-dik dicks. Also of interest to our children were mammal and primate balls of all kinds. This guy was their favorite:\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABV: It\u0027s scary how much the boys relate to him.\u000A\u000ARD: They gazed upon him with sympathy, but also laughed like monstrous bullies at his rig--teeny yet assertive. That night there were a great many human units too, because the sleepover seems to be a very Dad thing to do. The place was filled with fathers and their kids. Suburban lacrosse dads in cozy fleece with gangs of boys all named Jack, international dads with iPads speaking French and Hindi. Anyway, they\u0027re all sleeping in the same room with you, just on the next cot!\u000A\u000ABV: Speaking of bedtime, I can sleep on a bed version of the Iron Throne, so I wasn\u0027t worried. But you? Different story.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ARD: Bedtime in general, with four kids, is an odyssey. There is something akin to getting to the finish line about it. There are willful delays, mostly due to the boys\u0027 bad ideas. Recently Boy 2, ten years old, got into the shower with his socks on. And it\u0027s verbally laborious too--Did you brush your teeth? Breathe on me. Can you not spit the toothpaste blobs onto the edge of the sink? Has anyone flossed? Ever? In some ways, this was easier. No one brushed their teeth or changed into pajamas. One of the boys attempted to change in the men\u0027s room but got spooked by the gang nudity and mass stripping. He slept in his Ronaldo kit. I changed into something preppy and demure—cultural institution sleepwear—but thought it would have been a hoot to exit the stalls in a sheer nightie. For the record, I brushed my teeth. When the six of us laid down on our cots all in a row and quietly stared up at the whale, our connected string of bodies in sleeping bags, it was magical.\u000A\u000ABut then, in the silence, I became consumed with worry that all of the men on the cots would begin snoring and farting. And that\u0027s exactly what happened. All of their mouths fell open at once, transforming what should have been the oceanic calm of the glorious space into The Great Hall of Apnea. A living diorama of Middle-Aged, Farting Mammals. I didn\u0027t sleep. I got up a lot, checked out sleeping strangers--many of whom looked dead--chatted with a night watchman clearly thinking, Who is this insomniac woman in a tunic and why in the world would she pay to sleep here on the floor?\u000A\u000ABV: Sometimes--ok, most of the time--it\u0027s so easy to be a Middle-Aged Male Mammal. I was immediately unconscious, and then, in the sleep-compressed equivalent of one long and peaceful eye-blink, there it was: MORNING!\u000A\u000ARD: When your eyes fluttered open, I appraised you with dark feelings of envy and resentment. I thought about the urns of weak coffee and colossal muffins wrapped in plastic that awaited us in cafeteria. But I wasn\u0027t grumpy. The kids were so excited to peek out of their sleeping bags and remember where they were. We broke museum rules and let them roam the building for a while unattended. One of them was barefoot. I\u0027m not a free-ranger, but I knew allowing this was non-negotiable. And I\u0027m certain they won\u0027t forget it.\u000A\u000ARight before we loaded up our lame but resplendent minivan to take us back to Brooklyn for multiple youth sporting contests, a lovely thing happened. The four of them were standing in front of a landscape diorama and called us over. They insisted it was a replica of our favorite, secret spot on the beach in Rhode Island where we go every year. It wasn\u0027t--it was a spot in the Pacific Northwest--but their insistence, and pride, in having made this discovery was what mattered. We might be in this museum someday, one of them said. They wanted to be a part of the place, to have their lives recognized by some future visitor. I suggested there might eventually be a diorama of them in their jerseys, leggings, and Kevin Durant sneakers. I couldn\u0027t resist, and even promised them it was likely to happen many years from now.\u000A\u000ABV: It just might! If we don\u0027t wiped out by guinea worm first.\u000A\u000AThe next three Nights at the Museum are July 17, August 9, and October 9.",

so, the American Museum of Natural History in New York City offers families a chance to roam the museum&#x2019;s darkened halls and exhibits after-hours, Ben Stiller-like, then sleep on cots beneath the 21,000-pound whale hanging from the rafters of the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life. </em>GQ<em> ecutive editor Brendan Vaughan and his wife, writer Renee Dale, did the anthropological overnight with their four kids.

This was your idea, but I will take credit for being very into it, and not just because I love a good cot. The Night at the Museum felt like the exact opposite of what drives kids&#x2019; lives lately: technology, sports, daily agendas packed with more commitments than Joe Biden. It also seemed like a way to create a permanent memory for them. And for us, too. We&#x2019;ve gone on many dates there over the years, we&#x2019;ve always loved how primitive and romantic it is.

No, I&#x2019;m joking. That was later. Our kids are growing up now in a very provincial Brooklyn, a place so navel gazing it&#x2019;s become a punch line. The Natural History Museum is the antithesis of all that, and awesomely analog. I want them to feel part of a continuum, to spend more time feeling small in the scope of the world&#x2019;s biodiversity. And it actually worked! After &quot;check-in,&quot; our kids were in the Hall of African Mammals totally alone, chanting made-up African songs and marveling at their echoes bouncing around in the dark. Then we ignored our instincts and gave in to Boy 2, who begged to visit what he called &quot;the Ebola exhibit.&quot; Like me, he&#x2019;s a disease connoisseur and enthusiast, which is fine until he becomes convinced he has guinea worms and river blindness. Simultaneously.</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>BV</strong>: Oh God, the worms. The official title of that exhibit, by the way, is &quot;Countdown to Zero&quot;, which is supposed to be comforting--countdown to zero patients afflicted--but to me it sounded like countdown to zero people alive. Anyway, Boy 2 started to panic after studying graphic pics of stringy parasites being pulled out of peoples&#x2019; feet. He asked repeatedly if guinea worm was &quot;a New York thing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>RD</strong>: We live near the Gowanus Canal, so it would&#x2019;ve been a lie if I&#x2019;d given him a definitive no. [The Gowanus is a Superfund site now being marketed as &quot;waterfront living.&quot;] As we explored the museum with flashlights, was your sense of awe tempered by the fact that official &quot;lights out&quot; wasn&#x2019;t until midnight? Moreover, were you afraid the bathrooms would get gross? I had a lot of emotions about the bathrooms.</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>BV</strong>: Yes to your first question, no to your second. But then I was surprised at how quickly the evening zoomed by. Once I was done processing the &quot;holy shit isn&#x2019;t this cool that we have the whole museum to ourselves,&quot; it was almost time for the 3D Imax film about chipmunks.</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>RD</strong>: Those were scorpion mice, not chipmunks. Badass woodland creatures, immune to the scorpion poison that kills humans. They eat the scorpions instead--in a violent crunching fashion that includes howling at the moon. The mouse HOWLS AT THE MOON after devouring the scorp&#x2019;s tail! I forgive you, though, because during the Imax you smuggled in wine via our kids&#x2019; Sigg bottle and maybe you were buzzed. But we&#x2019;ve skirted something important here: the penises.</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>BV</strong>: There are a ton of penises in that building! And our kids pointed and guffawed at each and every one.</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>RD</strong>: Even the empty space in dinosaur pelvises was suggestive for them. Shark peens, Neanderthal peens, rhino peens. Orangutan penises, gibbon penises, elephant penises, dik-dik dicks. Also of interest to our children were mammal and primate balls of all kinds. This guy was their favorite:</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.e"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.f"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55898ac7480f712308a64c13/master/w_806/blogs-the-feed-night-at-the-museum-02.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-night-at-the-museum-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fparents-and-kids-spend-night-at-museum&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-night-at-the-museum-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fparents-and-kids-spend-night-at-museum&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-night-at-the-museum-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fparents-and-kids-spend-night-at-museum&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55898ac7480f712308a64c13%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-night-at-the-museum-02.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-night-at-the-museum-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fparents-and-kids-spend-night-at-museum&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55898ac7480f712308a64c13%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-night-at-the-museum-02.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-night-at-the-museum-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>BV</strong>: It&#x2019;s scary how much the boys relate to him.</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>RD</strong>: They gazed upon him with sympathy, but also laughed like monstrous bullies at his rig--teeny yet assertive.

There is something akin to getting to the finish line about it. There are willful delays, mostly due to the boys&#x2019; bad ideas. Recently Boy 2, ten years old, got into the shower with his socks on. And it&#x2019;s verbally laborious too--Did you brush your teeth? Breathe on me. Can you not spit the toothpaste blobs onto the edge of the sink? Has anyone flossed? Ever? In some ways, this was easier. No one brushed their teeth or changed into pajamas. One of the boys attempted to change in the men&#x2019;s room but got spooked by the gang nudity and mass stripping. He slept in his Ronaldo kit. I changed into something preppy and demure&#x2014;cultural institution sleepwear&#x2014;but thought it would have been a hoot to exit the stalls in a sheer nightie. For the record, I brushed my teeth. When the six of us laid down on our cots all in a row and quietly stared up at the whale, our connected string of bodies in sleeping bags, it was magical.</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.l">But then, in the silence, I became consumed with worry that all of the men on the cots would begin snoring and farting. And that&#x2019;s exactly what happened. All of their mouths fell open at once, transforming what should have been the oceanic calm of the glorious space into The Great Hall of Apnea. A living diorama of Middle-Aged, Farting Mammals. I didn&#x2019;t sleep. I got up a lot, checked out sleeping strangers--many of whom looked dead--chatted with a night watchman clearly thinking, <em>Who is this insomniac woman in a tunic and why in the world would she pay to sleep here on the floor</em>?</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>BV</strong>: Sometimes--ok, most of the time--it&#x2019;s so easy to be a Middle-Aged Male Mammal. I was immediately unconscious, and then, in the sleep-compressed equivalent of one long and peaceful eye-blink, there it was: MORNING!</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>RD</strong>: When your eyes fluttered open, I appraised you with dark feelings of envy and resentment. I thought about the urns of weak coffee and colossal muffins wrapped in plastic that awaited us in cafeteria. But I wasn&#x2019;t grumpy. The kids were so excited to peek out of their sleeping bags and remember where they were. We broke museum rules and let them roam the building for a while unattended. One of them was barefoot. I&#x2019;m not a free-ranger, but I knew allowing this was non-negotiable. And I&#x2019;m certain they won&#x2019;t forget it.</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.o">Right before we loaded up our lame but resplendent minivan to take us back to Brooklyn for multiple youth sporting contests, a lovely thing happened. The four of them were standing in front of a landscape diorama and called us over. They insisted it was a replica of our favorite, secret spot on the beach in Rhode Island where we go every year. It wasn&#x2019;t--it was a spot in the Pacific Northwest--but their insistence, and pride, in having made this discovery was what mattered. <em>We might be in this museum someday</em>, one of them said. They wanted to be a part of the place, to have their lives recognized by some future visitor. I suggested there might eventually be a diorama of them in their jerseys, leggings, and Kevin Durant sneakers. I couldn&#x2019;t resist, and even promised them it was likely to happen many years from now.</p><p data-reactid=".13h9b9rd34.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>BV</strong>: It just might!
