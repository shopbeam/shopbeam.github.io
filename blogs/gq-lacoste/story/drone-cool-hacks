  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestPhoto: Chris Buck\u000A\u000AI never saw anyone naked. Not that seeing people naked was my goal, but the thought did occur to me. I might see people naked with this thing. I might catch people naked and masturbating. But this did not happen, because seeing people naked with a drone is harder than you might think.\u000A\u000AYou know all about drones by now, and what you know is probably bad. According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, almost 2,500 people have been killed—deliberately or otherwise--by unmanned military aircraft since the beginning of the Obama presidency. Air Force drone operators have reported high levels of burnout and PTSD. Drone warfare is redefining armed conflict and forcing us to consider the moral implications (and frankly, cowardice) of killing people from a desk chair.\u000A\u000AEven the legal uses of drones can seem awfully spooky. In December 2013, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos dazzled Charlie Rose by showing him a video of a delivery drone that could bring merchandise to your doorstep without you having to awkwardly sign the UPS guy\u0027s little scanner thing. While Rose marveled at the idea, the rest of us were terrified that Bezos was planning to bring us unwanted DVDs and then catch us masturbating. A Domino\u0027s franchisee has experimented with drone delivery, because apparently the experience of consuming Domino\u0027s pizza wasn\u0027t already enough of an automated process. Martha Stewart got a drone for her birthday and then wrote an essay for Time magazine praising its ability to monitor her gardenia beds. (Leave it to Martha Stewart to make gardening seem sinister.) Despite the fact that I have never met another person who owns a drone, or at least anyone who will admit to it, citizen drone use is growing fast.  According to the Washington Post, the FAA believes that \u0022within a decade, private drones will constitute a $90 billion industry.\u0022  Last year alone, 35 states introduced legislation attempting to regulate drone usage before it gets out of control. But maybe it already has. How would we know?\u000A\u000ABut if I\u0027ve learned anything in this life, it\u0027s that when a piece of ethically questionable technology comes around, you may as well join the party. I was late to text messaging. I\u0027d be damned if I was gonna be late to droning. Right now you can get yourself an adorable little flying quadcopter drone for around $200, or a really high-end personal drone starting at $1,000. (You could also build your own, but you\u0027re not going to do that.) So I ordered one. And while I waited giddily on my doorstep for my new robot friend to arrive, I drew up a list of covert missions to try with it. From here on, I will refer to these missions as \u0022sorties,\u0022 because owning a drone means I totally get to pretend I\u0027m a pilot now.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000ASORTIE #1: Fly the drone!\u000A\u000A The drone I got was the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 Elite Edition, which isn\u0027t actually the most elite drone that Parrot makes, but it\u0027s pretty good. It\u0027s solid. It\u0027s the Joe Flacco of drones. It arrived at my house in an unmarked cardboard box. So very mysterious. Let it be known that drone manufacturers are not shy about linking their products to military iconography. The drone\u0027s actual packaging box featured the drone sitting in an air hangar, looking out at a snowy mountain range. They even put a fighter-jet helmet next to it because FUCK YEAH DRONES. One look and I was ready to bomb the summit of Everest. My kids crowded around the box when it arrived.\u000A\u000A\u0022COOL!\u0022 my daughter screamed. \u0022Can I fly it?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022No,\u0022 I said.\u000A\u000A\u0022Can I ride it?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022No.\u0022\u000A\u000AI opened the box and the drone sat nestled in an elaborate cardboard tray that looked like a scale model of Carcosa. It came lacquered with digital-camo patterns for increased badassery. With the children frothing behind me, I took the drone outside and plugged in the rechargeable battery, and as soon as I did, little red lights flared up at the end of each of the four blades, like demon eyes. The drone was alive.\u000A\u000AThis particular drone was controlled via an iPhone app. You can also buy accessories for your drone glasses that let you \u0022see\u0022 from its perspective, headphones so you can hear what the drone hears, power gloves, controllers, and enough gear to make you feel like you\u0027re operating one of the jagers from Pacific Rim. But for now it was just me, the app and the drone. I opened up the app and it immediately asked for permission to access my photos and social networks. Whoa, hey, drone. You spy on people for me, you don\u0027t spy on me. I denied its requests.\u000A\u000AI went to the flight interface and found the TAKE OFF button on the bottom of the screen.\u000A\u000A\u0022Press it, Daddy!\u0022\u000A\u000AThe blades whirred to life and the drone jumped up from the ground, like a spooked insect.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m gonna call it Droney Loney,\u0022 my daughter said. \u0022GO DRONEY LONEY!\u0022\u000A\u000ABecause I am a man, I only read instruction manuals after I begin using something, so for a while I diddled around helplessly with the interface, trying to learn the controls as the thing was in mid-flight and ready to slice open a few faces. The kids and I watched the drone shoot up over our heads, tilt forward, graze over us, and land in a tree.\u000A\u000AI hadn\u0027t considered trees. The people at Parrot wisely left images of trees off their packaging because they know: TREES RUIN DRONES. My poor drone was stuck twelve feet in the air, and now I felt bad for it, like it was a new pet that I had somehow let down. It\u0027s one thing to lose a kite in a tree, because kites are annoying. This thing cost $250. Five seconds in, and it was clear that I was a greater threat to the drone than it was to everyone else. Fortunately, the drone had an RESCUE button you could push to free it. The blades spun and jerked until the quadcopter had managed to dislodge itself, dropping to the ground. It had grass stains on the blades. My little soldier\u0027s first combat wounds. They would not be its last.\u000A\u000AMISSION: Accomplished!\u000A\u000ASORTIE #2: Spy on a neighbor!\u000A\u000A Droney Loney\u0027s first real mission would be to fly above my neighbor\u0027s place two houses over and check out his pool. We\u0027d heard a rumor that he had the pool filled with cement to save some cash (and presumably to avoid ever having to invite my kids over for a dip). I needed hard evidence.\u000A\u000AI flew the drone over and now I was toggling between staring at the screen and staring at the actual drone in the sky to make sure it didn\u0027t go drifting off into a flock of geese. But eventually I got it into proper position and presto! There was my neighbor\u0027s yard, on my iPhone screen. And the pool looked to be filled with… water. Fully operational pool. No invitations to use it. What the fuck, Rob?\u000A\u000AWould I have wandered into the neighbor\u0027s yard on foot to gather this information? No. The drone allows you to go places you would not dare to go, or could not go, without putting yourself or others in harm\u0027s way. We\u0027re more willing to undertake dangerous pool-related missions when we know we don\u0027t have to risk anything.  The drone did all my dirty work for me and let me stay at home like a damn coward.  That\u0027s good work, Droney. \u000A\u000AMISSION: Accomplished!\u000A\u000ASORTIE #3: Dazzle local children!\u000A\u000A I figured I would accumulate a whole boatload of cool-dad points by taking the drone to the local park and blowing all the kids\u0027 skulls with it. And I was right: the second I set the thing down next to the playground, they came running. I launched the drone up over the treetops and they were rapt. All of them asked to fly it. A child molester could lure in a dozen victims with one of these things, which is not a pleasant thought. I decided to hold an informal focus group.\u000A\u000ADoes this thing scare you guys?\u000A\u000A\u0022No!\u0022 they all shouted.\u000A\u000AWhat would you do if you had one?\u000A\u000A\u0022I would spy on bad guys who were plotting to destroy the world,\u0022 one kid said.\u000A\u000AWould you freak out if the drone tried to spy on you?\u000A\u000A\u0022I would just hide under a tree,\u0022 my daughter said. Trees, man.\u000A\u000ASORTIE #4: Spy on an office building in the middle of a public square!\u000A\u000A I had used my drone in familiar settings up until now, free from any kind of judgment. It\u0027s easy to spy on people when no one can see you spying, or no one cares. But now it was time to fly the drone out in plain sight, among the general populace, to see what would happen as I tried to engage in a bit of spontaneous corporate espionage.\u000A\u000AAbove the metro station in downtown Bethesda is a little square flanked by office buildings and a hotel: the perfect place to fly a drone conspicuously and see if I would be judged/arrested/beaten to death. I wasn\u0027t wild about any of those prospects. Given the collective national handwringing over drones, walking into public with one feels like carrying around a visible firearm. You can sense people staring at you. They stared as they walked by, baffled, but too polite to actually ask what the hell I was doing. \u000A\u000AAlso, if you plan on getting any spying done with a drone, just know that a floating quadcopter does not go unnoticed. The camo did nothing. I may as well have been flying a vacuum cleaner. If you want to see a naked person with a drone, you better have lots of free time and they better be deaf.\u000A\u000AI sent the drone up next to the office building\u0027s second floor, turned it so it could peer into the window, watched it fly directly into the window like a confused pigeon, and then saw it drop straight to the asphalt.\u000A\u000AOH SHIT!\u000A\u000ANow whoever was in that office would totally know I was spying on them. Cops might come. I could be jailed. I freaked out, grabbed the poor drone off the ground, and fled into the parking garage elevator. \u000A\u000ALater, when I checked the recorded footage, I saw that the office I was spying on had its window shade drawn. I am a moron.\u000A\u000AMISSION: Not really accomplished!\u000A\u000ASORTIE #5: Fly the drone onto the White House lawn!\u000A\u000A Turns out this is also protected airspace! Do NOT try this. A GQ staffer suggested it and I consulted a map to check if spying on the President is a no-no. \u000A\u000AIt is very much a no-no.\u000A\u000AMISSION: Aborted!\u000A\u000ASORTIE #6: Land the drone on a rooftop, search for treasure!\u000A\u000A After the office building fiasco, I eventually got the hang of the controls. I wanted to fly the thing to the fucking moon. I took it up ten, twenty, thirty feet up, until it was hanging in the sky like a tiny UFO. It was so far up that, many times, I couldn\u0027t figure out if it was directly above me or if it had drifted off to the side. Operating a vehicle in three dimensions makes you cognizant of how lousy your depth perception is.\u000A\u000AI took my quadcopter over to a nearby high school. The football field had a small pavilion with a rooftop. It\u0027s possible that no mortal man—save for a roofer, I guess—had been on that roof for ages. There could have been anything up there. Gold! Used rubbers! Broken Michelob bottles! I couldn\u0027t get onto the roof myself, but ol\u0027 Droney could. So I flew him over the roof, tapped the LANDING button, and watched as he gently set down. My first successful rooftop landing. I felt like a chopper pilot evacuating a U.S. embassy. God bless you, Captain Drew.\u000A\u000AI checked the camera and scanned for free stuff. There was nothing. I also realized that the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 Elite Edition did not come with any kind of ELITE robotic claw or tractor beam, so even if it spied a chest full of diamonds on the roof, it couldn\u0027t do anything about it. But hey, at least I landed the thing. I also flew the drone over the playing fields, where kids were training for fall athletics. And now I know all of Walter Johnson High School\u0027s voluntary soccer training drills. A rival school would pay millions for such information.\u000A\u000AMISSION: Accomplished!\u000A\u000ASORTIE #7: Scare the shit out of a friend!\u000A\u000A It goes without saying that you should not play pranks on complete strangers with your drone, because strangers will become very angry and could probably have you prosecuted for numerous offenses. But a drone is useless if you don\u0027t embrace its capacity for freaking people out, so I drove over to my friend Jack\u0027s house and hid behind his garage.\u000A\u000A\u0022This is gonna be great!\u0022 I told the drone. We were friends now. He was my R2D2.\u000A\u000AUp went the drone and through its roving eye I could see Jack\u0027s bedroom window. TEE HEE HEE! I flew closer and closer, watching and waiting for Jack to open the window, scream in terror, and then call me an asshole. But there was only silence. So I flew the drone closer until it was a few inches from the window. I got too close, so I reared it back and then it flew into a tree. Is there anywhere you can fly these things without a goddamn tree getting in the way? I need a barren salt flat to pilot a drone properly.\u000A\u000AThis time, when I rescued the drone from the tree, one of its copter legs had broken and was now dangling sadly from the base. I was crushed.\u000A\u000AI called Jack.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m outside your house trying to scare you. Where are you?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, we\u0027re in the car. We\u0027re going to Jersey.\u0022\u000A\u000AShit. I should\u0027ve used the drone to check if he was home first.\u000A\u000AMISSION: Failure!\u000A\u000ASORTIE #9: Take a kickass scenic drone video!\u000A\u000A Droney was wounded. Badly. Possibly mortally. I had been tasked with taking care of this drone and I had failed. Its leg was hanging by a thread, wires exposed. So I patched it up with some duct tape, hoping it could hold on for a few more flights. I had yet to take a breathtaking aerial video with the drone, the kind of video that cannot be duplicated by any mortal man with a  landbound camera. This is what a lot of drone hobbyists use their drones for: art. (Also farming and map-making.) My family was headed to the beach for a vacation, and that seemed like the perfect place to put the drone to its proper use.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AOur vacation house was situated near a small lake. I set Droney down in a vast field overlooking the water. A neighbor out on his porch saw it.\u000A\u000A\u0022Is that a drone?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Yes.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022That is so cool.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis is what most people say about a drone if you don\u0027t look threatening, if you\u0027re standing on the porch of your lake house and not, say, in a downtown metropolis. A drone is a shitty stand-in for a person: faceless, impersonal, never blinking. But if you are there with it and you seem cool, then the drone becomes cool as well. People look. People are attracted to them.\u000A\u000AKids playing near the lake turned to stare at my drone. I was hoping to give them a show—a flying exhibition better than the Blue Angels and only 1/1,700th as loud. But immediately things went wrong. The blade on the bad leg soared up higher than the other three blades, and now Droney couldn\u0027t stabilize himself.  He was spinning out of control, faster and faster. Droney was drunk. I mashed down on the controls but it was no use. It\u0027s embarrassing to fly a drone poorly in front of people. They expect to be dazzled. It only takes a second for them to realize you\u0027re just a dipshit with a remote controlled camerabot and not a member of Delta Force.\u000A\u000ADroney fell helplessly to the ground and my kids turned away, now thoroughly uninterested. I went over and held Droney in my arms. There were so many more things I wanted to do with him: scare golfers, look at cows, make a flying sex tape, be the first man to get arrested for flying a drone inside a Southwest Airlines flight. But now those dreams were dashed.\u000A\u000AMISSION: FAILURE\u000A\u000AI took out my phone and looked at the video library that it had amassed. The last video it shot was little more than a blurry whizz, with my big fat head sweeping across the screen every half a second as the drone spun off into oblivion. I swiped over to another video of me spying on Jack\u0027s house, back when the drone was young and spry. Even in my clumsy hands, it\u0027s a thrill to fire up a video and see the picture begin to float up off the ground. It feels like an omnipotent extension of you. It feels as if you are up there, roaming around, exploring all that vast real estate in the sky.  \u000A\u000ALike any piece of technology, a drone is only as evil as the person using it. Our paranoia concerning drones is rooted in the assumption that its users are malevolent and competent, when in fact most people are neither. At one point I joined an online group for drones users, and I signed up using only my first name. For my status message I typed in \u0022I love drones!\u0022 because I couldn\u0027t think of anything else. I sounded like a drone narc. I kept looking for some dark corner of the bulletin board—someone with a status message proclaiming \u0022I just wanna see some pussy\u0022—but it was no use. The only time I saw a tinge of villainy was when one commenter suggested staging a drone-user protest at Reagan National Airport, which is protected airspace. The other commenters immediately shouted him down for being a jackass. \u000A\u000AI even went to a drone lab (it\u0027s a workshop, really) and met the group in person.  You will not feel threatened by your standard drone hobbyist. It\u0027s like going to a convention for Lionel train set collectors. Part of the problem for drones is that word—drone—which sounds evil. (Maybe we should call them puppybots?) If we decide to become a bunch of frothing robo-papparazzi who spy on one another and turn this country into a nation of voyeurists—catching each other jacking it, sending each other down a bottomless well of shame—it won\u0027t be because a drone made us that way. It\u0027s because we wanted it to happen.\u000A\u000AWhen I used my drone at a park, a friend of mine spotted me and immediately wanted to buy one. His wife rolled her eyes. \u0022Another gadget,\u0022 she muttered. And she\u0027s exactly right. Yes, some people will do sketchy shit with their drones, just like they do with guns and the Internet. But for most us, they\u0027ll be just another gadget, another thing to geek out over and make our lives slightly, needlessly easier.\u000A\u000AJust watch out for those goddamn trees",

Not that seeing people naked was my goal, but the thought did occur to me. <em>I might see people naked with this thing. I might catch people naked and masturbating.</em> But this did not happen, because seeing people naked with a drone is harder than you might think.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.2">You know all about drones by now, and what you know is probably bad. According to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, almost 2,500 people have been killed&#x2014;deliberately or otherwise--by unmanned military aircraft since the beginning of the Obama presidency. Air Force drone operators have reported high levels of burnout and PTSD. Drone warfare is redefining armed conflict and forcing us to consider the moral implications (and frankly, cowardice) of killing people from a desk chair.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.3">Even the legal uses of drones can seem awfully spooky. In December 2013, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos dazzled Charlie Rose by showing him a video of a delivery drone that could bring merchandise to your doorstep without you having to awkwardly sign the UPS guy&apos;s little scanner thing. While Rose marveled at the idea, the rest of us were terrified that Bezos was planning to bring us unwanted DVDs and <em>then</em> catch us masturbating. A Domino&apos;s franchisee has experimented with drone delivery, because apparently the experience of consuming Domino&apos;s pizza wasn&apos;t already enough of an automated process. Martha Stewart got a drone for her birthday and then wrote an essay for Time magazine praising its ability to monitor her gardenia beds. (Leave it to Martha Stewart to make gardening seem sinister.) Despite the fact that I have never met another person who owns a drone, or at least anyone who will admit to it, citizen drone use is growing fast.&#xA0; According to the Washington Post, the FAA believes that &quot;within a decade, private drones will constitute a $90 billion industry.&quot;&#xA0; Last year alone, 35 states introduced legislation attempting to regulate drone usage before it gets out of control. But maybe it already has. <em>How would we know?</em></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.5">But if I&apos;ve learned anything in this life, it&apos;s that when a piece of ethically questionable technology comes around, you may as well join the party. I was late to text messaging. I&apos;d be damned if I was gonna be late to droning. Right now you can get yourself an adorable little flying quadcopter drone for around $200, or a really high-end personal drone starting at $1,000. (You could also build your own, but you&apos;re not going to do that.) So I ordered one. And while I waited giddily on my doorstep for my new robot friend to arrive, I drew up a list of covert missions to try with it. From here on, I will refer to these missions as &quot;sorties,&quot; because owning a drone means I totally get to pretend I&apos;m a pilot now.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.6">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>SORTIE #1: Fly the drone!</strong></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.8"> The drone I got was the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 Elite Edition, which isn&apos;t actually the <em>most</em> elite drone that Parrot makes, but it&apos;s pretty good. It&apos;s solid. It&apos;s the Joe Flacco of drones. It arrived at my house in an unmarked cardboard box. So very mysterious. Let it be known that drone manufacturers are not shy about linking their products to military iconography. The drone&apos;s actual packaging box featured the drone sitting in an air hangar, looking out at a snowy mountain range. They even put a fighter-jet helmet next to it because FUCK YEAH DRONES. One look and I was ready to bomb the summit of Everest. My kids crowded around the box when it arrived.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.9">&quot;COOL!&quot; my daughter screamed. &quot;Can I fly it?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.a">&quot;No,&quot; I said.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.b">&quot;Can I <em>ride</em> it?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.c">&quot;No.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.d">I opened the box and the drone sat nestled in an elaborate cardboard tray that looked like a scale model of Carcosa. It came lacquered with digital-camo patterns for increased badassery. With the children frothing behind me, I took the drone outside and plugged in the rechargeable battery, and as soon as I did, little red lights flared up at the end of each of the four blades, like demon eyes. The drone was <em>alive</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.e">This particular drone was controlled via an iPhone app. You can also buy accessories for your drone glasses that let you &quot;see&quot; from its perspective, headphones so you can hear what the drone hears, power gloves, controllers, and enough gear to make you feel like you&apos;re operating one of the jagers from <em>Pacific Rim</em>. But for now it was just me, the app and the drone. I opened up the app and it immediately asked for permission to access my photos and social networks. <em>Whoa, hey, drone. You spy on people </em>for<em> me, you don&apos;t spy </em>on<em> me</em>. I denied its requests.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.f">I went to the flight interface and found the TAKE OFF button on the bottom of the screen.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.g">&quot;Press it, Daddy!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.h">The blades whirred to life and the drone jumped up from the ground, like a spooked insect.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;I&apos;m gonna call it Droney Loney,&quot; my daughter said. &quot;GO DRONEY LONEY!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.j">Because I am a man, I only read instruction manuals <em>after</em> I begin using something, so for a while I diddled around helplessly with the interface, trying to learn the controls as the thing was in mid-flight and ready to slice open a few faces. The kids and I watched the drone shoot up over our heads, tilt forward, graze over us, and land in a tree.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.k">I hadn&apos;t considered trees. The people at Parrot wisely left images of trees off their packaging because they know: TREES RUIN DRONES. My poor drone was stuck twelve feet in the air, and now I felt bad for it, like it was a new pet that I had somehow let down. It&apos;s one thing to lose a kite in a tree, because kites are annoying. This thing cost $250. Five seconds in, and it was clear that I was a greater threat to the drone than it was to everyone else. Fortunately, the drone had an RESCUE button you could push to free it. The blades spun and jerked until the quadcopter had managed to dislodge itself, dropping to the ground. It had grass stains on the blades. My little soldier&apos;s first combat wounds. They would not be its last.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.l">MISSION: Accomplished!</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>SORTIE #2: Spy on a neighbor!</strong></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.n"> Droney Loney&apos;s first real mission would be to fly above my neighbor&apos;s place two houses over and check out his pool. We&apos;d heard a rumor that he had the pool filled with cement to save some cash (and presumably to avoid ever having to invite my kids over for a dip). I needed hard evidence.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.o">I flew the drone over and now I was toggling between staring at the screen and staring at the actual drone in the sky to make sure it didn&apos;t go drifting off into a flock of geese. But eventually I got it into proper position and <em>presto</em>! There was my neighbor&apos;s yard, on my iPhone screen. And the pool looked to be filled with&#x2026; <em>water</em>. Fully operational pool. No invitations to use it. What the fuck, Rob?</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.p">Would I have wandered into the neighbor&apos;s yard on foot to gather this information? No. The drone allows you to go places you would not dare to go, or could not go, without putting yourself or others in harm&apos;s way. We&apos;re more willing to undertake dangerous pool-related missions when we know we don&apos;t have to risk anything.&#xA0; The drone did all my dirty work for me and let me stay at home like a damn coward.&#xA0; That&apos;s good work, Droney.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.q">MISSION: Accomplished!</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>SORTIE #3: Dazzle local children!</strong></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.s"> I figured I would accumulate a whole boatload of cool-dad points by taking the drone to the local park and blowing all the kids&apos; skulls with it. And I was right: the second I set the thing down next to the playground, they came running. I launched the drone up over the treetops and they were rapt. All of them asked to fly it. A child molester could lure in a dozen victims with one of these things, which is not a pleasant thought. I decided to hold an informal focus group.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.t"><em>Does this thing scare you guys?</em></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.u">&quot;No!&quot; they all shouted.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.v"><em>What would you do if you had one?</em></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.w">&quot;I would spy on bad guys who were plotting to destroy the world,&quot; one kid said.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.x"><em>Would you freak out if the drone tried to spy on you?</em></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.y">&quot;I would just hide under a tree,&quot; my daughter said. Trees, man.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>SORTIE #4: Spy on an office building in the middle of a public square!</strong></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.10"> I had used my drone in familiar settings up until now, free from any kind of judgment. It&apos;s easy to spy on people when no one can see you spying, or no one cares. But now it was time to fly the drone out in plain sight, among the general populace, to see what would happen as I tried to engage in a bit of spontaneous corporate espionage.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.11">Above the metro station in downtown Bethesda is a little square flanked by office buildings and a hotel: the perfect place to fly a drone conspicuously and see if I would be judged/arrested/beaten to death. I wasn&apos;t wild about any of those prospects. Given the collective national handwringing over drones, walking into public with one feels like carrying around a visible firearm. You can sense people staring at you. They stared as they walked by, baffled, but too polite to actually ask what the hell I was doing.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.12">Also, if you plan on getting any spying done with a drone, just know that a floating quadcopter does not go unnoticed. The camo did nothing. I may as well have been flying a vacuum cleaner. If you want to see a naked person with a drone, you better have lots of free time and they better be deaf.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.13">I sent the drone up next to the office building&apos;s second floor, turned it so it could peer into the window, watched it fly directly into the window like a confused pigeon, and then saw it drop straight to the asphalt.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.14"><em>OH SHIT!</em></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.15">Now whoever was in that office would totally know I was spying on them. Cops might come. I could be jailed. I freaked out, grabbed the poor drone off the ground, and fled into the parking garage elevator.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.16">Later, when I checked the recorded footage, I saw that the office I was spying on had its window shade drawn. I am a moron.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.17">MISSION: Not really accomplished!</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.18"><strong>SORTIE #5: Fly the drone onto the White House lawn!</strong></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.19"> Turns out this is <em>also</em> protected airspace! Do NOT try this. A <em>GQ</em> staffer suggested it and I consulted a map to check if spying on the President is a no-no.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1a">It is very much a no-no.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1b">MISSION: Aborted!</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><strong>SORTIE #6: Land the drone on a rooftop, search for treasure!</strong></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> After the office building fiasco, I eventually got the hang of the controls. I wanted to fly the thing to the fucking moon. I took it up ten, twenty, thirty feet up, until it was hanging in the sky like a tiny UFO. It was so far up that, many times, I couldn&apos;t figure out if it was directly above me or if it had drifted off to the side. Operating a vehicle in three dimensions makes you cognizant of how lousy your depth perception is.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1e">I took my quadcopter over to a nearby high school. The football field had a small pavilion with a rooftop. It&apos;s possible that no mortal man&#x2014;save for a roofer, I guess&#x2014;had been on that roof for ages. There could have been anything up there. Gold! Used rubbers! Broken Michelob bottles! I couldn&apos;t get onto the roof myself, but ol&apos; Droney could. So I flew him over the roof, tapped the LANDING button, and watched as he gently set down. My first successful rooftop landing. I felt like a chopper pilot evacuating a U.S. embassy. <em>God bless you, Captain Drew</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1f">I checked the camera and scanned for free stuff. There was nothing. I also realized that the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 Elite Edition did not come with any kind of ELITE robotic claw or tractor beam, so even if it spied a chest full of diamonds on the roof, it couldn&apos;t do anything about it. But hey, at least I landed the thing. I also flew the drone over the playing fields, where kids were training for fall athletics. And now I know all of Walter Johnson High School&apos;s voluntary soccer training drills. A rival school would pay <em>millions</em> for such information.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1g">MISSION: Accomplished!</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><strong>SORTIE #7: Scare the shit out of a friend!</strong></p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1i"> It goes without saying that you should not play pranks on complete strangers with your drone, because strangers will become very angry and could probably have you prosecuted for numerous offenses. But a drone is useless if you don&apos;t embrace its capacity for freaking people out, so I drove over to my friend Jack&apos;s house and hid behind his garage.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1j">&quot;This is gonna be great!&quot; I told the drone. We were friends now. He was my R2D2.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1k">Up went the drone and through its roving eye I could see Jack&apos;s bedroom window. TEE HEE HEE! I flew closer and closer, watching and waiting for Jack to open the window, scream in terror, and then call me an asshole. But there was only silence. So I flew the drone closer until it was a few inches from the window. I got too close, so I reared it back and then it flew into a tree. Is there anywhere you can fly these things without a goddamn tree getting in the way? I need a barren salt flat to pilot a drone properly.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1l">This time, when I rescued the drone from the tree, one of its copter legs had broken and was now dangling sadly from the base. I was crushed.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1m">I called Jack.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1n">&quot;I&apos;m outside your house trying to scare you.

Badly. Possibly mortally. I had been tasked with taking care of this drone and I had failed. Its leg was hanging by a thread, wires exposed. So I patched it up with some duct tape, hoping it could hold on for a few more flights. I had yet to take a breathtaking aerial video with the drone, the kind of video that cannot be duplicated by any mortal man with a&#xA0; landbound camera. This is what a lot of drone hobbyists use their drones for: art. (Also farming and map-making.) My family was headed to the beach for a vacation, and that seemed like the perfect place to put the drone to its proper use.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1t"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c105e52bc4b477a9bb51/master/w_925/entertainment-2015-06-train-your-drone-03.jpg" alt="entertainment-2015-06-train-your-drone-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdrone-cool-hacks&amp;t=entertainment-2015-06-train-your-drone-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdrone-cool-hacks&amp;t=entertainment-2015-06-train-your-drone-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdrone-cool-hacks&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c105e52bc4b477a9bb51%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-06-train-your-drone-03.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-06-train-your-drone-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdrone-cool-hacks&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c105e52bc4b477a9bb51%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-06-train-your-drone-03.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-06-train-your-drone-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1u">Our vacation house was situated near a small lake. I set Droney down in a vast field overlooking the water. A neighbor out on his porch saw it.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1v">&quot;Is that a drone?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1w">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1x"> &quot;That is so cool.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1y">This is what most people say about a drone if you don&apos;t look threatening, if you&apos;re standing on the porch of your lake house and not, say, in a downtown metropolis. A drone is a shitty stand-in for a person: faceless, impersonal, never blinking. But if you are there with it and you seem cool, then the drone becomes cool as well. People look. People are attracted to them.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.1z">Kids playing near the lake turned to stare at my drone. I was hoping to give them a show&#x2014;a flying exhibition better than the Blue Angels and only 1/1,700th as loud. But immediately things went wrong. The blade on the bad leg soared up higher than the other three blades, and now Droney couldn&apos;t stabilize himself.&#xA0; He was spinning out of control, faster and faster. Droney was drunk. I mashed down on the controls but it was no use. It&apos;s embarrassing to fly a drone poorly in front of people. They expect to be dazzled. It only takes a second for them to realize you&apos;re just a dipshit with a remote controlled camerabot and not a member of Delta Force.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.20">Droney fell helplessly to the ground and my kids turned away, now thoroughly uninterested. I went over and held Droney in my arms. There were so many more things I wanted to do with him: scare golfers, look at cows, make a flying sex tape, be the first man to get arrested for flying a drone inside a Southwest Airlines flight. But now those dreams were dashed.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.21">MISSION: FAILURE</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.22">I took out my phone and looked at the video library that it had amassed. The last video it shot was little more than a blurry whizz, with my big fat head sweeping across the screen every half a second as the drone spun off into oblivion. I swiped over to another video of me spying on Jack&apos;s house, back when the drone was young and spry. Even in my clumsy hands, it&apos;s a thrill to fire up a video and see the picture begin to float up off the ground. It feels like an omnipotent extension of you. It feels as if <em>you</em> are up there, roaming around, exploring all that vast real estate in the sky.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.23">Like any piece of technology, a drone is only as evil as the person using it. Our paranoia concerning drones is rooted in the assumption that its users are malevolent and competent, when in fact most people are neither. At one point I joined an online group for drones users, and I signed up using only my first name. For my status message I typed in &quot;I love drones!&quot; because I couldn&apos;t think of anything else. I sounded like a drone narc. I kept looking for some dark corner of the bulletin board&#x2014;someone with a status message proclaiming &quot;I just wanna see some pussy&quot;&#x2014;but it was no use. The only time I saw a tinge of villainy was when one commenter suggested staging a drone-user protest at Reagan National Airport, which is protected airspace. The other commenters immediately shouted him down for being a jackass.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.24">I even went to a drone lab (it&apos;s a workshop, really) and met the group in person.&#xA0; You will not feel threatened by your standard drone hobbyist. It&apos;s like going to a convention for Lionel train set collectors. Part of the problem for drones is that word&#x2014;drone&#x2014;which sounds evil. (Maybe we should call them puppybots?) If we decide to become a bunch of frothing robo-papparazzi who spy on one another and turn this country into a nation of voyeurists&#x2014;catching each other jacking it, sending each other down a bottomless well of shame&#x2014;it won&apos;t be because a drone made us that way. It&apos;s because we wanted it to happen.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.25">When I used my drone at a park, a friend of mine spotted me and immediately wanted to buy one. His wife rolled her eyes. &quot;Another gadget,&quot; she muttered. And she&apos;s exactly right. Yes, some people will do sketchy shit with their drones, just like they do with guns and the Internet. But for most us, they&apos;ll be just another gadget, another thing to geek out over and make our lives slightly, needlessly easier.</p><p data-reactid=".iss0wyo1kw.1.1.0.0.4.26">Just watch out for
