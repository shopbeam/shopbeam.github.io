  	    "articleBody": "11 A.M., MAY 17, 2015TWIN PEAKS RESTAURANTWACO, TEXAS\u000A\u000AThe Twin Peaks chain is the most successful of America\u0027s post-Hooters wave of so-called breastaurants. (\u0022Hooters,\u0022 the co-founder of Twin Peaks has said, \u0022wasn\u0027t racy enough.\u0022) Flirty waitresses wear skimpy mountaineering outfits: tiny khaki shorts, midriff-baring plaid shirts, climbing boots. A sign outside promises EATS • DRINKS • SCENIC VIEWS. \u000A\u000AThough it had been open less than a year, the Twin Peaks in Waco was already a popular spot for Thursday Biker Nights. The Texas Confederation of Clubs and Independents—a kind of United Nations General Assembly for local motorcycle clubs—had never held its bimonthly meeting at Twin Peaks before, but the organization\u0027s state chairman was returning from a national convention, and he wanted to speak to as many Texas bikers as possible about various legislative initiatives. Waco is situated between Dallas and Austin, two of the most populous biker cities in Texas.\u000A\u000AAfterward—after nine bikers were shot dead, 20 were wounded, and an unprecedented 177 people from at least five different clubs wound up in police custody—the Waco Police Department would claim that the bloodbath was triggered by the Bandidos and the Cossacks, a pair of rival \u0022outlaw motorcycle gangs\u0022 (OMGs in law-enforcement vernacular), beefing over the things that OMGs tend to beef over: territory, respect. Months later, though, the Waco P.D. was still suppressing any video footage and ballistic analysis that could offer proof. Some of the 177 arrested (including four women) languished in jail for weeks, others for months, before they could afford to post bail. All of them, even guys who hid out in the bathroom while bullets flew, face up to 99 years in jail.\u000A\u000AThese bimonthly confederation meetings, known as COC meetings, are mostly arcane discussions of motorcycle-rights issues. They have zero history of violence. Then again, they have virtually zero history of Cossack participation. In fact, May 17 marked only the second time in memory any of the club\u0027s members had ever attended a COC meeting; for years, they\u0027d refused to join the organization—a direct rebuke to the Bandidos, Texas\u0027s most powerful motorcycle club and one of the nation\u0027s largest, with more than 2,000 members. But things had been ugly between the two rivals for a while—fistfights, knife fights, roadside beatings. Infrequent, but growing in brutality.\u000A\u000AAs a general rule, bikers are not big talkers. It\u0027s an insular and suspicious world, especially in Texas, especially now, in the hazy aftermath of the bloodiest day in the often sensationalized history of American biker clubs. Nevertheless, all the Cossacks interviewed by GQ for this story insist they showed up that morning to make peace. And virtually every biker I spoke with last June and July—Cossacks, Bandidos, members of multiple other clubs, 22 bikers in total—believes that the real blame for all the dead bodies belongs with the Waco police.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #1: (1) We had almost 70 men, and we showed up at the same time, because we don\u0027t like being left on the road in small groups, because of what\u0027s been happening. We went in and ordered drinks.\u000A\u000AVincent Glenn (officer, Waco P.D., from an affidavit dated June 15): The Cossacks and their support clubs took over the patio area, which is the exact area of the restaurant that was reserved for the [COC] meeting.\u000A\u000AAnonymous motorcycle-club member: We noticed all the Cossacks sitting on the patio. We gave respect to them, them being a bigger group and having so many people there.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #1: A group of seven Bandidos rolled up on bikes, furious that we were parking up front. They hit one of our prospects, an older guy—ran over his foot.\u000A\u000AReginald Weathers (Bandidos, from court testimony at his bail hearing): My president and vice president tried to back in, and immediately the Cossacks on the porch came out and started pushing their bikes [away], saying they couldn\u0027t park there. [Cossacks] kept coming off the patio, over the fence—60 to 100 guys. They were yelling at my president [and] my vice president.\u000A\u000AGlenn (from his affidavit): Several of the Cossacks pulled their weapons, including handguns.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #1: Of course, we\u0027re not gonna back down. We\u0027re men. One of our sergeants at arms—our guys in charge of security—said, \u0022We can take our cuts [vests with club patches] off right now, and you and I can fight.\u0022 The guy says, \u0022No, we\u0027re not doin\u0027 that.\u0022 Our sergeant at arms says, \u0022Then let\u0027s go in and have a beer and talk about it.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestBodies of slain bikers lie where they fell in the Twin Peaks parking lot. Rod Aydelotte/Waco Tribune Herald/Polaris.\u000A\u000AJohn Wilson (Cossacks Motorcycle Club, McLennan County chapter president): It looked like it was all going to calm down.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #2: And then somebody, I think it was a Bandido, said, \u0022Don\u0027t talk to my president that way.\u0022\u000A\u000AWeathers (from court testimony): I said, \u0022I don\u0027t think you need to talk to my president like that.\u0022 I didn\u0027t think it was very respectful. He hit me. My head got pulled down. There was a crowd of guys, and I couldn\u0027t see anything.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #2: Fists flew, and it was game on. They went to the ground. Seconds later, I heard bang!\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Bandidos vs. The Cossacks\u000A\u000AThe Bandidos are terrorists. They execute people.—Jon \u0022Hondo\u0022 Moses, Cossacks, Hill County chapter\u000A\u000AThe Cossacks are a bunch of inbred corn-fed dumb fucking hillbillies. That\u0027s my personal fucking opinion on those stupid asses.—anonymous Bandido\u000A\u000AThe Bandidos were baptized in blood. They were founded in 1966 by an ex-Marine and Vietnam vet named Don Chambers, whose road name was Mother and who led the club until 1972, when he and two other men were convicted of double murder. They abducted two drug dealers who\u0027d cheated the Bandidos on a meth deal, forced the dealers to dig their own graves in the Texas desert, then shot them and set fire to their bodies. Chambers\u0027s three successors were all taken down by the feds for a variety of offenses. During the 1970s, \u002780s, and \u002790s, the Bandidos did everything the feds continue to accuse them of doing today, including trafficking in narcotics and prostitution. But there hasn\u0027t been a major Bandidos bust since 2011, when 39 club members and associates were arrested in Dallas, San Antonio, and Denver on gun and drug charges. Jeff Pike, the club\u0027s publicity-shy current president, has held office—mostly quietly—since 2005. \u0022The \u002760s are over,\u0022 one Bandido insisted to me.\u000A\u000AMost bikers today, in Texas and elsewhere, are community-minded law-and-order Republicans—the less affluent, more racially diverse descendants of the Elks and the Knights of Columbus. This includes Bandidos. But as \u0022one-percenters,\u0022 the Bandidos also exist in a category apart from most other clubs. More of a boast than an admission of criminal intent, \u0022one-percenter\u0022 is a reference to a long-ago line attributed to the American Motorcyclist Association that 99 percent of motorcycle owners are decent, law-abiding citizens. It\u0027s unclear whether the Bandidos are, as the feds continue to insist, an organized-crime enterprise, but it is likely that they tolerate a minority of members who are criminals and who use their brothers\u0027 loyalty as cover. When I asked one Bandido whether his chapter would kick out a brother who was engaging in criminal activity, he replied cautiously: \u0022It would be the best thing to do.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestRoadblock (with mic) of the Zealots motorcycle club takes roll call at a COC meeting in Frankston, Texas.Benjamin Rasmussen\u000A\u000AToday, as the dominant club in Texas, the Bandidos enforce order among the state\u0027s thousands of bikers. \u0022I have personally been around the Bandidos for thousands of hours and have never known them to be violent,\u0022 says Steve Cochran, founder and vice president of Sons of the South and a prominent spokesman for the Texas biker community. \u0022There are certain responsibilities as the dominant club that you have to attend to. And one of those things is to disallow knuckleheads, like what showed up at Twin Peaks, to destroy the motorcycle-riding community in the state and to disallow their ability to function.\u0022\u000A\u000AMuch less is known about the Cossacks, except that they were founded in 1969 in East Texas, and they are growing rapidly. They claim a current membership of about 800 members, which would make them the second-biggest club in Texas after the Bandidos.\u000A\u000AOver the past two years, the Bandidos and Cossacks appear to have been engaged in a simmering power struggle. In November 2013, two Cossacks were stabbed in a roadhouse parking lot in Abilene; the president of the local Bandidos chapter was arrested in connection with the assault. Earlier this year, on March 22, Cossacks allegedly forced a Bandido rider off I-35 in Lorena and beat him so brutally—with chains and metal pipes—that he nearly lost an eye. At a gas station in Mingus that same day, Bandidos confronted the Cossack son of a local politician and demanded that he remove the Texas \u0022rocker,\u0022 or badge, from his cut. When he refused, they allegedly attacked him with a hammer. The FBI and members of both clubs believe several additional clashes were never reported.\u000A\u000ASteve Cochran (co-founder and vice president, Sons of the South): There are no Bandidos in Waco. The Cossacks arrived on the scene three or four years ago. They started flexing on all the other clubs in the area. They would claim they own Waco. They would harass all the other motorcycle clubs: \u0022You can\u0027t ride here. This is our town.\u0022\u000A\u000AJohn Wilson (Cossacks): We never told anybody that Waco was a Cossack town, that nobody else was allowed to ride here. We were welcomed by all the different establishments. The only club that had a problem with us didn\u0027t have a chapter here. There was a Bandidos chapter in Waco, oh, probably 12 years ago, but those guys were involved in a murder in a local bar, and after that, they got shut down.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Bandido #2: Some Cossacks might be Klan members. They wear the lightning bolts.\u000A\u000AWilson: I don\u0027t know if anybody actually ever said S.S. lightning bolts were outlawed, but there are no white-supremacist patches allowed. If some guy sewed one on, he might not have got called on it yet.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #1: The Bandidos invited us to [the COC meeting at Twin Peaks]. That\u0027s why we were there earlier than any other club. We were told, \u0022This meeting is about us stopping all this crap.\u0022 The agreement was made by a Bandido named Marshall Mitchell.\u000A\u000AMarshall Mitchell (Bandidos): That\u0027s a lie. That is an absolute lie. They were never invited. Categorically absolute b.s. You can ask any motorcycle club in the world. You never bring 60 people to a meeting [as the Cossacks did; the Bandidos had about 20]. It\u0027s three people and three people, or two people and two people, and that\u0027s the way it is.\u000A\u000AGlenn (from his affidavit): A Waco gang-intelligence officer learned that the Cossacks were upset that the Bandidos changed the location of the [May 17 COC] meeting to \u0022their territory.\u0022 The Cossacks made the decision to take a stand and attend the meeting uninvited.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A12:24 P.M., MAY 17, 2015TWIN PEAKS RESTAURANTWACO, TEXAS\u000A\u000AThe police were already there as the rest of the clubs arrived that morning. \u0022They\u0027re circling like buzzards on a dead deer,\u0022 one biker told me. \u0022I look at the people I was riding with, and I said, ‘This don\u0027t look right.\u0027 \u0022 Afterward, said the Cossacks\u0027 John Wilson, \u0022a Waco spokesman was touting the quick 40-second response time of the police, when that was obviously false. They were here.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe bikers believe this provides a clue to the Waco P.D.\u0027s ongoing silence: The cops know their response was overzealous, possibly unlawful, and now they\u0027re covering it up. Some bikers believe there\u0027s an even more sinister explanation: that a firefight of some kind was supposed to happen—that it was all part of a plan by the Waco P.D. to provoke bitter rivals into a public brawl that could be violently crushed and then used as a basis for sweeping RICO indictments.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestLeft to right: Elder; Switch (left) and Taz. The Desperados and Los Miradores are both \u0022support clubs,\u0022 or allies, of the Bandidos.\u000A\u000A\u0022We basically walked into an ambush,\u0022 says the Cossacks\u0027 Jon \u0022Hondo\u0022 Moses. \u0022The die was cast as soon as we rode into that parking lot.\u0022\u000A\u000AWilson: I didn\u0027t see who fired the first shot. I was told it was a Bandido firing into the ground, trying to break up a fistfight.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #2: I thought it was just a warning shot from somebody. I was dazed. I stood in place. I thought they had fired a gun in the air to make everything stop.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #1: I felt a concussion from the pistol. It was a black semiautomatic.\u000A\u000AAnonymous motorcycle-club member: We heard a pop. Then a few more pops. Your feet start to act. There\u0027s pops from the rear, from the front, on the far side. It\u0027s like being in a war zone.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #2: I heard projectiles zinging past me, but I didn\u0027t hear no gun going off. It was either a silenced weapon or a very suppressed weapon in the distance. I\u0027ve never been so scared in my life.\u000A\u000AUnidentified Waco P.D. officer #1 (from radio traffic): Dispatch units soonest—Twin Peaks! Shots fired, several people down!\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #1: One [shot] killed Richie, our regional sergeant at arms. Another went through the neck of our sergeant at arms. This Bandido jumped off his bike and attacked him. He was beatin\u0027 the crap out of my S.A., right? He had gloves with lead in \u0027em. But when my S.A. got on top of him—he\u0027s a good ol\u0027 boy—this other Bandido came up from behind with a pistol and shot him in the neck. Well, we assume he was a Bandido—he wasn\u0027t with us. (2) My S.A. lived. He was very lucky. I pulled myself in underneath my motorcycle, making myself as small a target as possible. I was just breathing and hoping it would end soon. I just kept hearing shots. Long-distance.\u000A\u000AAnonymous motorcycle-club member: Now, the first two or three pops—me and half my crew being ex-military, we know what small-arms fire from pistols sounds like. We also know what squad automatic weapons [typically used by the military and law enforcement] sound like. After the third pop, it was nothing but squad automatic weapons.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #1: I got shot, and I didn\u0027t know it until it started burning. I looked down and saw a hole. It was bleeding pretty bad. I wadded my shirt and held it and yelled out, \u0022I\u0027m hit!\u0022 Then I saw Diesel [a fellow Cossack] get shot in the forehead. He also took cover next to me. He wasn\u0027t shooting or nothing.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #2: I watched the top of Diesel\u0027s head come off and land on another dude\u0027s jeans. I was probably ten yards away from where it happened. And his son was standing right there beside him and watched it happen. Watched his dad die. Another brother of mine had a gut-shot hole I could\u0027ve stuck my thumb in. He had Diesel\u0027s brains on his pant leg.  \u000A\u000AWeathers (from court testimony): I was shot, I have no clue by who. It went through my right arm into my chest. I\u0027m on a blood thinner, so it\u0027s a big deal to get hit. I ran for the other side of the vehicles parked near the Don Carlos Mexican restaurant to find some cover.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #2: I\u0027d guess the shooting lasted two to three minutes, but when you got bullets flying over your head, three minutes is a long time. I will never forget any of that. Nothing I\u0027d seen in the Marines had really prepared you for that. I have a couple of friends in the Cossacks who\u0027ve done three tours in Iraq. They\u0027re like, \u0022I\u0027ve never seen no shit like this before.\u0022\u000A\u000AUnidentified Waco P.D. officer #2 (from radio traffic): Do not send an ambulance! Have \u0027em stage [nearby]. This place is hot!\u000A\u000AWilson: The police rounded everybody up and marched us out and through the carnage in the parking lot. We were detained, but we weren\u0027t cuffed. We were just sitting there and trying to take care of our wounded. Bear was shot in the abdomen and the legs. Rattle Can was shot in his torso, and he was bleeding bad and had even started to convulse while he was there on the ground while officers stood around with rifles pointed at us. Rattle Can was laying there in a lot of pain, and my son and others were over there, trying to stick bandannas in bullet holes. He was able to talk for a while, but before they picked him up, he had slipped into unconsciousness. That\u0027s really all I want to say about that.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #1: I was losing a lot of blood. I started to lose consciousness at that point. A member of the Boozefighters came up and helped me. He ignored the protocols of \u0022stay with your club\u0022; he must have been an EMT or first responder. He told the guy to apply pressure, took shirts off and whatnot. He was saving lives.\u000A\u000AWilson: Not a single law-enforcement person lifted a finger to help any of the wounded. And they made it pretty clear that they were going to be violent if we tried to take our guys to the ambulance. Three men were bleeding out before our eyes. If those men were still alive 30, 40 minutes after being shot, they could have been saved. A prospect named Trainer from out of Tarrant County chapter was shot. They zip-tied him and laid him on the ground next to a Bandido they had handcuffed. I noticed him jerk a few times, laying there. We were sitting there, 30 feet from him, and weren\u0027t able to help him. About two hours later, somebody walked over, looked at him, and covered him with a yellow sheet.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000APatches 101 : What Does \u0022ACAB\u0022 Mean?\u000A\u000ABikers take their patches very seriously. And many patches mean different things to different clubs. Here\u0027s a taxonomy of the ones whose origins we could decode.—Benjy Hansen-Bundy\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest1.The thirteenth letter of the alphabet, for motorcycle (or, say, meth) | 2.

It\u0027s rumored that Bandidos founder Don Chambers chose this \u0022fat Mexican\u0022 insignia to be more racially inclusive than the then predominantly white Hells Angels. It\u0027s clumsy and racially tone-deaf, but the Bandidos do have many Hispanic members. | 4. \u0022Motorcycle Club\u0022\u000A\u000AThe Waco P.D.\u000A\u000ASergeant Patrick Swanton, the Waco Police Department\u0027s affably officious spokesman, gave seven press conferences in the first three days after the shootings. He became a minor media celebrity.\u000A\u000AWith so little evidence available to the public, Swanton had complete control of the narrative, and he took the opportunity to declare, repeatedly, that the COC meeting at Twin Peaks had been a criminal gathering and that every biker who attended was a gang member. When a reporter observed that many bikers had disputed these claims, Swanton was dismissive. \u0022They lied,\u0022 he said. The dead men ranged in age from 27 to 65: seven Cossacks, one Bandido, and one unaffiliated biker—the 65-year-old—who was an ex-Marine recipient of the Purple Heart for service in Vietnam.\u000A\u000ABy his final press conference, Swanton seemed to be struggling to defend his early characterizations of the clubs. A reporter asked, \u0022Can you please respond to criticism…that not all 170 [jailed bikers] are criminals, that a lot of [them] are totally innocent and had nothing to do with the shooting?\u0022 \u0022No, I can\u0027t respond to that,\u0022 Swanton shot back, then hastily moved on. For a while, Swanton continued posting press releases about the shootings on the Waco P.D.\u0027s Facebook page, but all of them have since been deleted.\u000A\u000AThe Texas Department of Public Safety did its part to ramp up hysteria, leaking a \u0022confidential bulletin\u0022 to CNN alleging that Bandidos in active military service were arming their chapters with grenades and C4 explosives so that they could retaliate against the police. One of the DPS\u0027s sources was a club called the Black Widows, which does not exist except in the 1978 movie Every Which Way But Loose. In response, one biker blog jeered: \u0022Waco Police Now Claim They Are Being Attacked by Clint Eastwood and An Orangutan Named Clyde.\u0022\u000A\u000AAny attempt to try to piece together exactly how the nine bikers died—whose guns fired the fatal shots—requires wading into JFK-assassination levels of paranoia and confusion. For instance, members of multiple clubs have claimed that when the shooting started, two Cossacks stood up inside the restaurant, took off their cuts, and put on badges. Were they undercover cops waiting for a fight to break out, and if so, did they play a part in instigating it? Other witnesses have said that a Waco cop wearing a Cossacks cut was firing shots, then helped make arrests afterward.\u000A\u000AAccording to Waco police chief Brent Stroman, only three of his 16 officers discharged their weapons, firing a total of 12 rounds. But eyewitnesses dispute that figure, as does the owner of the adjacent Don Carlos restaurant, who has claimed that \u0022thousands of bullet rounds\u0022 were fired. Could it be that the department\u0027s numbers don\u0027t include shots from its undercover officers? And if the bikers were firing at police, as alleged, why hasn\u0027t the Waco P.D. released any hard evidence to prove it?\u000A\u000A\u0022Harried handgun fights are usually a pretty inaccurate situation,\u0022 says Cossacks chapter president John Wilson. \u0022Head shots happen by mistake, if at all. Someone got lucky. To have that many guys hit with torso shots and head shots—in my experience, I would say that indicates you had trained people with long rifles and optical sights. That\u0027s accurate, aimed fire.\u0022 (3)\u000A\u000AA rival Bandido, who declined to be named, reached the same conclusion: \u0022Seven of the nine [dead] were head shots or chest shots. Who trains for that? Who?\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestFrom left: Soldiers for Jesus president Woody Woodward; the Comanche Warriors of Athens, Texas.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Waco 177\u000A\u000AThe volume of arrests at Twin Peaks completely overwhelmed the city\u0027s criminal-processing system. Many of the Waco 177 waited days to be provided with a lawyer while the desperate court system sought help from neighboring cities. \u0022Like if you were in a fast-food restaurant and three buses pulled up,\u0022 a local judge named Billy Ray Stubblefield told the Waco Tribune, \u0022and all the kids want their food just as fast as they normally do.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s still unclear why so many of the bikers were arrested in the first place, when it appears that so few of them were actually involved in the shoot-out. Three bikers were arrested despite arriving after the shooting stopped; Swanton later said it was because they were carrying guns—legally, as it later appeared—and because they were \u0022wearing the colors of criminal gang members.\u0022\u000A\u000ASwanton, meanwhile, is now trying to parlay his elevated profile into a run for county sheriff.\u000A\u000AWilson: We were lined up and zip-tied, had our shoes taken from us and our belts and anything in our pockets. We were taken to the Waco Convention Center, where we were set on the floor, and we spent the next 18 or so hours there.\u000A\u000AAnonymous motorcycle-club member: They ask me to identify my belongings that are in a big old pile of shit. It\u0027s like 177 bags, no names on them.\u000A\u000AMatt Clendennen (Scimitars Motorcycle Club): Chair, floor—wherever we could find to sleep is where we slept, with our hands tied behind our backs. I didn\u0027t sleep much.\u000A\u000AAnonymous motorcycle-club member: At two or three in the morning, I had my zip ties popped off for about four minutes so that I could pee. Then they put a new set on, just as tight, and brought us a piece of fried chicken and a little bitty cup of water. Have you ever tried to eat something with your hands behind your back?\u000A\u000AWilson: They took our clothes and put us in jail uniforms and stood us in front of a camera and told us we were on a $1 million bond and snapped our picture. I was in shock. The vast, vast majority of those people committed no crime. I kept thinking, There\u0027s some mistake.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #2: To get out on a $1 million bond, it\u0027ll cost $100,000. How many people can just pull that out of their pocket?\u000A\u000AWilson: I was in jail 28 days. My son was in for 37. We\u0027re not wealthy people, so it took a lot longer for him to get his bond reduced.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #2: I was in for 27 days. We had our bad moments, you know, when we\u0027d get off the phone from talking to our wives or loved ones and be very down.\u000A\u000AWilson: Some of these guys were on PTSD medications that they were denied in jail. One of our guys was ten months out of Afghanistan, and it was very hard on him. I saw him break down several times.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #2: They dropped my bond down to $250,000. My lawyer screamed and screamed; they dropped it down to $65,000. Here\u0027s my wife trying to raise up 10 percent to get me out of jail, and I only got to talk to her once a day for 15 minutes.\u000A\u000AClendennen: When I got out, I was in a hurry to pick my son up on his last day of school. My wife told him I was on a business trip, because he\u0027s 4 years old and his understanding of going to jail is you\u0027ve done something wrong. We have a minivan, and my wife opened the door, and I was sitting in the backseat. He was surprised and overjoyed and confused all at the same time. The next morning, I had to get back to my job. When he woke up, he was real upset that I wasn\u0027t there. It hit him real heavy. He was thinking I was going to be gone again.\u000A\u000AAnonymous Cossack #2: We have one guy that was a United Airlines pilot. For years. He lost his whole career.\u000A\u000AAnonymous motorcycle-club member: When you get out of jail after being gone for 30 days, you don\u0027t have a job anymore. I got fired. Nobody wants to hire an electrician with a class 1 felony charge pending above his head.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Waco Justice System\u000A\u000A\u0022The city of Waco is looking at paying out hundreds of millions of dollars,\u0022 says Michael White, Wilson\u0027s attorney. \u0022I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve ever seen something on the scale of 175-plus people being arrested for something they did not do.\u0022 To survive the storm, the city\u0027s legal strategy seems to be to pressure the Waco 177 into pleading guilty to minor infractions for time served; this would preclude the bikers from being able to sue for wrongful imprisonment.\u000A\u000AJustice of the peace Walter \u0022Pete\u0022 Peterson\u0027s across-the-board imposition of $1 million bonds—\u0022to send a message,\u0022 he said—was almost certainly illegal. Waco P.D. officer Manuel Chavez later admitted in court that Peterson signed all 177 of the so-called cookie-cutter probable-cause affidavits in bulk, without specifying the evidence against each individual defendant. Peterson, it turns out, is a former state trooper with no legal training.\u000A\u000ANevertheless, the Waco 177 still have their work cut out for them. The judge in the case, Matt Johnson, is the former law partner of district attorney Abel Reyna. Incredibly, the foreman of the first grand jury to be convened, James Head, is a Waco P.D. detective. \u0022He was chosen totally at random, like the law says,\u0022 Reyna insisted to local reporters. If this seems brazen, consider that the commission to appoint jurors was originally going to be led by Reyna\u0027s own father. Reyna only backed down under pressure, acquiescing to the process that led to Head\u0027s selection. Asked why he\u0027d permit an active police officer to lead a grand jury investigating possible police misconduct, state district judge Ralph Strother said, \u0022I just thought, ‘Well, he\u0027s qualified. He knows the criminal-justice system.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AOn his first day as a grand juror, Head wore his badge and service pistol. Later, when a reporter asked him if he\u0027d taken part in the Waco operation, Head responded: \u0022Not really.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ANathaniel Penn is a GQ correspondent.\u000A\u000A(1) At the request of some interviewees, certain names and/or identifying details have been changed or withheld.  \u000A\u000A(2) Bandido or not, this biker has yet to be identified.  \u000A\u000A(3) The DPS declined an interview request. Swanton cordially e-mailed to say he would \u0022touch base\u0022 with me the following morning, then melted away.",

(&#x201C;Hooters,&#x201D; the co-founder of Twin Peaks has said, &#x201C;wasn&apos;t racy enough.&#x201D;) Flirty waitresses wear skimpy mountaineering outfits: tiny khaki shorts, midriff-baring plaid shirts, climbing boots. A sign outside promises EATS &#x2022; DRINKS &#x2022; SCENIC VIEWS. </p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.2">Though it had been open less than a year, the Twin Peaks in Waco was already a popular spot for Thursday Biker Nights. The Texas Confederation of Clubs and Independents&#x2014;a kind of United Nations General Assembly for local motorcycle clubs&#x2014;had never held its bimonthly meeting at Twin Peaks before, but the organization&apos;s state chairman was returning from a national convention, and he wanted to speak to as many Texas bikers as possible about various legislative initiatives. Waco is situated between Dallas and Austin, two of the most populous biker cities in Texas.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.3">Afterward&#x2014;after nine bikers were shot dead, 20 were wounded, and an unprecedented 177 people from at least five different clubs wound up in police custody&#x2014;the Waco Police Department would claim that the bloodbath was triggered by the Bandidos and the Cossacks, a pair of rival &#x201C;outlaw motorcycle gangs&#x201D; (OMGs in law-enforcement vernacular), beefing over the things that OMGs tend to beef over: territory, respect. Months later, though, the Waco P.D. was still suppressing any video footage and ballistic analysis that could offer proof. Some of the 177 arrested (including four women) languished in jail for weeks, others for months, before they could afford to post bail. All of them, even guys who hid out in the bathroom while bullets flew, face up to 99 years in jail.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.5">These bimonthly confederation meetings, known as COC meetings, are mostly arcane discussions of motorcycle-rights issues. They have zero history of violence. Then again, they have virtually zero history of Cossack participation. In fact, May 17 marked only the second time in memory any of the club&apos;s members had ever attended a COC meeting; for years, they&apos;d refused to join the organization&#x2014;a direct rebuke to the Bandidos, Texas&apos;s most powerful motorcycle club and one of the nation&apos;s largest, with more than 2,000 members. But things had been ugly between the two rivals for a while&#x2014;fistfights, knife fights, roadside beatings. Infrequent, but growing in brutality.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.6">As a general rule, bikers are not big talkers. It&apos;s an insular and suspicious world, especially in Texas, especially now, in the hazy aftermath of the bloodiest day in the often sensationalized history of American biker clubs. Nevertheless, all the Cossacks interviewed by <em>GQ</em> for this story insist they showed up that morning to make peace. And virtually every biker I spoke with last June and July&#x2014;Cossacks, Bandidos, members of multiple other clubs, 22 bikers in total&#x2014;believes that the real blame for all the dead bodies belongs with the Waco police.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Anonymous Cossack #1:</strong> (1) We had almost 70 men, and we showed up at the same time, because we don&apos;t like being left on the road in small groups, because of what&apos;s been happening.

That&apos;s my personal fucking opinion on those stupid asses.<br><em>&#x2014;anonymous Bandido</em></p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>The Bandidos were</strong> baptized in blood. They were founded in 1966 by an ex-Marine and Vietnam vet named Don Chambers, whose road name was Mother and who led the club until 1972, when he and two other men were convicted of double murder. They abducted two drug dealers who&apos;d cheated the Bandidos on a meth deal, forced the dealers to dig their own graves in the Texas desert, then shot them and set fire to their bodies. Chambers&apos;s three successors were all taken down by the feds for a variety of offenses. During the 1970s, &#x2019;80s, and &#x2019;90s, the Bandidos did everything the feds continue to accuse them of doing today, including trafficking in narcotics and prostitution. But there hasn&apos;t been a major Bandidos bust since 2011, when 39 club members and associates were arrested in Dallas, San Antonio, and Denver on gun and drug charges. Jeff Pike, the club&apos;s publicity-shy current president, has held office&#x2014;mostly quietly&#x2014;since 2005. &#x201C;The &#x2019;60s are over,&#x201D; one Bandido insisted to me.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.o">Most bikers today, in Texas and elsewhere, are community-minded law-and-order Republicans&#x2014;the less affluent, more racially diverse descendants of the Elks and the Knights of Columbus. This includes Bandidos. But as &#x201C;one-percenters,&#x201D; the Bandidos also exist in a category apart from most other clubs. More of a boast than an admission of criminal intent, &#x201C;one-percenter&#x201D; is a reference to a long-ago line attributed to the American Motorcyclist Association that 99 percent of motorcycle owners are decent, law-abiding citizens. It&apos;s unclear whether the Bandidos are, as the feds continue to insist, an organized-crime enterprise, but it is likely that they tolerate a minority of members who are criminals and who use their brothers&apos; loyalty as cover. When I asked one Bandido whether his chapter would kick out a brother who was engaging in criminal activity, he replied cautiously: &#x201C;It would be the best thing to do.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.p"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/560aca9fdfc9eee35e9ebda5/master/w_768/texas-biker-gang-gq-1015-02.jpg" alt="texas-biker-gang-gq-1015-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funtold-story-texas-biker-gang-shoot-out&amp;t=texas-biker-gang-gq-1015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funtold-story-texas-biker-gang-shoot-out&amp;t=texas-biker-gang-gq-1015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funtold-story-texas-biker-gang-shoot-out&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F560aca9fdfc9eee35e9ebda5%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftexas-biker-gang-gq-1015-02.jpg&amp;description=texas-biker-gang-gq-1015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funtold-story-texas-biker-gang-shoot-out&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F560aca9fdfc9eee35e9ebda5%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftexas-biker-gang-gq-1015-02.jpg&amp;description=texas-biker-gang-gq-1015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>Roadblock (with mic) of the Zealots motorcycle club takes roll call at a COC meeting in Frankston, Texas.</p></span><div class="credits">Benjamin Rasmussen</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.q">Today, as the dominant club in Texas, the Bandidos enforce order among the state&apos;s thousands of bikers. &#x201C;I have personally been around the Bandidos for thousands of hours and have never known them to be violent,&#x201D; says Steve Cochran, founder and vice president of Sons of the South and a prominent spokesman for the Texas biker community. &#x201C;There are certain responsibilities as the dominant club that you have to attend to.

In November 2013, two Cossacks were stabbed in a roadhouse parking lot in Abilene; the president of the local Bandidos chapter was arrested in connection with the assault. Earlier this year, on March 22, Cossacks allegedly forced a Bandido rider off I-35 in Lorena and beat him so brutally&#x2014;with chains and metal pipes&#x2014;that he nearly lost an eye. At a gas station in Mingus that same day, Bandidos confronted the Cossack son of a local politician and demanded that he remove the Texas &#x201C;rocker,&#x201D; or badge, from his cut. When he refused, they allegedly attacked him with a hammer. The FBI and members of both clubs believe several additional clashes were never reported.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>Steve Cochran</strong> <em>(co-founder and vice president, Sons of the South):</em> There are no Bandidos in Waco.

He became a minor media celebrity.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.1t">With so little evidence available to the public, Swanton had complete control of the narrative, and he took the opportunity to declare, repeatedly, that the COC meeting at Twin Peaks had been a criminal gathering and that every biker who attended was a gang member. When a reporter observed that many bikers had disputed these claims, Swanton was dismissive. &#x201C;They lied,&#x201D; he said. The dead men ranged in age from 27 to 65: seven Cossacks, one Bandido, and one unaffiliated biker&#x2014;the 65-year-old&#x2014;who was an ex-Marine recipient of the Purple Heart for service in Vietnam.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.1u">By his final press conference, Swanton seemed to be struggling to defend his early characterizations of the clubs. A reporter asked, &#x201C;Can you please respond to criticism&#x2026;that not all 170 [jailed bikers] are criminals, that a lot of [them] are totally innocent and had nothing to do with the shooting?&#x201D; &#x201C;No, I can&apos;t respond to that,&#x201D; Swanton shot back, then hastily moved on. For a while, Swanton continued posting press releases about the shootings on the Waco P.D.&apos;s Facebook page, but all of them have since been deleted.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.1v">The Texas Department of Public Safety did its part to ramp up hysteria, leaking a &#x201C;confidential bulletin&#x201D; to CNN alleging that Bandidos in active military service were arming their chapters with grenades and C4 explosives so that they could retaliate against the police. One of the DPS&apos;s sources was a club called the Black Widows, which does not exist except in the 1978 movie <em>Every Which Way But Loose.</em> In response, one biker blog jeered: &#x201C;Waco Police Now Claim They Are Being Attacked by Clint Eastwood and An Orangutan Named Clyde.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.1w">Any attempt to try to piece together exactly how the nine bikers died&#x2014;whose guns fired the fatal shots&#x2014;requires wading into JFK-assassination levels of paranoia and confusion. For instance, members of multiple clubs have claimed that when the shooting started, two Cossacks stood up inside the restaurant, took off their cuts, and put on badges. Were they undercover cops waiting for a fight to break out, and if so, did they play a part in instigating it? Other witnesses have said that a Waco cop wearing a Cossacks cut was firing shots, then helped make arrests afterward.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.1x">According to Waco police chief Brent Stroman, only three of his 16 officers discharged their weapons, firing a total of 12 rounds. But eyewitnesses dispute that figure, as does the owner of the adjacent Don Carlos restaurant, who has claimed that &#x201C;thousands of bullet rounds&#x201D; were fired. Could it be that the department&apos;s numbers don&apos;t include shots from its undercover officers? And if the bikers were firing at police, as alleged, why hasn&apos;t the Waco P.D. released any hard evidence to prove it?</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.1y">&#x201C;Harried handgun fights are usually a pretty inaccurate situation,&#x201D; says Cossacks chapter president John Wilson. &#x201C;Head shots happen by mistake, if at all. Someone got lucky. To have that many guys hit with torso shots and head shots&#x2014;in my experience, I would say that indicates you had trained people with long rifles and optical sights. That&apos;s accurate, aimed fire.&#x201D; (3)</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.1z">A rival Bandido, who declined to be named, reached the same conclusion: &#x201C;Seven of the nine [dead] were head shots or chest shots.

Many of the Waco 177 waited days to be provided with a lawyer while the desperate court system sought help from neighboring cities. &#x201C;Like if you were in a fast-food restaurant and three buses pulled up,&#x201D; a local judge named Billy Ray Stubblefield told the <em>Waco Tribune,</em> &#x201C;and all the kids want their food just as fast as they normally do.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.24">It&apos;s still unclear why so many of the bikers were arrested in the first place, when it appears that so few of them were actually involved in the shoot-out. Three bikers were arrested despite arriving <em>after</em> the shooting stopped; Swanton later said it was because they were carrying guns&#x2014;legally, as it later appeared&#x2014;and because they were &#x201C;wearing the colors of criminal gang members.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.25">Swanton, meanwhile, is now trying to parlay his elevated profile into a run for county sheriff.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.26"><strong>Wilson:</strong> We were lined up and zip-tied, had our shoes taken from us and our belts and anything in our pockets.

My wife told him I was on a business trip, because he&apos;s 4 years old and his understanding of going to jail is you&apos;ve done something wrong. We have a minivan, and my wife opened the door, and I was sitting in the backseat. He was surprised and overjoyed and confused all at the same time. The next morning, I had to get back to my job. When he woke up, he was real upset that I wasn&apos;t there. It hit him real heavy. He was thinking I was going to be gone again.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.2h"><strong>Anonymous Cossack #2:</strong> We have one guy that was a United Airlines pilot. For years.

Waco P.D. officer Manuel Chavez later admitted in court that Peterson signed all 177 of the so-called cookie-cutter probable-cause affidavits in bulk, without specifying the evidence against each individual defendant. Peterson, it turns out, is a former state trooper with no legal training.</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.2n">Nevertheless, the Waco 177 still have their work cut out for them. The judge in the case, Matt Johnson, is the former law partner of district attorney Abel Reyna. Incredibly, the foreman of the first grand jury to be convened, James Head, is a Waco P.D. detective. &#x201C;He was chosen totally at random, like the law says,&#x201D; Reyna insisted to local reporters. If this seems brazen, consider that the commission to appoint jurors was originally going to be led by <em>Reyna&apos;s own father</em>. Reyna only backed down under pressure, acquiescing to the process that led to Head&apos;s selection. Asked why he&apos;d permit an active police officer to lead a grand jury investigating possible police misconduct, state district judge Ralph Strother said, &#x201C;I just thought, &#x2018;Well, he&apos;s qualified. He knows the criminal-justice system.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.2o">On his first day as a grand juror, Head wore his badge and service pistol. Later, when a reporter asked him if he&apos;d taken part in the Waco operation, Head responded: &#x201C;Not really.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.2p"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.2q"><em><strong>Nathaniel Penn</strong> is a </em>GQ<em> correspondent.</em></p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.2r">(1) At the request of some interviewees, certain names and/or identifying details have been changed or withheld.  </p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.2s">(2) Bandido or not, this biker has yet to be identified.  </p><p data-reactid=".21i6ah77u9s.1.1.0.0.4.2t">(3) The DPS declined an interview request.
