  	",
  	    "articleBody": "\u0022I cannot change the way I am,\u0022 Julian Niccolini said as he nervously twisted a package of sweetener into a little ball. \u0022I\u0027m a people person. I love people. I\u0027m never gonna change that, even when somebody tells me I\u0027m a terrible human being.\u0022\u000A\u000AWe were seated in the Pool Room of Julian\u0027s legendary Midtown Manhattan restaurant, The Four Seasons, at table 89, a perch from which, at lunchtime, one could take in the entire lustrous panorama of power diners reposed around a shimmering pool of water. A few feet away from us, at a lesser table, Niccolini had himself once sat as a customer.\u000A\u000AIt was 1977 and he was 24 at the time, an Italian émigré working as a waiter in a pricey French restaurant. His co-workers were always belittling the Four Seasons—too big, too impersonal—but he saw potential in its grandeur, in its prime location at the corner of 52nd and Park Avenue, and in its emphasis on seasonal ingredients. That summer night, Julian decided he would like to work at The Four Seasons.\u000A\u000AAnd so the owners hired him to oversee the Grill Room, the cavernous walnut-paneled space down the hall from the Pool Room. Before long, he had helped transform The Four Seasons into the most consequential lunch spot in America—the culinary destination for visiting celebrities, the deal-cutting venue for CEOs. Thirty-eight years later, Julian Niccolini still lorded over the Grill Room and its billionaire habitués like their preening viceroy.\u000A\u000ASoon all of this will change forever. A year from now, the restaurant will be gone, forced from the Seagram Building—the only home it\u0027s known since its creation in 1959—so that the building\u0027s owner, Aby Rosen, can install a restaurant of his own. A year from now, Julian might be a convicted criminal, perhaps done in by his inability to change while the rest of the world changes around him. For this past May, the 62-year-old co-owner is alleged to have assaulted a woman at the bar of the Grill Room—fondling her before she managed to break free and later bring a felony charge against him. To many who have observed his antics over the decades, the episode seemed not only plausible but also metaphoric, further evidence that both The Four Seasons and its frontman belonged to an earlier, brazenly chauvinistic era.\u000A\u000AJulian sees the future quite differently. He intends to be cleared of the criminal charge against him. He also intends to disprove the insinuation that his shelf life as a restaurateur has expired. Julian and his longtime business partner, Alex von Bidder, plan to show that The Four Seasons can flourish elsewhere, even when stripped of its historical grandiosity and thrown into the shark tank of edgier restaurants run by culinary artistes half Julian\u0027s age. \u0022People today want to have fun at restaurants,\u0022 Julian told me. He could adapt, he figured. Fun was his thing. Fun had always been his thing. Maybe people misunderstood this about him—that even his missteps were made in good fun. But he could not change who he was.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ABefore everything changes, you would do well to spend a couple of hours and approximately half your life savings at The Four Seasons. The Grill Room, designed by the famed architects Philip Johnson and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, feels like a hypermasculine cousin of the Library of Congress, all wood and bronze and soundtracked by the low hum of commerce and the gentle swishing of the chain curtains.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest• Julian Niccolini\u0027s bawdy affection for female clients was, for years, shrugged off as an \u0022Italianism.\u0022 NEIL RASMUS/BFA NYC \u000A\u000AEnter and you encounter a white-haired, aquiline-nosed man. This is Julian Niccolini. Since you\u0027re new here, he will glance down at the seating chart and then say to one of the young ladies beside him, \u0022Table 50\u0022—which is one of the eleven tables in Siberia, also known as the terrace, a world away from the titans seated around the twenty-odd tables on the Grill Room\u0027s ground floor. Alternatively, you can book a table for dinner down the hall in the Pool Room, superintended by Alex von Bidder, the steady and discreet superego to Julian\u0027s wisecracking id. Here, around the glittering pool, the transaction is of a different sort; as super-chef David Chang recalled of his first visit, \u0022It looked like the perfect place to close the deal with a date, surrounded by all those silver foxes and beautiful things.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhichever room you choose, you\u0027ll notice two things. First is that the food is exorbitant (over $70 for some entrées) and often lackluster. A wild snapper with corn and guajillo sauce I had at lunch seemed a tired throwback to the nouveau-southwestern craze a couple of decades back. The ahi tuna burger from the bar menu was resoundingly inedible. Such trifles, as even restaurant critics who have consistently praised The Four Seasons acknowledge, are ultimately beside the point. You come here to bask in the spaciousness of what Jackie Onassis liked to call \u0022the cathedral.\u0022 You come to take your rightful place in the pantheon and to be seen occupying that choice real estate. About a thousand faithful Four Seasons customers have a \u0022house account\u0022—meaning the bill typically goes directly to their companies. My old boss, former GQ editor-in-chief Art Cooper, had one such arrangement with The Four Seasons. According to Julian, Art spent about $200,000 a year at his favorite restaurant and never once saw a receipt—all the way up until June of 2003, when he rose from his corner booth, lumbered over to a barstool, succumbed to a stroke, and died at the age of 65.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s the second thing you\u0027ll notice about The Four Seasons: Its clientele is, eh, not youthful. Still, it\u0027s possible to look down from Siberia upon the octo- and nona-genarians and to imagine them as younger, hungrier, Bonfire of the Vanities versions of their present-day selves.\u000A\u000AJulian Niccolini was present at their ascension, and they at his. On the subway to work each morning, he studied the Times, the Daily News, and Women\u0027s Wear Daily to find out which celebrities were in town, what schemes the ultra-wealthy were up to, and who was cavorting with whom. The Grill Room\u0027s seating chart became Julian\u0027s interpretation of America\u0027s pecking order. Even the richest of patrons would come to learn that this was Julian\u0027s roost. As longtime customer Bill White, the CEO of the development firm Constellations Group, puts it, \u0022The Four Seasons is one place where the customer isn\u0027t always right.\u0022\u000A\u000AJulian\u0027s reputation as a host persisted to the point that he was eventually penning columns in Gotham, Details, and the New York Observer, where he\u0027d flatter this or that \u0022beautiful\u0022 customer while gossiping about others (Bethenny Frankel urinating in a wine bucket). He also dispensed wisdom that ranged from the practical (like when to wear a linen suit) to the prurient (like what to do when a woman hits on you when your wife is standing nearby). At least a few uninitiated readers must have wondered just who this pretentious reptile was.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest￼￼￼￼• For its grandeur, Jackie Onassis called The Four Seasons \u0022the cathedral.\u0022 For the clientele it hosted, the restaurant inspired the term \u0022power lunch.\u0022© The New York Times\u000A\u000ABack at the restaurant, of course, the old warhorses roared with appreciation when Julian presided over a lascivious Valentine\u0027s Day menu that included Hanky Panky Veal Shanky and Peek-a-Boo Polenta; or when he distributed wiener appetizers the day Anthony Weiner went down in scandal; or when he reportedly arranged for a woman to approach Vernon Jordan\u0027s table and expose her titanic breasts to him for a solid thirty seconds.\u000A\u000AThe restaurant critic John Mariani wrote in his 1994 book about The Four Seasons that Julian\u0027s \u0022eccentricities were shrugged off as mere Italianisms.\u0022 And Julian—who has been married for the past thirty-three years and has two adult daughters—played his charm for laughs. For instance, in an advice column in 2006, he wrote that while only an idiot would have sex with a co-worker, \u0022sleeping with a client, or customer, of course, is different.\u0022\u000A\u000ATen years later, the joke was stale, dangerously so.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AMaybe the incident that ended in Julian\u0027s arrest had begun, that night in May, in fun. However things started, it certainly seems the young woman saw something dark in the restaurateur\u0027s alleged overtures. It\u0027s equally clear that Julian Niccolini\u0027s bawdy act wasn\u0027t playing as well these days as it had in the past.\u000A\u000AThree months before the alleged assault, The Four Seasons hosted a high-ticket fund-raiser attended by several of the city\u0027s celebrated new chefs and sommeliers. They were uniformly younger than Julian, raised in a different era. They did not flirt with the customers. Did not stare at cleavage. Did not whisper to a male client that the female a few tables away appeared not to be wearing any underwear. They were aware of Julian Niccolini\u0027s reputation as a horndog. But they respected what he had accomplished and were inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.\u000A\u000AStill, that night several of them were appalled as Julian held forth, \u0022saying the most unbelievable shit,\u0022 recalls one attendee. \u0022The stuff that came out of his mouth—three or four references to having sex. ‘It\u0027s like fucking a woman\u0027—that kind of thing. In front of like 300 people. Obviously he\u0027s got a bunch of 60-to-80-year-old guys who think it\u0027s okay to objectify women. But it struck a lot of us as completely out of line. Personally, I wouldn\u0027t let him within a hundred feet of my wife.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat generational divide may have been at play on the evening of May 9, when The Four Seasons hosted a Fête de la Fleur champagne reception followed by a six-course meal with twenty-one tastings of wine. It was reportedly about nine o\u0027clock, and Julian and the young woman—whose father is said to be a former business associate of his—were at the bar. According to the police complaint she later filed, Julian kissed her while pulling her body toward his. When the young woman resisted, the report says, Julian reached into the back of her dress, tore her bra, and then groped her, resulting in scratch marks on her back and a bruise on her hip while he attempted to pull down her stockings. \u0022I am further informed,\u0022 wrote the detective in the report, \u0022that informant repeatedly told defendant to stop and that she was trying to break free of defendant\u0027s hold while he was doing this but that she was unable to.\u0022\u000A\u000AAt a recent Four Seasons soiree, Julian held forth, \u0022saying the most\u000Aunbelievable shit,\u0022 one attendee told me. \u0022Personally, I wouldn\u0027t\u000Alet him within a hundred feet of my wife.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000ATwo days later, she paid a visit to the NYPD Midtown North station. According to the New York Post, the police arranged for her to call Julian while they taped the conversation. In the Post\u0027s account, the Four Seasons co-owner (who, through his attorney, has denied all of the allegations while refusing further comment; the young woman has also fended off media inquiries) apologized to his accuser on the phone while pleading, \u0022Let\u0027s not go any further with this.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe Special Victims Division charged Julian with first-degree sexual abuse, punishable by up to seven years\u0027 imprisonment. He surrendered to the authorities early on the morning of June 3. Julian was freed without bail and before long was back at The Four Seasons and presiding over lunch.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest• Regulars at the power haunt: clockwise from top left, Brendan Gill and Jackie Onassis; Truman Capote and Lee Radziwill; Richard Gere; Andy Warhol; Warren Buffett; Alana and Rod Stewart.\u000A\u000A\u0022Personally, yes, it\u0027s hurt me,\u0022 Julian told me of the suggestion that some would view him as a sexual predator. \u0022It\u0027s very hurtful.\u0022 Friends took to the web to voice their support for Julian. Mauro Maccioni—the son of Sirio Maccioni, owner of one of Manhattan\u0027s other famed power spots, Le Cirque—wrote on Facebook that his friend was \u0022a great Tuscan gentleman.\u0022 The radio entrepreneur Bill O\u0027Shaughnessy—a Four Seasons sultan who loved to engage in off-color ribaldry with Julian—added, \u0022The book on you is that you\u0027re a big flirt…but totally harmless.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022The guy is a flirt. He\u0027s Italian. They like the ladies,\u0022 Bill White told me. \u0022Okay, maybe he had some drinks. But I\u0027m sure it was meant in fun.\u0022\u000A\u000ALess easy to square with their belief that the incident was overblown was the fact that he had faced a somewhat similar accusation in 1991, from an employee who alleged that Julian sexually harassed her throughout her five-year tenure. (That case was settled confidentially, and I was unable to reach her.) I asked a number of longtime female patrons of the restaurant what they made of the charges against Julian. \u0022I did tend to think he was a little too familiar, and maybe having a little too much fun,\u0022 said famed dining critic Gael Greene. \u0022But it didn\u0027t bother me. I\u0027m sorry to say that Julian never tried to seduce me. Probably I should be embarrassed to admit that. Perhaps he thought it best not to attack restaurant critics.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe queen of New York gossip columnists, 92-year-old Liz Smith, has patronized The Four Seasons since it opened, often with the financier Pete Peterson. \u0022Pete found him amusing in the way that teenaged boys find dirty jokes amusing,\u0022 she told me. \u0022I\u0027ve always seen him as one of those guys who wanted to appear that they were having a lot more sex than they actually were. Of course, I\u0027m hopelessly out of date. And I hate to say this, but sometimes I think the world has totally lost its sense of humor. I think women are generally used to men making passes. It would have to be pretty bad for me to go to the police.\u0022\u000A\u000ATo others, it\u0027s a matter of dignity in an industry that\u0027s only recently begun to view women as more than objects of lust. \u0022I don\u0027t know enough about what happened at The Four Seasons,\u0022 Amanda Cohen, the 40-year-old chef/owner of the acclaimed East Village restaurant Dirt Candy, wrote me in an e-mail. \u0022But I\u0027ve been around long enough to see this business change from owners and investors who treated restaurants like their own personal playgrounds to what you have today—which is owners, investors, and chefs who treat it like an office where sexual behavior isn\u0027t tolerated.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Julian never tried to seduce me. Probably I should be embarrassed\u000Ato admit that. Perhaps he thought it best not to attack restaurant\u000Acritics,\u0022 Gael Greene told me.Twitter\u000A\u000AChange happens, and the great institutions are often at pains to adapt. In June, it was reported that a young man entered the Yale Club wearing a T-shirt that read FUCK FOREVER, prompting fulminations from the Old Guard that civilization had reached its nadir. Food &amp; Wine announced its Best Restaurants of the Year, and the sole New York winner was Cosme, a noisy year-old Mexican joint housed in a former strip club.\u000A\u000AI tried to get a table at Cosme, but it was impossible. I also tried to get into Ralph Lauren\u0027s Polo Bar, which attracts celebrities the way The Four Seasons used to—and where Julian recently dined and was later heard to scoff, \u0022Who\u0027s gonna eat at a restaurant in a basement? It won\u0027t last.\u0022 By contrast, when I sought a lunch reservation at The Four Seasons\u0027 Grill Room the following day, OpenTable informed me that there were tables at any time I wished (not mentioning, of course, that I would be seated in Siberia while seats on the main floor awaited its faithful titans).\u000A\u000A\u0022And don\u0027t change a goddamn thing!\u0022 Bill O\u0027Shaughnessy had thundered while toasting The Four Seasons during its fiftieth-anniversary bash. In yanking its lease, Aby Rosen has left the restaurant no choice. But Alex and Julian have decided to make a virtue out of the changes thrust upon them. Julian told me that they\u0027ll likely move downtown, and their new establishment will still be called The Four Seasons, but that it will not be The Four Seasons of old. It might be nice, Julian allowed, to move beyond the ceaseless jockeying for the optimal power table—all that \u0022competition for attention,\u0022 as he put it, \u0022taking all these calls, nonstop.\u0022 It might also be nice to have a more manageable space, not having to serve 300 meals all at once.\u000A\u000A\u0022The future is a much more relaxed atmosphere,\u0022 he said. \u0022People want to go out, have fun, and drink a lot. The food is basically secondary. Of course, The Four Seasons will still have tremendous architecture, incredible service, and great food. But it will be more casual. Because that\u0027s what people want today.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe enthusiasm in his voice was, at best, marginal. Then again, it had been a long twenty-four hours. The previous day, he and others said good-bye to an old Four Seasons mainstay, JPMorgan\u0027s star dealmaker Jimmy Lee, who had died the previous week while exercising at home. Lee was 62, Julian\u0027s age. The place was packed all afternoon and evening with a who\u0027s who of the finance elite, and no one was leaving; everyone was grieving and transacting at the restaurant. A sad day, a very good day—this was how it worked, always, seasons changing yet somehow still the same.\u000A\u000ARobert Draper  is a GQ correspondent.",

I love people. I&apos;m never gonna change that, even when somebody tells me I&apos;m a terrible human being.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.1">We were seated in the Pool Room of Julian&apos;s legendary Midtown Manhattan restaurant, The Four Seasons, at table 89, a perch from which, at lunchtime, one could take in the entire lustrous panorama of power diners reposed around a shimmering pool of water. A few feet away from us, at a lesser table, Niccolini had himself once sat as a customer.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.2">It was 1977 and he was 24 at the time, an Italian &#xE9;migr&#xE9; working as a waiter in a pricey French restaurant. His co-workers were always belittling the Four Seasons&#x2014;too big, too impersonal&#x2014;but he saw potential in its grandeur, in its prime location at the corner of 52nd and Park Avenue, and in its emphasis on seasonal ingredients. That summer night, Julian decided he would like to work at The Four Seasons.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.3">And so the owners hired him to oversee the Grill Room, the cavernous walnut-paneled space down the hall from the Pool Room. Before long, he had helped transform The Four Seasons into the most consequential lunch spot in America&#x2014;the culinary destination for visiting celebrities, the deal-cutting venue for CEOs. Thirty-eight years later, Julian Niccolini still lorded over the Grill Room and its billionaire habitu&#xE9;s like their preening viceroy.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.5">Soon all of this will change forever. A year from now, the restaurant will be gone, forced from the Seagram Building&#x2014;the only home it&apos;s known since its creation in 1959&#x2014;so that the building&apos;s owner, Aby Rosen, can install a restaurant of his own. A year from now, Julian might be a convicted criminal, perhaps done in by his inability to change while the rest of the world changes around him. For this past May, the 62-year-old co-owner is alleged to have assaulted a woman at the bar of the Grill Room&#x2014;fondling her before she managed to break free and later bring a felony charge against him. To many who have observed his antics over the decades, the episode seemed not only plausible but also metaphoric, further evidence that both The Four Seasons and its frontman belonged to an earlier, brazenly chauvinistic era.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.6">Julian sees the future quite differently. He intends to be cleared of the criminal charge against him. He also intends to disprove the insinuation that his shelf life as a restaurateur has expired. Julian and his longtime business partner, Alex von Bidder, plan to show that The Four Seasons can flourish elsewhere, even when stripped of its historical grandiosity and thrown into the shark tank of edgier restaurants run by culinary artistes half Julian&apos;s age. &#x201C;People today want to have fun at restaurants,&#x201D; Julian told me. He could adapt, he figured. Fun was his thing. Fun had always been his thing. Maybe people misunderstood this about him&#x2014;that even his missteps were made in good fun. But he could not change who he was.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.7"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Before everything</strong> changes, you would do well to spend a couple of hours and approximately half your life savings at The Four Seasons. The Grill Room, designed by the famed architects Philip Johnson and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, feels like a hypermasculine cousin of the Library of Congress, all wood and bronze and soundtracked by the low hum of commerce and the gentle swishing of the chain curtains.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.9"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55e5bf2ce4fe554f30880bdb/master/w_806/powerlunch-GQ-2015-02.jpg" alt="powerlunch-GQ-2015-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;t=powerlunch-GQ-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;t=powerlunch-GQ-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55e5bf2ce4fe554f30880bdb%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpowerlunch-GQ-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=powerlunch-GQ-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55e5bf2ce4fe554f30880bdb%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpowerlunch-GQ-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=powerlunch-GQ-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>&#x2022; Julian Niccolini&#x2019;s bawdy affection for female clients was, for years, shrugged off as an &#x201C;Italianism.&#x201D;</p></span><div class="credits"> NEIL RASMUS/BFA NYC </div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.a">Enter and you encounter a white-haired, aquiline-nosed man. This is Julian Niccolini. Since you&apos;re new here, he will glance down at the seating chart and then say to one of the young ladies beside him, &#x201C;Table 50&#x201D;&#x2014;which is one of the eleven tables in Siberia, also known as the terrace, a world away from the titans seated around the twenty-odd tables on the Grill Room&apos;s ground floor. Alternatively, you can book a table for dinner down the hall in the Pool Room, superintended by Alex von Bidder, the steady and discreet superego to Julian&apos;s wisecracking id. Here, around the glittering pool, the transaction is of a different sort; as super-chef David Chang recalled of his first visit, &#x201C;It looked like the perfect place to close the deal with a date, surrounded by all those silver foxes and beautiful things.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.b">Whichever room you choose, you&apos;ll notice two things. First is that the food is exorbitant (over $70 for some entr&#xE9;es) and often lackluster. A wild snapper with corn and guajillo sauce I had at lunch seemed a tired throwback to the nouveau-southwestern craze a couple of decades back. The ahi tuna burger from the bar menu was resoundingly inedible. Such trifles, as even restaurant critics who have consistently praised The Four Seasons acknowledge, are ultimately beside the point. You come here to bask in the spaciousness of what Jackie Onassis liked to call &#x201C;the cathedral.&#x201D; You come to take your rightful place in the pantheon and to be seen occupying that choice real estate. About a thousand faithful Four Seasons customers have a &#x201C;house account&#x201D;&#x2014;meaning the bill typically goes directly to their companies. My old boss, former <em>GQ</em> editor-in-chief Art Cooper, had one such arrangement with The Four Seasons. According to Julian, Art spent about $200,000 a year at his favorite restaurant and never once saw a receipt&#x2014;all the way up until June of 2003, when he rose from his corner booth, lumbered over to a barstool, succumbed to a stroke, and died at the age of 65.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.c">That&apos;s the second thing you&apos;ll notice about The Four Seasons: Its clientele is, eh, not youthful. Still, it&apos;s possible to look down from Siberia upon the octo- and nona-genarians and to imagine them as younger, hungrier, <em>Bonfire of the Vanities</em> versions of their present-day selves.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.d">Julian Niccolini was present at their ascension, and they at his. On the subway to work each morning, he studied the <em>Times,</em> the <em>Daily News,</em> and <em>Women&apos;s Wear Daily</em> to find out which celebrities were in town, what schemes the ultra-wealthy were up to, and who was cavorting with whom. The Grill Room&apos;s seating chart became Julian&apos;s interpretation of America&apos;s pecking order. Even the richest of patrons would come to learn that this was Julian&apos;s roost. As longtime customer Bill White, the CEO of the development firm Constellations Group, puts it, &#x201C;The Four Seasons is one place where the customer isn&apos;t always right.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.e">Julian&apos;s reputation as a host persisted to the point that he was eventually penning columns in <em>Gotham, Details,</em> and the <em>New York Observer,</em> where he&apos;d flatter this or that &#x201C;beautiful&#x201D; customer while gossiping about others (Bethenny Frankel urinating in a wine bucket). He also dispensed wisdom that ranged from the practical (like when to wear a linen suit) to the prurient (like what to do when a woman hits on you when your wife is standing nearby). At least a few uninitiated readers must have wondered just who this pretentious reptile was.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.f"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55e5c1b1e4fe554f30880bfd/master/w_806/powerlunch-GQ-2015-03.jpg" alt="powerlunch-GQ-2015-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;t=powerlunch-GQ-2015-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;t=powerlunch-GQ-2015-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55e5c1b1e4fe554f30880bfd%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpowerlunch-GQ-2015-03.jpg&amp;description=powerlunch-GQ-2015-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55e5c1b1e4fe554f30880bfd%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpowerlunch-GQ-2015-03.jpg&amp;description=powerlunch-GQ-2015-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#xFFFC;&#x2022; For its grandeur, Jackie Onassis called The Four Seasons &#x201C;the cathedral.&#x201D; For the clientele it hosted, the restaurant inspired the term &#x201C;power lunch.&#x201D;</p></span><div class="credits">&#xA9; The New York Times</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.g">Back at the restaurant, of course, the old warhorses roared with appreciation when Julian presided over a lascivious Valentine&apos;s Day menu that included Hanky Panky Veal Shanky and Peek-a-Boo Polenta; or when he distributed wiener appetizers the day Anthony Weiner went down in scandal; or when he reportedly arranged for a woman to approach Vernon Jordan&apos;s table and expose her titanic breasts to him for a solid thirty seconds.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.h">The restaurant critic John Mariani wrote in his 1994 book about The Four Seasons that Julian&apos;s &#x201C;eccentricities were shrugged off as mere Italianisms.&#x201D; And Julian&#x2014;who has been married for the past thirty-three years and has two adult daughters&#x2014;played his charm for laughs. For instance, in an advice column in 2006, he wrote that while only an idiot would have sex with a co-worker, &#x201C;sleeping with a client, or customer, of course, is different.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.i">Ten years later, the joke was stale, dangerously so.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.j"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Maybe the incident</strong> that ended in Julian&apos;s arrest had begun, that night in May, in fun. However things started, it certainly seems the young woman saw something dark in the restaurateur&apos;s alleged overtures. It&apos;s equally clear that Julian Niccolini&apos;s bawdy act wasn&apos;t playing as well these days as it had in the past.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.l">Three months before the alleged assault, The Four Seasons hosted a high-ticket fund-raiser attended by several of the city&apos;s celebrated new chefs and sommeliers. They were uniformly younger than Julian, raised in a different era. They did not flirt with the customers. Did not stare at cleavage. Did not whisper to a male client that the female a few tables away appeared not to be wearing any underwear. They were aware of Julian Niccolini&apos;s reputation as a horndog. But they respected what he had accomplished and were inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.m">Still, that night several of them were appalled as Julian held forth, &#x201C;saying the most unbelievable shit,&#x201D; recalls one attendee. &#x201C;The stuff that came out of his mouth&#x2014;three or four references to having sex. &#x2018;It&apos;s like fucking a woman&#x2019;&#x2014;that kind of thing. In front of like 300 people. Obviously he&apos;s got a bunch of 60-to-80-year-old guys who think it&apos;s okay to objectify women. But it struck a lot of us as completely out of line. Personally, I wouldn&apos;t let him within a hundred feet of my wife.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.n">That generational divide may have been at play on the evening of May 9, when The Four Seasons hosted a F&#xEA;te de la Fleur champagne reception followed by a six-course meal with twenty-one tastings of wine. It was reportedly about nine o&apos;clock, and Julian and the young woman&#x2014;whose father is said to be a former business associate of his&#x2014;were at the bar. According to the police complaint she later filed, Julian kissed her while pulling her body toward his. When the young woman resisted, the report says, Julian reached into the back of her dress, tore her bra, and then groped her, resulting in scratch marks on her back and a bruise on her hip while he attempted to pull down her stockings. &#x201C;I am further informed,&#x201D; wrote the detective in the report, &#x201C;that informant repeatedly told defendant to stop and that she was trying to break free of defendant&apos;s hold while he was doing this but that she was unable to.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.o"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>At a recent Four Seasons soiree, Julian held forth, &#x201C;saying the most

According to the <em>New York Post,</em> the police arranged for her to call Julian while they taped the conversation. In the <em>Post&apos;</em>s account, the Four Seasons co-owner (who, through his attorney, has denied all of the allegations while refusing further comment; the young woman has also fended off media inquiries) apologized to his accuser on the phone while pleading, &#x201C;Let&apos;s not go any further with this.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.q">The Special Victims Division charged Julian with first-degree sexual abuse, punishable by up to seven years&apos; imprisonment. He surrendered to the authorities early on the morning of June 3. Julian was freed without bail and before long was back at The Four Seasons and presiding over lunch.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.r"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55e5bd3c89c0d3e261b1ab18/master/w_806/6 Image Power Lunch.jpg" alt="6 Image Power Lunch.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;t=6%20Image%20Power%20Lunch.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;t=6%20Image%20Power%20Lunch.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55e5bd3c89c0d3e261b1ab18%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2F6%20Image%20Power%20Lunch.jpg&amp;description=6%20Image%20Power%20Lunch.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpower-lunch-four-seasons&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55e5bd3c89c0d3e261b1ab18%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2F6%20Image%20Power%20Lunch.jpg&amp;description=6%20Image%20Power%20Lunch.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>&#x2022; Regulars at the power haunt: <em>clockwise from top left</em>, Brendan Gill and Jackie Onassis; Truman Capote and Lee Radziwill; Richard Gere; Andy Warhol; Warren Buffett; Alana and Rod Stewart.</p></span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.s">&#x201C;Personally, yes, it&apos;s hurt me,&#x201D; Julian told me of the suggestion that some would view him as a sexual predator. &#x201C;It&apos;s very hurtful.&#x201D; Friends took to the web to voice their support for Julian. Mauro Maccioni&#x2014;the son of Sirio Maccioni, owner of one of Manhattan&apos;s other famed power spots, Le Cirque&#x2014;wrote on Facebook that his friend was &#x201C;a great Tuscan gentleman.&#x201D; The radio entrepreneur Bill O&apos;Shaughnessy&#x2014;a Four Seasons sultan who loved to engage in off-color ribaldry with Julian&#x2014;added, &#x201C;The book on you is that you&apos;re a big flirt&#x2026;but totally harmless.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.t">&#x201C;The guy is a flirt. He&apos;s Italian. They like the ladies,&#x201D; Bill White told me. &#x201C;Okay, maybe he had some drinks. But I&apos;m sure it was meant in fun.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.u">Less easy to square with their belief that the incident was overblown was the fact that he had faced a somewhat similar accusation in 1991, from an employee who alleged that Julian sexually harassed her throughout her five-year tenure. (That case was settled confidentially, and I was unable to reach her.) I asked a number of longtime female patrons of the restaurant what they made of the charges against Julian. &#x201C;I did tend to think he was a little too familiar, and maybe having a little too much fun,&#x201D; said famed dining critic Gael Greene. &#x201C;But it didn&apos;t bother me. I&apos;m sorry to say that Julian never tried to seduce me. Probably I should be embarrassed to admit that. Perhaps he thought it best not to attack restaurant critics.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.v">The queen of New York gossip columnists, 92-year-old Liz Smith, has patronized The Four Seasons since it opened, often with the financier Pete Peterson. &#x201C;Pete found him amusing in the way that teenaged boys find dirty jokes amusing,&#x201D; she told me. &#x201C;I&apos;ve always seen him as one of those guys who wanted to appear that they were having a lot more sex than they actually were. Of course, I&apos;m hopelessly out of date. And I hate to say this, but sometimes I think the world has totally lost its sense of humor. I think women are generally used to men making passes. It would have to be pretty bad for me to go to the police.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.w">To others, it&apos;s a matter of dignity in an industry that&apos;s only recently begun to view women as more than objects of lust. &#x201C;I don&apos;t know enough about what happened at The Four Seasons,&#x201D; Amanda Cohen, the 40-year-old chef/owner of the acclaimed East Village restaurant Dirt Candy, wrote me in an e-mail. &#x201C;But I&apos;ve been around long enough to see this business change from owners and investors who treated restaurants like their own personal playgrounds to what you have today&#x2014;which is owners, investors, and chefs who treat it like an office where sexual behavior isn&apos;t tolerated.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.x"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&#x201C;Julian never tried to seduce me.

In June, it was reported that a young man entered the Yale Club wearing a T-shirt that read FUCK FOREVER, prompting fulminations from the Old Guard that civilization had reached its nadir. <em>Food &amp; Wine</em> announced its Best Restaurants of the Year, and the sole New York winner was Cosme, a noisy year-old Mexican joint housed in a former strip club.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.z">I tried to get a table at Cosme, but it was impossible. I also tried to get into Ralph Lauren&apos;s Polo Bar, which attracts celebrities the way The Four Seasons used to&#x2014;and where Julian recently dined and was later heard to scoff, &#x201C;Who&apos;s gonna eat at a restaurant in a basement? It won&apos;t last.&#x201D; By contrast, when I sought a lunch reservation at The Four Seasons&apos; Grill Room the following day, OpenTable informed me that there were tables at any time I wished (not mentioning, of course, that I would be seated in Siberia while seats on the main floor awaited its faithful titans).</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.10">&#x201C;And don&apos;t change a goddamn thing!&#x201D; Bill O&apos;Shaughnessy had thundered while toasting The Four Seasons during its fiftieth-anniversary bash. In yanking its lease, Aby Rosen has left the restaurant no choice. But Alex and Julian have decided to make a virtue out of the changes thrust upon them. Julian told me that they&apos;ll likely move downtown, and their new establishment will still be called The Four Seasons, but that it will not be The Four Seasons of old. It might be nice, Julian allowed, to move beyond the ceaseless jockeying for the optimal power table&#x2014;all that &#x201C;competition for attention,&#x201D; as he put it, &#x201C;taking all these calls, nonstop.&#x201D; It might also be nice to have a more manageable space, not having to serve 300 meals all at once.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.11">&#x201C;The future is a much more relaxed atmosphere,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;People want to go out, have fun, and drink a lot. The food is basically secondary. Of course, The Four Seasons will still have tremendous architecture, incredible service, and great food. But it will be more casual. Because that&apos;s what people want today.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.12">The enthusiasm in his voice was, at best, marginal. Then again, it had been a long twenty-four hours. The previous day, he and others said good-bye to an old Four Seasons mainstay, JPMorgan&apos;s star dealmaker Jimmy Lee, who had died the previous week while exercising at home. Lee was 62, Julian&apos;s age. The place was packed all afternoon and evening with a who&apos;s who of the finance elite, and no one was leaving; everyone was grieving and transacting at the restaurant. A sad day, a very good day&#x2014;this was how it worked, always, seasons changing yet somehow still the same.</p><p data-reactid=".cbvcdhydxc.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>Robert Draper</strong> <em> is a
