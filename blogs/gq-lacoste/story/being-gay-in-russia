If you\u0027re young and queer and hopeful, it\u0027s the happiest way to end a weekend. An actual tea party. There are also cookies and—at LaSky, the HIV-awareness center that often hosts the event—more brightly colored giant beanbags than chairs, plus a lot of posters of hunky bare-chested men with floppy hair. There are many, many rainbows, on stickers and pins and brochures, and a rainbow curtain covering a strange little door in the corner.\u000A\u000A The door leads to a club called Bunker, which is really a maze, twisting through the rest of the building\u0027s vast basement. It\u0027s dark; you have to feel your way through. The men who go to Bunker—many or maybe most of them \u0022straight\u0022 men, married men, says the bartender—are looking for bodies, not faces. They don\u0027t want to see or be seen, only to touch and to be touched in a place where nobody knows them.\u000A\u000AThose are the choices: light or dark, tea or poppers, a well-lit game of charades or a grope in the dungeon. Sweet or sordid, it doesn\u0027t matter: In Russia now—in the throes of a fever stoked by the Kremlin—both must be hidden. They are not hidden well enough.\u000A\u000AOne evening in November—the city center like a bowl of pastel candies, Orthodox onion-domes rising above it like spun sugar—two strangers found their way to LaSky. They walked down a long street between a busy road and a canal until they came to an arch in a building. They went through the arch and down a dark alley before they arrived at an unlit empty parking lot, blacktop crumbling. Here they may have stopped to put on their masks. They crossed the lot toward a stand of scrub trees and weeds and took a left down a narrow path, then down an even darker set of uneven stairs to an unmarked steel door. The strangers stood at the threshold.\u000A\u000AIt was Rainbow Tea Party night. A woman named Anna asked who was there. \u0022We\u0027re looking for our friend!\u0022 replied one of the strangers. They shoved past her. In the hall, a man named Dmitry Chizhevsky was looking for his jacket. Behind him was a girl I\u0027ll call Rose, a few weeks shy of her eighteenth birthday. Rose glanced toward the door: two men wearing ski masks. \u0022Then,\u0022 she says, \u0022they started shooting.\u0022 Chizhevsky: \u0022The first bullet came into my eye. The first, the very first.\u0022 Rose: \u0022I had a thought in my head—maybe I should do something, maybe I should scream.\u0022 Chizhevsky: \u0022I can remember more closely what was audio.\u0022 Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, he recalls hearing. Five, he thinks. He says he remembers the sound of the bullet hitting his eye.\u000A\u000ADmitry went down, and Rose ran, and Dmitry crawled. The men followed, kicking. One of them had a bat, \u0022a baseball bat, yes,\u0022 says Dmitry. They were screaming. \u0022Faggot, faggot, faggot.\u0022 The bat came down. And then the faggots in the other room charged the men with the gun and the bat and the masks, and the men ran away. Dmitry and Anna, who\u0027d been shot in the back, inspected their wounds. An air gun, they determined. Thank God.\u000A\u000AThey say you can shoot an eye out with an air gun, but that\u0027s not exactly what happened. The pellet, a round metal ball, lodged behind Dmitry\u0027s eye.\u000A\u000A\u0022They tried with a magnet to take it out,\u0022 says Dmitry. \u0022But, uh, they failed.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat did they try next?\u000A\u000A\u0022A hook.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe doctors told him he was lucky; a little farther, it would have entered his brain. All he\u0027d lose would be his vision.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI went to Moscow and St. Petersburg for two weeks in November because the Olympics were coming to Russia, and for a brief moment it seemed possible that the outside world was interested in the unraveling of civil society in one of the most powerful countries on the globe. Books are being banned—Burroughs and Baudelaire and Huxley\u0027s Brave New World—immigrants hunted, journalists killed, a riot-grrrl band, Pussy Riot, imprisoned for almost two years for playing a \u0022Punk Prayer\u0022 in a Moscow cathedral; blasphemy is now illegal. Civil society isn\u0027t just coming undone; it\u0027s imploding. I wanted to visit the bottom of the heap. The golubye. The blues, which in Russia is another word for queer—any way of being other than \u0022Russian,\u0022 which, under President Vladimir Putin, has become a kind of sexual orientation. I wanted to see what ordinary LGBT life was like in a nation whose leaders have decided that \u0022homosexualism\u0022 is a threat to its \u0022sexual sovereignty,\u0022 that \u0022genderless tolerance,\u0022 in Putin\u0027s words, is a disease of the West that Russia will cure. The medicine is that of \u0022traditional values,\u0022 a phrase, ironically, imported from the West, grafted onto a deeply conformist strain of nationalism. In Russia, that means silence and violence, censorship, and in its shadow, much worse.\u000A\u000AOne of the first men I met was Alex, a gay police officer who\u0027d recently quit his job rather than enforce Russia\u0027s new anti-gay law. He wasn\u0027t always so principled: One of Alex\u0027s early assignments on the force was snooping through a fellow officer\u0027s computer for evidence of homosexuality. \u0022I was just lucky it wasn\u0027t my computer,\u0022 Alex said one night at a café on Arbat Street, Moscow\u0027s main thoroughfare of consumer hipsterism.\u000A\u000AHis boyfriend wasn\u0027t as glib: \u0022It\u0027s Germany in the \u002730s,\u0022 he declared. \u0022Hush, hush,\u0022 Alex said. \u0022Not so loud.\u0022 It\u0027s not Germany in the \u002730s, he said; it\u0027s Russia now. And that\u0027s a subtler problem.\u000A\u000AYes, there are killings. In May, a 23-year-old man in Volgograd allegedly came out to a group of friends, who raped him with beer bottles and smashed his skull in with a stone; and in June a group of friends in Kamchatka kicked and stabbed to death a 39-year-old gay man, then burned the body. There\u0027s a national network called Occupy Pedophilia, whose members torture gay men and post hugely popular videos of their \u0022interrogations\u0022 online. There are countless smaller, bristling movements, with names presumptuous (God\u0027s Will) or absurd (Homophobic Wolf). There are babushkas who throw stones, and priests who bless the stones, and police who arrest their victims.\u000A\u000ABut such people exist everywhere, said Alex. The difference in Russia now is who\u0027s standing behind them.\u000A\u000AThe Russian closet has always been deep, but since last June, when the Duma began passing laws designed to shove Russia\u0027s tiny out population back into it, the closet has been getting darker. The first law banned gay \u0022propaganda,\u0022 but it was written so as to leave the definition vague. It\u0027s a mechanism of thought control, its target not so much gays as anybody the state declares gay; a virtual resurrection of Article 70 from the old Soviet system, forbidding \u0022anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.\u0022 Then, as now, nobody knew exactly what \u0022propaganda\u0022 was. The new law explicitly forbids any suggestion that queer love is equal to that of heterosexuals, but what constitutes such a suggestion? One man was charged for holding up a sign that said being gay is ok. Pride parades are out of the question, a pink triangle enough to get you arrested, if not beaten. A couple holding hands could be accused of propaganda if they do so where a minor might see them; the law, as framed, is all about protecting the children. Yelena Mizulina, chair of the Duma Committee on Family, Women, and Children\u0027s Affairs and the author of the bill, says that it\u0027s too late to save adult \u0022homosexualists,\u0022 as they\u0027re called, but Russia still has a chance to raise a pure generation.\u000A\u000AMizulina\u0027s dream isn\u0027t old-fashioned; it is, as one fascist supporter told me, \u0022utopian.\u0022 He meant that as praise. And the Russian dream is not alone. Liberal Americans imagine LGBT rights as slowly but surely marching forward. But queer rights don\u0027t advance along a straight line. In Russia and throughout Eastern Europe—and in India and in Australia, in a belt across Central Africa—anti-gay crusaders are developing new laws and sharpening old ones. The ideas, meanwhile, are American: the rhetoric of \u0022family values\u0022 churned out by right-wing American think tanks, bizarre statistics to prove that evil is a fact, its face a gay one. This hatred is old venom, but its weaponization by nations as a means with which to fight \u0022globalization\u0022—not the economic kind, the human-rights kind—is a new terror.\u000A\u000A In Russia, the process is accelerating. In 2006, a bill similar to the law was laughed out of the Duma, dismissed by the then deputy prime minister as \u0022a row of mistakes.\u0022 In June it passed, 436-0. Alex the cop says 2010 was the best year, a new club or café opening every other weekend. New LGBT groups were forming all over. \u0022It was like a party,\u0022 one activist told me. What happened between then and now has as much to do with the unstable price of oil and Putin\u0027s eroding popular support as it does with actual queer people. The less prosperity Putin can deliver, the more he speaks of holy Russian empire, language to which the Russian Orthodox Church thrills. Putin, says Patriarch Kirill, the church\u0027s leader, is a living \u0022act of God.\u0022 Forget about the price of bread and what you can\u0027t afford. Putin has come to save the Russian soul.\u000A\u000AArticle 6.21, the law\u0027s official designation, has proven to be the Duma\u0027s most popular social initiative of the year; according to one poll, only 7 percent of Russians firmly oppose it. Another new law requiring nonprofits that receive support outside Russia to register as foreign agents has been used to justify police raids on the country\u0027s leading LGBT organizations. In July, Putin signed a law banning the adoption of Russian children by gay parents abroad.\u000A\u000AAnd in October, the Duma started to take up a law to remove children from LGBT parents in Russia. It\u0027s been put on hold, but it\u0027s expected to return once the Olympics and international scrutiny have passed.\u000A\u000A\u0022The problem is bigger than laws,\u0022 a gay activist named Igor Iasine told me, tracing a line through his beard where neo-Nazis had broken his jaw. \u0022The law is icing on the cake.\u0022\u000A\u000AFor Dmitry Kiselyov, the director of Russia\u0027s massive new state media corporation—created in December to swallow up state media entities that show any hint of autonomy—laws are not enough. He\u0027s concerned about organ donors, the possibility of a queer heart beating in a straight body.\u000A\u000AWhen homosexuals die, he says, \u0022their hearts should be burned.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022I haven\u0027t heard__ of these laws, but I think it\u0027s fine,\u0022 a kid named Kirill tells me at a hidden gay club called Secrets. \u0022We don\u0027t need gay pride here. Why do we need to show our orientation?\u0022 He shrugs. He has heard of the torture videos popular online, the gangs that kidnap gays, the police that arrest gays, the babushkas with their eggs and their stones. But he hasn\u0027t seen them. He prefers not to. \u0022Everybody wants to emigrate, but not me.\u0022 He shrugs again; it\u0027s like a tic. \u0022I love Russia. This is their experience, not mine.\u0022 He says he does not know what the word closet means.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022Something Is Coming\u0022\u000A\u000AIn an upper-middle-class neighborhood close to Moscow\u0027s city center, two apartments face each other. Two families, two daughters. They leave the doors open to allow easy access from one to the other.\u000A\u000APavel 1  met Irina not long after he moved to Moscow twelve years ago, and almost immediately he knew that someday he\u0027d start a family with her. Irina felt it, too. They agreed on it one night over vodka, after a night of clubbing. The party had moved back to an apartment, where they kept drinking, Irina teasing Pavel, Pavel marveling at Irina\u0027s bold friends. She was a Muscovite; Pavel had come from one of those distant eastern cities, 4,000 miles from Moscow. Irina was six years younger, but she was his teacher, teaching him how to be silly and modern and free. They drank and danced, Pavel discovering his hips, until they both collapsed around a kitchen table and, over more vodka, Pavel tried to be funny and Irina thought he was, so she said, \u0022Someday I would like to have a child with you.\u0022 Pavel said, \u0022I feel the same.\u0022\u000A\u000ASuddenly they were sober, giddy but clear: They knew it was true. But they had to wait. To have children is a great responsibility, Pavel thought. You have to have a place to live. You have to earn. You have to have a partner you can rely on. In 2010, they were ready. Their best friends, Nik and Zoya, were having a baby, too, and they lived right next door. Their children would grow up together. Two little girls: Nik and Zoya\u0027s Kristina, and then Pavel and Irina\u0027s Emma.\u000A\u000ANow they are one big happy family, inseparable. Pavel has always been great with kids. He likes to read the girls Russian fairy tales, and he buys DVDs of old Russian cartoons, the ones he was raised on. They watch them together. The girls toddle between the apartments through the open doors. Pavel thinks little blonde Kristina looks like an angel. Emma\u0027s darker, serious like her father. Both girls call him Papa. The children share a nanny, too, who helps the parents with light cleaning, dishes, and dusting, making sure all the family pictures are in place.\u000A\u000A\u0022Nobody would suspect us,\u0022 Pavel says. Not even the nanny.\u000A\u000APavel\u0027s secret isn\u0027t that he\u0027s gay. It\u0027s that they all are, the adults: Pavel and Nik and Irina and Zoya. Both girls have two mothers, two fathers; they have beds in both apartments. Their life together was, until recently, the fulfillment of all that Pavel had wanted, an ambition that had come to him at almost the same moment he\u0027d realized he was gay: to be \u0022normal.\u0022 If he were normal, he thought, then he could be a father. \u0022That,\u0022 he tells me, \u0022has been my precious dream.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000APavel agrees to talk to me because soon, he fears, the laws that have passed and the laws to come may make it impossible to hide. I\u0027m told to meet him at a metro station. When I arrive—with my translator, Zhenya, a gay activist—no one is there. A phone call from a mutual friend directs us through the empty station, around a corner, and down some stairs to a basement restaurant, Georgian cuisine, a man in a corner with a bottle of white wine. Is this—? Yes. He smiles. We sit down.\u000A\u000A\u0022Something is coming,\u0022 says Pavel. What it will be, he\u0027s not sure. He\u0027s worried about \u0022special departments\u0022 in local police stations, dedicated to removing children from gay homes. He\u0027s worried about a co-worker discovering him. He is worried about blackmail. He is worried, and he does not know what else to do. He wishes he could fight, but he doesn\u0027t know how. Sign a petition? March in a parade? Pavel would never do that now. \u0022My children,\u0022 he murmurs.\u000A\u000A\u0022This law,\u0022 he says, referring to the ban on \u0022propaganda.\u0022 \u0022If something happens, it touches only me. And I can protect myself.\u0022 But the next law: \u0022This is about my child. My baby.\u0022 If the next law passes, they will leave. The two women are doctors and Nik works in higher education, careers that will require new certification. Which means that only Pavel, a manager for the state oil company, will be able to work right away. They will be poor, but they will leave. They might have to separate, Pavel and Irina and Emma to Israel, where Irina can become a citizen, Nik and Zoya and Kristina to any country that will take them. They might have to become the couples they pretend to be. For now, they are staying. \u0022We\u0027re going to teach them,\u0022 he says of his two little girls, Emma and Kristina. \u0022How to protect themselves. How to keep silence.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis is how the law really works: It\u0027s the little things that break first. Like a child who wants to call her father Papa. \u0022Father can be only one,\u0022 Pavel tells Kristina. She can never call him Papa again. If someone overheard her... No, not even at home. She must forget that was ever his name. \u0022I can be anybody but Father,\u0022 he tells the girl he used to call daughter.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AA Dangerous Pride\u000A\u000AIn 2006, an activist named Nikolai Alekseyev organized Russia\u0027s first pride parade. Moscow\u0027s mayor forbade it; he called for \u0022concrete measures\u0022 to stop it. On May 27, Alekseyev and a few comrades approached Russia\u0027s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with flowers. The tomb is a memorial to the millions of Soviet troops killed in what Russians call the \u0022war against fascism.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe little group found the gate closed. Before it stood a line of police and squads of the OMON, elite riot cops in boots and blue camo and black berets. And a crowd, chanting, \u0022Russia without faggots!\u0022 One man, in a fit of apparent generosity, screamed, \u0022You have your nightclubs!\u0022 Another began shouting about his grandfather, who had fought in the war. Alekseyev shouted back that his own grandfather died fighting. Then the police arrested Alekseyev, and the crowd took the others, and the Tomb was preserved, safe from gay roses.\u000A\u000AIn 2007, about three dozen pride marchers tried to deliver a letter signed by more than forty members of the European Parliament to the mayor of Moscow, asking for permission to hold the parade. The mayor called it a \u0022work of Satan.\u0022 Among those beaten was an Italian parliamentarian.\u000A\u000AIn 2008, activists applied to hold marches across the city, all denied, and then assembled as a flash mob for moments in front of a statue of Tchaikovsky.\u000A\u000AThey tried the same trick in 2009, but the police were ready.\u000A\u000A2010: Success! Thirty marchers marched for ten minutes before they were captured.\u000A\u000A2011: Three minutes, maybe four.\u000A\u000A2012: Moscow officially banned gay-pride parades for one hundred years.\u000A\u000ALast year: The police were waiting. They brought trucks fitted with metal cages.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAt Bunker one night, a fat man named Yuri, pink-cheeked and furry-chested, leans in close, over my notebook. Not threatening; frightened. \u0022No more parades!\u0022 he says. \u0022No more marches!\u0022 Yes, he would like to have rights. \u0022But this is Russia!\u0022 He\u0027s shaking an open palm on either side of my face, making sure I write this down: \u0022I will be beaten!\u0022 He points to a teenager. \u0022He will be beaten. All of us will be beaten! And we will go to the police, and they will just smile.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AElena Kostyuchenko knew she would be beaten. It was how hard she went down that surprised her. Not immediately. When the fist connected with her skull, she fell, yes, but then she stood again and raised her rainbow flag. The crowd was silent. Their mouths were open as if screaming, but there was no sound. Her hearing was gone. Then the police grabbed her, and Elena\u0027s first gay-pride parade was over.\u000A\u000AElena is 27. \u0022I\u0027m not very tall; I weigh fifty kilos. I can\u0027t overthrow this world,\u0022 she says. But she is trying. It took months, hospitalizations, five medications \u0022to widen the veins in my brain,\u0022 but most of her hearing is back now, and there\u0027s an app on her computer that allows her to jack movies up to 150 percent of what you might consider tolerable volume. She wears her hair in a short black shag with high spiky bangs, and she has big pale blue eyes that lighten in to the pupils. Her voice is droll, her manner deadpan, her presence at first unassuming; I talked to her for a couple of hours before I learned how much violence she\u0027s endured since that first pride event in \u002711, and she never did get around to telling me that when she was 9 she was given up for dead, warehoused in a cancer ward for kids her provincial hospital deemed \u0022unlikely\u0022 to survive.\u000A\u000AShe and Zhenya and I meet at a dull little café near her metro station. Grayish pink walls, two TV screens playing Western pop videos from the \u002780s and \u002790s—there\u0027s a lot of Wham!—and a fluorescent-lit smog of cigarette smoke. Elena\u0027s a reporter, hard-nosed. \u0022Prostitutes, addicts, these are my people,\u0022 she says. She has fainting spells, but she wills herself to keep standing: \u0022A journalist shouldn\u0027t faint.\u0022 In the nine years she\u0027s been working for her paper, Novaya Gazeta—the last major opposition publication—three of its reporters have been murdered, including Anna Politkovskaya, shot four times in her apartment elevator in 2006, the killer still unknown. \u0022I\u0027m lucky,\u0022 Elena says. She means alive.\u000A\u000AShe knows some English, but she speaks mostly in Russian. Explaining her view of Russia\u0027s rising homophobia, she dictates to Zhenya: \u0022Putin needs external enemies and internal enemies. The external enemies are the U.S. and Europe. Internal enemies, they had to think about. The ethnic topic is dangerous. Two wars in the Caucasus, a third one, nobody knows how it would end. Jews? After Hitler, it\u0027s not kosher. We—\u0022 she waves a hand at herself and Zhenya—\u0022are the ideal. We are everywhere. We don\u0027t look different, but we are.\u0022 She inhales. She\u0027s one of those smokers who hold your eyes when they\u0027re smoking. Cigarettes disappear into her lungs. She says, in English: \u0022It\u0027s our turn. Just our turn.\u0022 She exhales. She has a pleasant smile.\u000A\u000AShe met her girlfriend four and a half years ago, at a lesbian movie night in a club. The movie was Lost and Delirious, translated into Russian as They\u0027re Not Gonna Get You. Mischa Barton, prep-school lesbians. They both thought it was a little childish. Elena liked Anya\u0027s seriousness and her broad grin; she liked her earnestness and her calm. Their love was quick and deep and strong. Soon Elena was thinking about a home together. \u0022Then I was thinking, &amp;#x2018;I have health issues. I\u0027m hospitalized once in a while. I can be unconscious—who will come and make medical decisions for me?\u0027 Then, at one moment, I realize Anya is the one I want to have my children with.\u0022 That\u0027s when she got scared. \u0022Before that, I didn\u0027t feel like I was discriminated against. Then Anya appeared.\u0022\u000A\u000AShe\u0027d reported on pride events in 2009. She found it pitiful: a handful of queers. \u0022Why does nobody want to defend my rights?\u0022 she\u0027d ask. \u0022Why does nobody want to fight for my happy future?\u0022\u000A\u000AThe morning of the pride demonstrations in 2011, Elena wrote a post on her blog that would, in the days that followed, go viral. It was very simple: \u0022Why I Am Going to Gay Pride.\u0022 She was going for Anya. They would wear silly T-shirts—i love her, with arrows. Elena made a sign that said hate is boring.She put on a black raincoat, Anya an olive green one, to hide their shirts until they got there. \u0022I was scared that at the moment I wouldn\u0027t be able to unzip my raincoat, that people would somehow feel we were lesbians, that we would be beaten before raising the flag.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere is video of the man attacking Elena. His name is Roman Lisunov. Not an activist—a family man. \u0022Just a simple Russian guy,\u0022 as homophobes here like to say. Elena\u0027s flag flickers, and then hurtling from behind comes Lisunov\u0027s fist, taking Elena\u0027s skull flat across his knuckles, just above her left ear. In his defense, he will tell the police that he is baptized. That\u0027s it. Good enough! The detective assigned to the case will ask her lawyer, \u0022Why would she go to the street? What protection does she want now?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThey caught Anya on the metro. \u0022They know our faces really well,\u0022 says Elena. They know all the activists. \u0022They know Anya is my girlfriend.\u0022 Three surrounded her on the escalator going down. One put Anya in a headlock to hold her still, then smashed his fist up into her face once, twice, three times, four, five. Anya counted.\u000A\u000AThis was after a kiss-in protest at the Duma last winter. It wasn\u0027t like they hadn\u0027t been warned. Some neo-Nazis had posted instructions online: \u0022The guys, we beat them until they can\u0027t stand up anymore. The women, we break their faces.\u0022 But the men in the metro weren\u0027t Nazis. Their leader seemed to be a man named Dmitry Enteo, a one-man would-be Pussy Riot of the right who leads an \u0022action art\u0022 group called God\u0027s Will, linked to the Russian Orthodox Church. Like performance art, Enteo will tell me later, only, you know, more real. He\u0027s kind of a hipster.\u000A\u000AThe kiss-ins were Elena\u0027s idea. She\u0027d been complaining to a friend. \u0022I am tired of standing there with a poster,\u0022 she said. Well, said her friend, what would you rather be doing? Easy question! \u0022Kissing Anya.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnnouncing the event on her blog, she wrote: \u0022A kiss only concerns two people.... It does not need permission from deputies of the Duma.\u0022 And: \u0022How long should you kiss? However long you like.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnyone was invited to join them. \u0022I don\u0027t like being an activist,\u0022 she says. But what choice does she have? \u0022It\u0027s a long time until there will be some kind of magical Russian Harvey Milk who will defend my rights. I have been waiting, but he is not coming.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe LGBT movement splits along two philosophical lines, she says. \u0022One of them says we need to work through education and enlightenment. The other says we should stop trying to get everyone to like us. I respect the educational approach. It takes a lot of time. I don\u0027t have so much time. We want to have children. I need my rights now.\u0022 Her demands are modest: marriage, kids, a mortgage. Also, if possible, she would like not to be murdered. She doesn\u0027t want to be Harvey Milk: \u0022Harvey Milk was killed!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Take a plane,\u0022 her mother begs her. Emigrate. \u0022Two hours, you will be in another world, where you will be loved and needed.\u0022 But Elena can\u0027t leave. So now her mother calls her after every action. \u0022Are you in a police van?\u0022 she asks. \u0022If I say yes, she says, &amp;#x2018;Thank God.\u0027 \u0022 Better a jailed daughter than a dead one.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe day of the fourth and last kiss-in, the day the law passed, June 2013, the haters tried a new weapon. It gives even Elena pause. She stubs out a cigarette, starts a fresh one, and begins to speak. Zhenya listens. \u0022The homophobes...,\u0022 he says, starting his translation. Then he stops. \u0022Zhenya?\u0022 I ask. Elena continues. Zhenya is nodding, but he says nothing. His face is flushing.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s 26, grew up in Vladivostok, was beaten, saw his straight friends beaten for trying to protect him. He became an exile at the first chance, living abroad for five years. He worked for a human-rights organization, writing reports on the escalating violence in Russia. It wasn\u0027t enough. After the law passed, he came home. \u0022To fight,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A\u0022Zhenya?\u0022 I say again. He\u0027s staring at the wall. Elena says, \u0022He is crying.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe composes himself and continues the translation of the story that overwhelmed him. On the day of the last kiss-in, the mob tried something new. They brought their children. Action art. A mockery. A lesson. Not rocks; the children were their weapon. Who would hit a child? Adolescent boys, 12, 13, moved in packs from activist to activist, one by one, throwing fists, kicking. It was a day of beatings.\u000A\u000AIt takes me a moment. \u0022Their kids?\u0022\u000A\u000AElena smiles. \u0022Yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022We couldn\u0027t fight them,\u0022 says Zhenya, finishing his translation. He moans and starts to shake. And that\u0027s it; now he\u0027s broken. Because everybody knows 12-year-old boys can be real shits, these are the same fights they have with one another in the schoolyard, but the hope is that they\u0027ll grow up, that their parents will teach them. The hope is always that it will get better.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAt a club called Ice, I befriend a long-necked hustler with bright green eyes, wearing a white NYPD cap. His name is Nikolai. He says he kissed his first boy at 14 but that it took him until he was 17 to realize he was gay. He was small in school and he fought often, but he was perhaps a little slow to grasp his social condition; he didn\u0027t understand why other boys beat him. By the time he got it, he\u0027d learned how to beat them. Such was his coming-out story.\u000A\u000AHe was happy being gay, though. He liked knowing what he wanted. The problem was his mother. Gay she could handle, but she wanted grandkids. She made him a deal: an apartment in exchange for grandchildren. Plural. Minimum two.\u000A\u000ASo Nikolai did what he had to do: \u0022I married a woman. I am a father!\u0022 He beams. He has delivered the goods: a girl, 1&amp;#xBD; years old; a boy, 4 months. His mother rewarded him with the apartment, and he came out to his wife. \u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t think there is homophobia in Russia,\u0022 he says, \u0022because I always carry a gun.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe logic takes me a moment. He means they can\u0027t hurt him, because he will hurt them first. His father, a \u0022criminal,\u0022 he says, found Nikolai on a Grindr-like app once. He said he was coming to kill Nikolai. Nikolai wrote back: \u0022I\u0027m waiting for you.\u0022 His father never came. Nikolai is waiting. He taps one side of his head and then the other, to show the path of the bullet he\u0027ll put through his father\u0027s skull.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022Violence Is Acceptable\u0022\u000A\u000AThere are three faces of homophobia in Russia: that of the state, that of the Orthodox Church, that of the fringe. And yet they\u0027re one—a kind of Trinity. The state passes laws; the church blesses them; the fringe puts them into action. The state is the mind of hate, the church, now, its heart; the fringe is made up of its many hands. Some use the courts; some use fists. There are street fighters, and there are polished men and women who attend international conferences on \u0022family values.\u0022\u000A\u000ATimur Isaev uses cameras. He likes to watch.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s how his activism began, he tells me one night in St. Petersburg. As young men, he and his friends liked to hunt and beat gays. \u0022For fun,\u0022 he says. But then he became a father. Like many parents, he worried about the Internet. Late at night, he studied it. He watched YouTube. \u0022Girls,\u0022 he says, \u0022young girls, undressing themselves.\u0022 Using a special \u0022tool for developers,\u0022 he says, he was able to discern that the other people watching these videos at 2 a.m. were homosexual men. \u0022The analysis of their accounts,\u0022 he says, \u0022showed that they also watched young boys.\u0022 That\u0027s when Timur realized he must become an activist. For the children.\u000A\u000ATimur bought a video camera, a very good one. He began documenting LGBT life. At first, demonstrations; then he began idling outside activists\u0027 offices, filming and photographing people coming and going. He showed me one of his galleries: dozens, maybe hundreds of faces. Some he has photographed himself, others he finds online. He is a great policeman of VK, Russia\u0027s version of Facebook. These days he stays up late at night searching for homosexual teachers. It\u0027s kind of his specialty.\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve sought Timur out to confirm a story I\u0027d been told the night before at LaSky, from a former schoolteacher named Olga Bakhaeva. She said she\u0027d lost her job because Timur, posing as a concerned mother, had outed her.\u000A\u000A\u0022Is Olga\u0027s story true?\u0022 I ask Timur.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yes!\u0022 he says, flattered. In fact, he is working on another teacher now. She\u0027s going to be fired next week, he hopes. \u0022We usually fire good shots—good informational shots,\u0022 he says. Olga was his sixth. He takes out his tablet to shows me the others. He loves social media. He poses for a picture, holding up a photograph of Olga he found online. It\u0027s a trophy.\u000A\u000AHow does he do it? He has connections. In my notebook he scribbles a list of names and numbers, a Who\u0027s Who of right-wing St. Petersburg, including Vitaly Milonov, the author of the city\u0027s anti-gay legislation. Timur makes calls when he senses something suspicious. Just last night he had another success. There was a support group for LGBT families. He\u0027d been stalking it online. He had information that there would be a minor there. He\u0027d arranged a raid.\u000A\u000AIt was true. As it happens, I had been at that meeting. The police had been right outside the door, held at bay because they didn\u0027t have the right warrant. Inside, there was a 17-year-old boy talking about coming out to his mother. For this, we all could have gone to prison.\u000A\u000AIn America, I\u0027d dismiss Timur as a crank. In Russia, he seems everywhere to be at the center of events. He scrolls through his photos to show me something special—LaSky, the site of Dmitry Chizhevsky\u0027s shooting, with multiple views of the area outside. Timur says the gays did it to themselves. To make Russia look bad. See, he says, \u0022thirteen surveillance cameras.\u0022 He has documented them. \u0022Here,\u0022 he says, pointing to a picture, \u0022there is a very good camera. You couldn\u0027t have gone unnoticed.\u0022 He points to another. \u0022Can\u0027t get past this camera....\u0022 It is impossible, he says. \u0022No sane person would go there with a gun. You would have to go there without a mask and put it on there.\u0022 Which is what happened. He knows how it could have been done: \u0022I have blueprints of the building.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe moves on, showing more pictures. He slides the tablet across to me, reaching over and flicking through the images, talking about men \u0022who are not worthy of the nationalist name. People like this...\u0022 He looks down at the tablet. It is not a picture of a person; it is a picture of an air gun, a pistol, still in the box, on top of it a jar of little metal balls. \u0022Ah,\u0022 he says. He didn\u0027t mean to show that one. I\u0027m just as stunned. \u0022A gift for my son,\u0022 he says quickly, searching for photographs of the boy. He wants to prove the innocence of the gun.\u000A\u000ATimur knows what I\u0027m thinking. He says, \u0022If I wanted to shoot someone, I would think of my safety first.\u0022 Proof, he claims, that he is not the man who shot Dmitry Chizhevsky in the eye. Too risky.\u000A\u000ABesides, says Timur, he is a peaceful man now. He giggles.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAt St. Petersburg\u0027s __biggest gay club, I meet a bartender in tight jean shorts and a skimpy turquoise tank top who whispers to me, \u0022I\u0027m not gay.\u0022 He pretends, for the job. In fact, he says, \u0022I\u0027m a homophobe.\u0022 He struggles not to hit his customers. But he wishes he could change. \u0022I don\u0027t want to hate anymore,\u0022 he says. He glances at a man who\u0027s been giving him the eye. He shudders. \u0022It\u0027s not working.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWe are walking down a long dark street on the outskirts of St. Petersburg on our way to a meeting Timur has arranged with Anatoly Artyukh—pronounced \u0022R-2.\u0022 Artyukh is the big man in Timur\u0027s circles, the founder of the St. Petersburg branch of Narodny Sobor—\u0022People\u0027s Council\u0022—a national umbrella group for hundreds of organizations dedicated to preserving Russia\u0027s \u0022traditional values.\u0022 It accepts all kinds: skinheads, Cossacks, veterans, Orthodox crusaders, scary squadrons of angry mothers, and more than a few politicians—Artyukh himself is an \u0022aide\u0022 to Vitaly Milonov.\u000A\u000AWhen we get to the backdoor apartment-block address we\u0027ve been given, we\u0027re taken into the basement, a rec room that is filling up for a meeting. On the agenda: developing \u0022new tools\u0022 to defeat the homosexualists. A lot of old guys, sour with broad pickled faces. Some young guys in track pants; a couple of babushkas in leather. There\u0027s a man dressed like a Cossack, like an extra from the big pogrom number in Fiddler on the Roof. One of the last to arrive is Artyukh, a gray-black widow\u0027s-peaked buzz cut squaring off a face like Sean Connery plus fifty pounds. Leather jacket, shoulders padded, black suit beneath, black shirt unbuttoned to air out a few iron curls. He says this is a private club but he\u0027ll receive us upstairs.\u000A\u000ATwo floors up, Artyukh settles behind a giant desk. One of Artyukh\u0027s lieutenants, exceedingly friendly despite the boss\u0027s open hostility, directs us to our seats.\u000A\u000AArtyukh leans back, fat fingers knitted across his stomach. Over his right shoulder there\u0027s the double-headed-eagle flag of czarist Russia; on his desk there\u0027s a bouquet of four flags from the old Confederacy. \u0022Gift from American friends,\u0022 he says. \u0022We consider them brothers.\u0022 In fact, many of the People\u0027s Council\u0027s initiatives—including the \u0022research\u0022 in which the anti-propaganda law is rooted—are taken from the curdled theories of the American right. \u0022When people read it, they are shocked! They understand the gays are not some harmless people.\u0022\u000A\u000AArtyukh says he is afraid blood will be shed. That\u0027s why he\u0027s for the full criminalization of homosexuality: \u0022to protect the people from being hurt. The homosexual people.\u0022 They have a choice: let the law walk them back into the closet, or war. He will accept either. \u0022When there is war, you can see the enemy.\u0022\u000A\u000AViolence is justified?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yes, of course violence is acceptable.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022What about actions like Timur\u0027s?\u0022 I mention the incident at LaSky. \u0022You know about this?\u0022\u000A\u000AHe does a perfect Tony Soprano, that little pressed-lip half smile with a head nod. \u0022Yes,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A\u0022Was it the right way to fight?\u0022\u000A\u000AArtyukh glances at his lieutenant and arches an eyebrow. \u0022Timur is Muslim,\u0022 he says. \u0022Muslim people are heated guys.\u0022 He thumps his chest. \u0022Fire in their hearts. Cruel men.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe nods. He feels he has said it well. \u0022I only pray for him not to cross the line of the law. I would not want to have to get him out of jail. But we support his activities.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022This confrontation,\u0022 I say, referring to the shooting, \u0022is that crossing the line?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022It is,\u0022 says Artyukh. But only slightly. \u0022If the government doesn\u0027t act, other methods will be used. There are going to be fists, and then there are going to be shots.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe last man we talk to that night is the Cossack. Or rather, we listen. Artyukh\u0027s lieutenant fetches him for us. He\u0027s a big man with sallow eyes and a mighty mustache, his head shaved on the sides and a sweep of black hair falling over his shoulders in a style traditional to Cossacks for hundreds of years before Canadians invented the mullet. His uniform is black with red piping, cinched at the cuffs and above his big black boots.\u000A\u000A\u0022Homosexualism is a war against Cossacks,\u0022 he tells us. So by rights homosexuals should be slaughtered. He recounts some of the ways Cossacks murder homosexuals. Historically speaking. \u0022Of course, I cannot say this officially.\u0022 He cracks his first smile. \u0022Cossacks,\u0022 he says, \u0022are known for their humor.\u0022 For instance, gay men \u0022like to put their cocks in the ass, so we put the shit on their cocks for them.\u0022 In fact, he says, sometimes they hold a man down and smear shit over his whole body. He chortles, waits for me to laugh. Do I not think this is funny?\u000A\u000A\u0022Tell me about your outfit,\u0022 I say brightly. He shows me his whip, weighted with a sharp lead block. He puts its thick wooden grip in my hand. \u0022Feel,\u0022 he says. He unsheathes a wide black blade as long as my forearm. He says nothing about the handgun at his side.\u000A\u000A\u0022What kind of gun is that?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A\u0022A good one,\u0022 he says. He releases the clip to show me it\u0027s loaded. He pushes the clip back in. He points the gun at me. Very casual. Just in my direction. Cossack humor. Do I not think this is funny? I lift my notebook off the table. It\u0027s time to go. He reaches across and thumps it down. \u0022Pishi,\u0022 he says. \u0022Write.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Future, Vandalized\u000A\u000AIn Russia, things are not falling apart, they\u0027re coming together, isolated attacks developing into a pattern, the id of the street ever more in line with the Kremlin\u0027s growing ego. My last day in Russia began with the news that Cossacks had vandalized two theaters in the night, neither of them gay but guilty of showing plays with homosexual characters. One got graffiti; the other got a bloody pig\u0027s head at its door. Humor. Russia\u0027s first queer film festival was to open that night—Gus Van Sant was coming to show Milk—but it was shut down by a bomb threat. In the afternoon, Artyukh just happened to be having a coffee at a café next to the theater. He got into an argument with a gay activist. Artyukh ripped out the man\u0027s earring.\u000A\u000ABy then I was with Timur again, pressing him about the picture of the gun and about Artyukh\u0027s words. Were they true? Was he a \u0022heated man\u0022? Timur was furious. He called Artyukh and put him on speaker phone. Artyukh declared Timur innocent. He declared me a liar. He said he had never heard of the attack at LaSky. Timur grew angrier. What right did I have to dispute him? \u0022Whoever did this\u0022—shooting Dmitry—\u0022it\u0027s not your place to judge!\u0022 He said I was a guest in his country; he said I have no rights. A warning. My flight was midmorning, but I left and went back to my hotel and packed and went to the airport. It was 4 a.m.\u000A\u000AI tried not to think about Timur. Instead, I thought about a boy I\u0027ll call Peter. He\u0027s 8 years old, the son of a lesbian activist, Sasha, and her partner, Ksenia. I\u0027d met Sasha at the LGBT organization where she worked. Peter was watching a cartoon, waiting for his mother. He invited me home with them. Peter\u0027s skinny and pale, with rosy lips and big bright eyes, and he does not like to stop moving. As we walked, he bounced back and forth between us, a game he called \u0022white blood cell.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe was born HIV-positive. He\u0027s healthy, but when Sasha met him, volunteering at an orphanage, he weighed half as much as a 3&amp;#xBD; year-old boy should, and his hair was falling out. The only word he knew was Russian for \u0022Don\u0027t do that.\u0022 The nurses told Sasha not to touch him. Not because of the HIV. It was love they were concerned with. If he received any, he\u0027d want more, and none would be forthcoming. He was aging out of the ward, and now they were going to send him to another one, more hopeless still, where he would be thrown in with lost causes of all ages. And there he would remain, as long as he remained.\u000A\u000ASo Sasha took him. She lied to the orphanage, claimed she was single, and took him home to Ksenia, and they hugged him and told him they would love him, even though they didn\u0027t know him. Six months later, he said the second word of his life: his name. He has a name. It breaks my heart that I can\u0027t tell it to you.\u000A\u000AMy last day, in between the pig\u0027s head and the bomb threat, I met Sasha and Peter at the park, where Sasha told me about growing up in a city without a name, one of the Soviet Union\u0027s secret closed military cities, left off the map and known only by a number. Sasha is built like an elf, with freckles and red hair pulled back in a ponytail. She was a shy and dutiful girl until she saw Ksenia on the day of her college exams. They marveled over each other. Neither of them knew what to call this feeling. They had never heard of lesbians. Literally—they did not know the word. When they kissed, Sasha wondered if they were inventing something new and wonderful. They knew they could tell no one.\u000A\u000ABut Sasha\u0027s mother confronted her one night. \u0022What do you have with this girl?\u0022 Sasha, who had never defied her parents, who had never defied anyone, was speechless for a moment. She had no words. Then she found one. \u0022Everything.\u0022\u000A\u000APeter knows his mothers are lesbians. What he does not know is that people hate them. Soon, says Sasha, they will have to tell him. Maybe sooner than they had planned. One law has passed; another is coming. They are thinking about Finland, so they can stay close to Russia. They are thinking about Russia, and about how they don\u0027t want to leave.\u000A\u000APeter is thinking about faraway places. Over dinner, he asks me if I\u0027ll send him a card from America. I can do better than that—how about a present? \u0022Yes!\u0022 he says. He knows what he wants. He asks if he can borrow my notebook. He\u0027ll draw it for me.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s an airplane. A big one, so there\u0027s room for his whole family. Everyone who loves him, he says happily, drawing the wings.\u000A\u000A  1. The names in this section have been changed.\u000A\u000AJeff Sharlet (@JeffSharlet), a fellow with the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute, is the author most recently of Sweet Heaven When I Die.",

If you&#x2019;re young and queer and hopeful, it&#x2019;s the happiest way to end a weekend. An actual tea party. There are also cookies and&#x2014;at LaSky, the HIV-awareness center that often hosts the event&#x2014;more brightly colored giant beanbags than chairs, plus a lot of posters of hunky bare-chested men with floppy hair. There are many, many rainbows, on stickers and pins and brochures, and a rainbow curtain covering a strange little door in the corner.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3"> The door leads to a club called Bunker, which is really a maze, twisting through the rest of the building&#x2019;s vast basement. It&#x2019;s dark; you have to feel your way through. The men who go to Bunker&#x2014;many or maybe most of them &quot;straight&quot; men, married men, says the bartender&#x2014;are looking for bodies, not faces. They don&#x2019;t want to see or be seen, only to touch and to be touched in a place where nobody knows them.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.5">Those are the choices: light or dark, tea or poppers, a well-lit game of charades or a grope in the dungeon. Sweet or sordid, it doesn&#x2019;t matter: In Russia now&#x2014;in the throes of a fever stoked by the Kremlin&#x2014;both must be hidden. They are not hidden well enough.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.6">One evening in November&#x2014;the city center like a bowl of pastel candies, Orthodox onion-domes rising above it like spun sugar&#x2014;two strangers found their way to LaSky. They walked down a long street between a busy road and a canal until they came to an arch in a building. They went through the arch and down a dark alley before they arrived at an unlit empty parking lot, blacktop crumbling. Here they may have stopped to put on their masks. They crossed the lot toward a stand of scrub trees and weeds and took a left down a narrow path, then down an even darker set of uneven stairs to an unmarked steel door. The strangers stood at the threshold.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.7">It was Rainbow Tea Party night. A woman named Anna asked who was there. &quot;We&#x2019;re looking for our friend!&quot; replied one of the strangers. They shoved past her. In the hall, a man named Dmitry Chizhevsky was looking for his jacket. Behind him was a girl I&#x2019;ll call Rose, a few weeks shy of her eighteenth birthday. Rose glanced toward the door: two men wearing ski masks. &quot;Then,&quot; she says, &quot;they started shooting.&quot; Chizhevsky: &quot;The first bullet came into my eye. The first, the very first.&quot; Rose: &quot;I had a thought in my head&#x2014;maybe I should do something, maybe I should scream.&quot; Chizhevsky: &quot;I can remember more closely what was audio.&quot; <em>Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, </em>he recalls hearing. Five, he thinks. He says he remembers the sound of the bullet hitting his eye.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.8">Dmitry went down, and Rose ran, and Dmitry crawled. The men followed, kicking. One of them had a bat, &quot;a baseball bat, yes,&quot; says Dmitry. They were screaming. &quot;Faggot, faggot, faggot.&quot; The bat came down. And then the faggots in the other room charged the men with the gun and the bat and the masks, and the men ran away. Dmitry and Anna, who&#x2019;d been shot in the back, inspected their wounds.

Books are being banned&#x2014;Burroughs and Baudelaire and Huxley&#x2019;s <em>Brave New World</em>&#x2014;immigrants hunted, journalists killed, a riot-grrrl band, Pussy Riot, imprisoned for almost two years for playing a &quot;Punk Prayer&quot; in a Moscow cathedral; blasphemy is now illegal. Civil society isn&#x2019;t just coming undone; it&#x2019;s imploding. I wanted to visit the bottom of the heap. The <em>golubye. </em>The blues, which in Russia is another word for queer&#x2014;any way of being other than &quot;Russian,&quot; which, under President Vladimir Putin, has become a kind of sexual orientation. I wanted to see what ordinary LGBT life was like in a nation whose leaders have decided that &quot;homosexualism&quot; is a threat to its &quot;sexual sovereignty,&quot; that &quot;genderless tolerance,&quot; in Putin&#x2019;s words, is a disease of the West that Russia will cure. The medicine is that of &quot;traditional values,&quot; a phrase, ironically, imported from the West, grafted onto a deeply conformist strain of nationalism. In Russia, that means silence and violence, censorship, and in its shadow, much worse.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.h">One of the first men I met was Alex, a gay police officer who&#x2019;d recently quit his job rather than enforce Russia&#x2019;s new anti-gay law. He wasn&#x2019;t always so principled: One of Alex&#x2019;s early assignments on the force was snooping through a fellow officer&#x2019;s computer for evidence of homosexuality. &quot;I was just lucky it wasn&#x2019;t <em>my </em>computer,&quot; Alex said one night at a caf&#xE9; on Arbat Street, Moscow&#x2019;s main thoroughfare of consumer hipsterism.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.i">His boyfriend wasn&#x2019;t as glib: &quot;It&#x2019;s Germany in the &#x2019;30s,&quot; he declared. &quot;Hush, hush,&quot; Alex said. &quot;Not so loud.&quot; It&#x2019;s not Germany in the &#x2019;30s, he said; it&#x2019;s Russia now. And that&#x2019;s a subtler problem.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.j">Yes, there are killings. In May, a 23-year-old man in Volgograd allegedly came out to a group of friends, who raped him with beer bottles and smashed his skull in with a stone; and in June a group of friends in Kamchatka kicked and stabbed to death a 39-year-old gay man, then burned the body. There&#x2019;s a national network called Occupy Pedophilia, whose members torture gay men and post hugely popular videos of their &quot;interrogations&quot; online. There are countless smaller, bristling movements, with names presumptuous (God&#x2019;s Will) or absurd (Homophobic Wolf). There are babushkas who throw stones, and priests who bless the stones, and police who arrest their victims.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.k">But such people exist everywhere, said Alex. The difference in Russia now is who&#x2019;s standing behind them.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.l">The Russian closet has always been deep, but since last June, when the Duma began passing laws designed to shove Russia&#x2019;s tiny out population back into it, the closet has been getting darker. The first law banned gay &quot;propaganda,&quot; but it was written so as to leave the definition vague. It&#x2019;s a mechanism of thought control, its target not so much gays as anybody the state declares gay; a virtual resurrection of Article 70 from the old Soviet system, forbidding &quot;anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda.&quot; Then, as now, nobody knew exactly what &quot;propaganda&quot; was. The new law explicitly forbids any suggestion that queer love is equal to that of heterosexuals, but what constitutes such a suggestion? One man was charged for holding up a sign that said being gay is ok. Pride parades are out of the question, a pink triangle enough to get you arrested, if not beaten. A couple holding hands could be accused of propaganda if they do so where a minor might see them; the law, as framed, is all about protecting the children. Yelena Mizulina, chair of the Duma Committee on Family, Women, and Children&#x2019;s Affairs and the author of the bill, says that it&#x2019;s too late to save adult &quot;homosexualists,&quot; as they&#x2019;re called, but Russia still has a chance to raise a pure generation.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.m">Mizulina&#x2019;s dream isn&#x2019;t old-fashioned; it is, as one fascist supporter told me, &quot;utopian.&quot; He meant that as praise. And the Russian dream is not alone. Liberal Americans imagine LGBT rights as slowly but surely marching forward. But queer rights don&#x2019;t advance along a straight line. In Russia and throughout Eastern Europe&#x2014;and in India and in Australia, in a belt across Central Africa&#x2014;anti-gay crusaders are developing new laws and sharpening old ones. The ideas, meanwhile, are American: the rhetoric of &quot;family values&quot; churned out by right-wing American think tanks, bizarre statistics to prove that evil is a fact, its face a gay one. This hatred is old venom, but its weaponization by nations as a means with which to fight &quot;globalization&quot;&#x2014;not the economic kind, the human-rights kind&#x2014;is a new terror.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.n"> In Russia, the process is accelerating. In 2006, a bill similar to the law was laughed out of the Duma, dismissed by the then deputy prime minister as &quot;a row of mistakes.&quot; In June it passed, 436-0. Alex the cop says 2010 was the best year, a new club or caf&#xE9; opening every other weekend. New LGBT groups were forming all over. &quot;It was like a party,&quot; one activist told me. What happened between then and now has as much to do with the unstable price of oil and Putin&#x2019;s eroding popular support as it does with actual queer people. The less prosperity Putin can deliver, the more he speaks of holy Russian empire, language to which the Russian Orthodox Church thrills. Putin, says Patriarch Kirill, the church&#x2019;s leader, is a living &quot;act of God.&quot; Forget about the price of bread and what you can&#x2019;t afford. Putin has come to save the Russian soul.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.o">Article 6.21, the law&#x2019;s official designation, has proven to be the Duma&#x2019;s most popular social initiative of the year; according to one poll, only 7 percent of Russians firmly oppose it. Another new law requiring nonprofits that receive support outside Russia to register as foreign agents has been used to justify police raids on the country&#x2019;s leading LGBT organizations. In July, Putin signed a law banning the adoption of Russian children by gay parents abroad.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.p">And in October, the Duma started to take up a law to remove children from LGBT parents in Russia. It&#x2019;s been put on hold, but it&#x2019;s expected to return once the Olympics and international scrutiny have passed.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.q">&quot;The problem is bigger than laws,&quot; a gay activist named Igor Iasine told me, tracing a line through his beard where neo-Nazis had broken his jaw. &quot;The law is icing on the cake.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.r">For Dmitry Kiselyov, the director of Russia&#x2019;s massive new state media corporation&#x2014;created in December to swallow up state media entities that show any hint of autonomy&#x2014;laws are not enough. He&#x2019;s concerned about organ donors, the possibility of a queer heart beating in a straight body.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.s">When homosexuals die, he says, &quot;their hearts should be burned.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.t"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.u"><em>&quot;I haven&#x2019;t heard__ of these laws, but I think it&#x2019;s fine,&quot; a kid named Kirill tells me at a hidden gay club called Secrets. &quot;We don&#x2019;t need gay pride here.

Two families, two daughters. They leave the doors open to allow easy access from one to the other.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.y">Pavel<strong> <a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/big-issues/201402/being-gay-in-russia?currentPage=6#1">1</a> </strong> met Irina not long after he moved to Moscow twelve years ago, and almost immediately he knew that someday he&#x2019;d start a family with her. Irina felt it, too. They agreed on it one night over vodka, after a night of clubbing. The party had moved back to an apartment, where they kept drinking, Irina teasing Pavel, Pavel marveling at Irina&#x2019;s bold friends. She was a Muscovite; Pavel had come from one of those distant eastern cities, 4,000 miles from Moscow. Irina was six years younger, but she was his teacher, teaching him how to be silly and modern and free. They drank and danced, Pavel discovering his hips, until they both collapsed around a kitchen table and, over more vodka, Pavel tried to be funny and Irina thought he was, so she said, &quot;Someday I would like to have a child with you.&quot; Pavel said, &quot;I feel the same.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.z">Suddenly they were sober, giddy but clear: They knew it was true. But they had to wait. <em>To have children is a great responsibility, </em>Pavel thought. <em>You have to have a place to live. You have to earn. You have to have a partner you can rely on.</em> In 2010, they were ready. Their best friends, Nik and Zoya, were having a baby, too, and they lived right next door. Their children would grow up together. Two little girls: Nik and Zoya&#x2019;s Kristina, and then Pavel and Irina&#x2019;s Emma.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.10">Now they are one big happy family, inseparable. Pavel has always been great with kids. He likes to read the girls Russian fairy tales, and he buys DVDs of old Russian cartoons, the ones he was raised on. They watch them together. The girls toddle between the apartments through the open doors. Pavel thinks little blonde Kristina looks like an angel. Emma&#x2019;s darker, serious like her father. Both girls call him Papa<em>. </em>The children share a nanny, too, who helps the parents with light cleaning, dishes, and dusting, making sure all the family pictures are in place.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.11">&quot;Nobody would suspect us,&quot; Pavel says. Not even the nanny.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.12">Pavel&#x2019;s secret isn&#x2019;t that he&#x2019;s gay. It&#x2019;s that they all are, the adults: Pavel and Nik and Irina and Zoya. Both girls have two mothers, two fathers; they have beds in both apartments. Their life together was, until recently, the fulfillment of all that Pavel had wanted, an ambition that had come to him at almost the same moment he&#x2019;d realized he was gay: to be &quot;normal.&quot; If he were normal, he thought, then he could be a father. &quot;That,&quot; he tells me, &quot;has been my precious dream.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.13"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fbba3655c24c6c954c17/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2014-02-inside-the-iron-closet-iron-closet-gq-magazine-february-2014-russia-06.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2014-02-inside-the-iron-closet-iron-closet-gq-magazine-february-2014-russia-06.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbeing-gay-in-russia&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-02-inside-the-iron-closet-iron-closet-gq-magazine-february-2014-russia-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbeing-gay-in-russia&amp;t=news-and-politics-2014-02-inside-the-iron-closet-iron-closet-gq-magazine-february-2014-russia-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbeing-gay-in-russia&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbba3655c24c6c954c17%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-02-inside-the-iron-closet-iron-closet-gq-magazine-february-2014-russia-06.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-02-inside-the-iron-closet-iron-closet-gq-magazine-february-2014-russia-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbeing-gay-in-russia&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbba3655c24c6c954c17%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2014-02-inside-the-iron-closet-iron-closet-gq-magazine-february-2014-russia-06.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2014-02-inside-the-iron-closet-iron-closet-gq-magazine-february-2014-russia-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.14"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.15">Pavel agrees to talk to me because soon, he fears, the laws that have passed and the laws to come may make it impossible to hide. I&#x2019;m told to meet him at a metro station. When I arrive&#x2014;with my translator, Zhenya, a gay activist&#x2014;no one is there. A phone call from a mutual friend directs us through the empty station, around a corner, and down some stairs to a basement restaurant, Georgian cuisine, a man in a corner with a bottle of white wine. Is this&#x2014;? Yes. He smiles. We sit down.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.16">&quot;Something is coming,&quot; says Pavel. What it will be, he&#x2019;s not sure. He&#x2019;s worried about &quot;special departments&quot; in local police stations, dedicated to removing children from gay homes. He&#x2019;s worried about a co-worker discovering him. He is worried about blackmail. He is worried, and he does not know what else to do. He wishes he could fight, but he doesn&#x2019;t know how. Sign a petition? March in a parade? Pavel would never do that now. &quot;My children,&quot; he murmurs.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.17">&quot;This law,&quot; he says, referring to the ban on &quot;propaganda.&quot; &quot;If something happens, it touches only me. And I can protect myself.&quot; But the next law: &quot;This is about my child. My baby.&quot; If the next law passes, they will leave. The two women are doctors and Nik works in higher education, careers that will require new certification. Which means that only Pavel, a manager for the state oil company, will be able to work right away. They will be poor, but they will leave. They might have to separate, Pavel and Irina and Emma to Israel, where Irina can become a citizen, Nik and Zoya and Kristina to any country that will take them. They might have to become the couples they pretend to be. For now, they are staying. &quot;We&#x2019;re going to teach them,&quot; he says of his two little girls, Emma and Kristina. &quot;How to protect themselves. How to keep silence.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.18">This is how the law really works: It&#x2019;s the little things that break first. Like a child who wants to call her father Papa. &quot;Father can be only one,&quot; Pavel tells Kristina. She can never call him Papa again. If someone overheard her... No, not even at home.

Moscow&#x2019;s mayor forbade it; he called for &quot;concrete measures&quot; to stop it. On May 27, Alekseyev and a few comrades approached Russia&#x2019;s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with flowers. The tomb is a memorial to the millions of Soviet troops killed in what Russians call the &quot;war against fascism.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1c">The little group found the gate closed.

And a crowd, chanting, &quot;Russia without faggots!&quot; One man, in a fit of apparent generosity, screamed, &quot;You have your nightclubs!&quot; Another began shouting about his grandfather, who had fought in the war. Alekseyev shouted back that his own grandfather died fighting.

Her voice is droll, her manner deadpan, her presence at first unassuming; I talked to her for a couple of hours before I learned how much violence she&#x2019;s endured since that first pride event in &#x2019;11, and she never did get around to telling me that when she was 9 she was given up for dead, warehoused in a cancer ward for kids her provincial hospital deemed &quot;unlikely&quot; to survive.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1p">She and Zhenya and I meet at a dull little caf&#xE9; near her metro station. Grayish pink walls, two TV screens playing Western pop videos from the &#x2019;80s and &#x2019;90s&#x2014;there&#x2019;s a lot of Wham!&#x2014;and a fluorescent-lit smog of cigarette smoke. Elena&#x2019;s a reporter, hard-nosed. &quot;Prostitutes, addicts, these are my people,&quot; she says. She has fainting spells, but she wills herself to keep standing: &quot;A journalist shouldn&#x2019;t faint.&quot; In the nine years she&#x2019;s been working for her paper, <em>Novaya Gazeta</em>&#x2014;the last major opposition publication&#x2014;three of its reporters have been murdered, including Anna Politkovskaya, shot four times in her apartment elevator in 2006, the killer still unknown. &quot;I&#x2019;m lucky,&quot; Elena says. She means alive.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1q">She knows some English, but she speaks mostly in Russian. Explaining her view of Russia&#x2019;s rising homophobia, she dictates to Zhenya: &quot;Putin needs external enemies and internal enemies. The external enemies are the U.S. and Europe. Internal enemies, they had to think about. The ethnic topic is dangerous. Two wars in the Caucasus, a third one, nobody knows how it would end. Jews? After Hitler, it&#x2019;s not kosher. We&#x2014;&quot; she waves a hand at herself and Zhenya&#x2014;&quot;are the ideal. We are everywhere. We don&#x2019;t look different, but we are.&quot; She inhales. She&#x2019;s one of those smokers who hold your eyes when they&#x2019;re smoking. Cigarettes disappear into her lungs. She says, in English: &quot;It&#x2019;s our turn. Just our turn.&quot; She exhales. She has a pleasant smile.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1r">She met her girlfriend four and a half years ago, at a lesbian movie night in a club. The movie was <em>Lost and Delirious,</em> translated into Russian as <em>They&#x2019;re Not Gonna Get You</em>. Mischa Barton, prep-school lesbians. They both thought it was a little childish. Elena liked Anya&#x2019;s seriousness and her broad grin; she liked her earnestness and her calm. Their love was quick and deep and strong. Soon Elena was thinking about a home together. &quot;Then I was thinking, &amp;#x2018;I have health issues. I&#x2019;m hospitalized once in a while. I can be unconscious&#x2014;who will come and make medical decisions for me?&#x2019; Then, at one moment, I realize Anya is the one I want to have my children with.&quot; That&#x2019;s when she got scared. &quot;Before that, I didn&#x2019;t feel like I was discriminated against. Then Anya appeared.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1s">She&#x2019;d reported on pride events in 2009. She found it pitiful: a handful of queers. &quot;Why does nobody want to defend <em>my </em>rights?&quot; she&#x2019;d ask. &quot;Why does nobody want to fight for <em>my</em> happy future?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1t">The morning of the pride demonstrations in 2011, Elena wrote a post on her blog that would, in the days that followed, go viral. It was very simple: &quot;Why I Am Going to Gay Pride.&quot; She was going for Anya. They would wear silly T-shirts&#x2014;i love her, with arrows. Elena made a sign that said hate is boring.She put on a black raincoat, Anya an olive green one, to hide their shirts until they got there. &quot;I was scared that at the moment I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to unzip my raincoat, that people would somehow feel we were lesbians, that we would be beaten before raising the flag.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1u">There is video of the man attacking Elena. His name is Roman Lisunov. Not an activist&#x2014;a family man. &quot;Just a simple Russian guy,&quot; as homophobes here like to say. Elena&#x2019;s flag flickers, and then hurtling from behind comes Lisunov&#x2019;s fist, taking Elena&#x2019;s skull flat across his knuckles, just above her left ear. In his defense, he will tell the police that he is baptized. That&#x2019;s it. Good enough! The detective assigned to the case will ask her lawyer, &quot;Why would she go to the street? What protection does she want now?&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1v"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1w">They caught Anya on the metro. &quot;They know our faces really well,&quot; says Elena. They know all the activists. &quot;They know Anya is my girlfriend.&quot; Three surrounded her on the escalator going down. One put Anya in a headlock to hold her still, then smashed his fist up into her face once, twice, three times, four, five. Anya counted.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1x">This was after a kiss-in protest at the Duma last winter. It wasn&#x2019;t like they hadn&#x2019;t been warned. Some neo-Nazis had posted instructions online: &quot;The guys, we beat them until they can&#x2019;t stand up anymore. The women, we break their faces.&quot; But the men in the metro weren&#x2019;t Nazis. Their leader seemed to be a man named Dmitry Enteo, a one-man would-be Pussy Riot of the right who leads an &quot;action art&quot; group called God&#x2019;s Will, linked to the Russian Orthodox Church. Like performance art, Enteo will tell me later, only, you know, more real. He&#x2019;s kind of a hipster.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1y">The kiss-ins were Elena&#x2019;s idea. She&#x2019;d been complaining to a friend. &quot;I am tired of standing there with a poster,&quot; she said. Well, said her friend, what would you rather be doing? Easy question! &quot;Kissing Anya.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.1z">Announcing the event on her blog, she wrote: &quot;A kiss only concerns two people.... It does not need permission from deputies of the Duma.&quot; And: &quot;How long should you kiss? However long you like.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.20">Anyone was invited to join them. &quot;I don&#x2019;t like being an activist,&quot; she says.

I have been waiting, but he is not coming.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.21">The LGBT movement splits along two philosophical lines, she says. &quot;One of them says we need to work through education and enlightenment. The other says we should stop trying to get everyone to like us. I respect the educational approach. It takes a lot of time. I don&#x2019;t have so much time. We want to have children. I need my rights now.&quot; Her demands are modest: marriage, kids, a mortgage. Also, if possible, she would like not to be murdered. She doesn&#x2019;t want to be Harvey Milk: &quot;Harvey Milk was killed!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.22">&quot;Take a plane,&quot; her mother begs her. Emigrate. &quot;Two hours, you will be in another world, where you will be loved and needed.&quot; But Elena can&#x2019;t leave. So now her mother calls her after every action. &quot;Are you in a police van?&quot; she asks. &quot;If I say yes, she says, &amp;#x2018;Thank God.&#x2019; &quot; Better a jailed daughter than a dead one.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.23"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.24">The day of the fourth and last kiss-in, the day the law passed, June 2013, the haters tried a new weapon. It gives even Elena pause. She stubs out a cigarette, starts a fresh one, and begins to speak. Zhenya listens. &quot;The homophobes...,&quot; he says, starting his translation. Then he stops. &quot;Zhenya?&quot; I ask. Elena continues. Zhenya is nodding, but he says nothing. His face is flushing.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.25">He&#x2019;s 26, grew up in Vladivostok, was beaten, saw his straight friends beaten for trying to protect him. He became an exile at the first chance, living abroad for five years. He worked for a human-rights organization, writing reports on the escalating violence in Russia. It wasn&#x2019;t enough. After the law passed, he came home. &quot;To fight,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.26">&quot;Zhenya?&quot; I say again. He&#x2019;s staring at the wall. Elena says, &quot;He is crying.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.27">He composes himself and continues the translation of the story that overwhelmed him. On the day of the last kiss-in, the mob tried something new. They brought their children. Action art. A mockery. A lesson. Not rocks; the children were their weapon. Who would hit a child? Adolescent boys, 12, 13, moved in packs from activist to activist, one by one, throwing fists, kicking. It was a day of beatings.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.28">It takes me a moment. &quot;Their kids?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.29">Elena smiles. &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2a">&quot;We <em>couldn&#x2019;t</em> fight them,&quot; says Zhenya, finishing his translation.

Because everybody knows 12-year-old boys can be real shits, these are the same fights they have with one another in the schoolyard, but the hope is that they&#x2019;ll grow up, that their parents will teach them.

He was small in school and he fought often, but he was perhaps a little slow to grasp his social condition; he didn&#x2019;t understand why other boys beat him.

And yet they&#x2019;re one&#x2014;a kind of Trinity. The state passes laws; the church blesses them; the fringe puts them into action. The state is the mind of hate, the church, now, its heart; the fringe is made up of its many hands. Some use the courts; some use fists. There are street fighters, and there are polished men and women who attend international conferences on &quot;family values.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2k">Timur Isaev uses cameras. He likes to watch.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2l">That&#x2019;s how his activism began, he tells me one night in St. Petersburg. As young men, he and his friends liked to hunt and beat gays. &quot;For fun,&quot; he says. But then he became a father. Like many parents, he worried about the Internet. Late at night, he studied it. He watched YouTube. &quot;Girls,&quot; he says, &quot;young girls, undressing themselves.&quot; Using a special &quot;tool for developers,&quot; he says, he was able to discern that the other people watching these videos at 2 a.m. were homosexual men. &quot;The analysis of their accounts,&quot; he says, &quot;showed that they also watched young boys.&quot; That&#x2019;s when Timur realized he must become an activist. For the children.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2m">Timur bought a video camera, a very good one. He began documenting LGBT life. At first, demonstrations; then he began idling outside activists&#x2019; offices, filming and photographing people coming and going. He showed me one of his galleries: dozens, maybe hundreds of faces. Some he has photographed himself, others he finds online. He is a great policeman of VK, Russia&#x2019;s version of Facebook. These days he stays up late at night searching for homosexual teachers. It&#x2019;s kind of his specialty.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2n">I&#x2019;ve sought Timur out to confirm a story I&#x2019;d been told the night before at LaSky, from a former schoolteacher named Olga Bakhaeva. She said she&#x2019;d lost her job because Timur, posing as a concerned mother, had outed her.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2o">&quot;Is Olga&#x2019;s story true?&quot; I ask Timur.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2p">&quot;Yes!&quot; he says, flattered. In fact, he is working on another teacher now. She&#x2019;s going to be fired next week, he hopes. &quot;We usually fire good shots&#x2014;good <em>informational</em> shots,&quot; he says. Olga was his sixth. He takes out his tablet to shows me the others. He loves social media. He poses for a picture, holding up a photograph of Olga he found online. It&#x2019;s a trophy.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2q">How does he do it? He has connections. In my notebook he scribbles a list of names and numbers, a Who&#x2019;s Who of right-wing St. Petersburg, including Vitaly Milonov, the author of the city&#x2019;s anti-gay legislation. Timur makes calls when he senses something suspicious. Just last night he had another success. There was a support group for LGBT families. He&#x2019;d been stalking it online. He had information that there would be a minor there. He&#x2019;d arranged a raid.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2r">It was true. As it happens, I had been at that meeting. The police had been right outside the door, held at bay because they didn&#x2019;t have the right warrant. Inside, there was a 17-year-old boy talking about coming out to his mother. For this, we all could have gone to prison.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2s">In America, I&#x2019;d dismiss Timur as a crank. In Russia, he seems everywhere to be at the center of events. He scrolls through his photos to show me something special&#x2014;LaSky, the site of Dmitry Chizhevsky&#x2019;s shooting, with multiple views of the area outside. Timur says the gays did it to themselves. To make Russia look bad. See, he says, &quot;thirteen surveillance cameras.&quot; He has documented them. &quot;Here,&quot; he says, pointing to a picture, &quot;there is a very good camera. You couldn&#x2019;t have gone unnoticed.&quot; He points to another. &quot;Can&#x2019;t get past this camera....&quot; It is impossible, he says. &quot;No sane person would go there with a gun. You would have to go there without a mask and put it on there.&quot; Which is what happened. He knows how it could have been done: &quot;I have blueprints of the building.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2t">He moves on, showing more pictures. He slides the tablet across to me, reaching over and flicking through the images, talking about men &quot;who are not worthy of the nationalist name. People like this...&quot; He looks down at the tablet. It is not a picture of a person; it is a picture of an air gun, a pistol, still in the box, on top of it a jar of little metal balls. &quot;Ah,&quot; he says. He didn&#x2019;t mean to show that one. I&#x2019;m just as stunned. &quot;A gift for my son,&quot; he says quickly, searching for photographs of the boy. He wants to prove the innocence of the gun.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2u">Timur knows what I&#x2019;m thinking. He says, &quot;If I wanted to shoot someone, I would think of <em>my</em> safety first.&quot; Proof, he claims, that he is not the man who shot Dmitry Chizhevsky in the eye. Too risky.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.2v">Besides, says Timur, he is a peaceful man now.

There&#x2019;s a man dressed like a Cossack, like an extra from the big pogrom number in <em>Fiddler on the Roof</em>. One of the last to arrive is Artyukh, a gray-black widow&#x2019;s-peaked buzz cut squaring off a face like Sean Connery plus fifty pounds. Leather jacket, shoulders padded, black suit beneath, black shirt unbuttoned to air out a few iron curls.

He says nothing about the handgun at his side.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3h">&quot;What kind of gun is that?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3i">&quot;A good one,&quot; he says. He releases the clip to show me it&#x2019;s loaded. He pushes the clip back in. He points the gun at me. Very casual. Just in my direction. Cossack humor. Do I not think this is funny? I lift my notebook off the table. It&#x2019;s time to go. He reaches across and thumps it down. <em>&quot;Pishi,&quot;</em> he says. &quot;Write.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3j"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3k"><strong>The Future, Vandalized</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3l">In Russia, things are not falling apart, they&#x2019;re coming together, isolated attacks developing into a pattern, the id of the street ever more in line with the Kremlin&#x2019;s growing ego. My last day in Russia began with the news that Cossacks had vandalized two theaters in the night, neither of them gay but guilty of showing plays with homosexual characters. One got graffiti; the other got a bloody pig&#x2019;s head at its door. Humor. Russia&#x2019;s first queer film festival was to open that night&#x2014;Gus Van Sant was coming to show <em>Milk</em>&#x2014;but it was shut down by a bomb threat. In the afternoon, Artyukh just happened to be having a coffee at a caf&#xE9; next to the theater. He got into an argument with a gay activist. Artyukh ripped out the man&#x2019;s earring.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3m">By then I was with Timur again, pressing him about the picture of the gun and about Artyukh&#x2019;s words. Were they true? Was he a &quot;heated man&quot;? Timur was furious. He called Artyukh and put him on speaker phone. Artyukh declared Timur innocent. He declared me a liar. He said he had never heard of the attack at LaSky. Timur grew angrier. What right did I have to dispute him? &quot;Whoever did this&quot;&#x2014;shooting Dmitry&#x2014;&quot;it&#x2019;s not your place to judge!&quot; He said I was a guest in his country; he said I have no rights. A warning. My flight was midmorning, but I left and went back to my hotel and packed and went to the airport. It was 4 a.m.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3n">I tried not to think about Timur. Instead, I thought about a boy I&#x2019;ll call Peter. He&#x2019;s 8 years old, the son of a lesbian activist, Sasha, and her partner, Ksenia. I&#x2019;d met Sasha at the LGBT organization where she worked. Peter was watching a cartoon, waiting for his mother. He invited me home with them. Peter&#x2019;s skinny and pale, with rosy lips and big bright eyes, and he does not like to stop moving. As we walked, he bounced back and forth between us, a game he called &quot;white blood cell.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3o">He was born HIV-positive. He&#x2019;s healthy, but when Sasha met him, volunteering at an orphanage, he weighed half as much as a 3&amp;#xBD; year-old boy should, and his hair was falling out. The only word he knew was Russian for &quot;Don&#x2019;t do that.&quot; The nurses told Sasha not to touch him. Not because of the HIV. It was love they were concerned with. If he received any, he&#x2019;d want more, and none would be forthcoming. He was aging out of the ward, and now they were going to send him to another one, more hopeless still, where he would be thrown in with lost causes of all ages. And there he would remain, as long as he remained.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3p">So Sasha took him. She lied to the orphanage, claimed she was single, and took him home to Ksenia, and they hugged him and told him they would love him, even though they didn&#x2019;t know him. Six months later, he said the second word of his life: his name. He has a name. It breaks my heart that I can&#x2019;t tell it to you.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3q">My last day, in between the pig&#x2019;s head and the bomb threat, I met Sasha and Peter at the park, where Sasha told me about growing up in a city without a name, one of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s secret closed military cities, left off the map and known only by a number. Sasha is built like an elf, with freckles and red hair pulled back in a ponytail. She was a shy and dutiful girl until she saw Ksenia on the day of her college exams. They marveled over each other. Neither of them knew what to call this feeling. They had never heard of lesbians. Literally&#x2014;they did not know the word. When they kissed, Sasha wondered if they were inventing something new and wonderful. They knew they could tell no one.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3r">But Sasha&#x2019;s mother confronted her one night. &quot;What do you have with this girl?&quot; Sasha, who had never defied her parents, who had never defied anyone, was speechless for a moment. She had no words. Then she found one. &quot;Everything.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3s">Peter knows his mothers are lesbians. What he does not know is that people hate them. Soon, says Sasha, they will have to tell him. Maybe sooner than they had planned. One law has passed; another is coming. They are thinking about Finland, so they can stay close to Russia. They are thinking about Russia, and about how they don&#x2019;t want to leave.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3t">Peter is thinking about faraway places. Over dinner, he asks me if I&#x2019;ll send him a card from America. I can do better than that&#x2014;how about a present? &quot;Yes!&quot; he says. He knows what he wants. He asks if he can borrow my notebook. He&#x2019;ll draw it for me.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3u">It&#x2019;s an airplane. A big one, so there&#x2019;s room for his whole family. Everyone who loves him, he says happily, drawing the wings.</p><p data-reactid=".1xej2cq9ybk.1.1.0.0.4.3v"> <a href="being-gay-in-russia"></a> <strong>1.</strong> <em>The names in this section have
