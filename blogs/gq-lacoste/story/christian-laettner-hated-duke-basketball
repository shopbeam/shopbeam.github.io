  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AIf you\u0027re a basketball fan, and especially if you\u0027re a basketball fan who didn\u0027t go to Duke, chances are you hate Christian Laettner. Maybe it\u0027s because every season he spent there ended with him in the Final Four. Maybe it\u0027s because of The Shot against Kentucky. Or maybe it\u0027s for The Stomp before The Shot. But that\u0027s okay. Laettner didn\u0027t want your love. He wanted to win.\u000A\u000A Just in time for another round of March Madness, ESPN presents their latest in their celebrated 30-for-30 sports documentary series, I Hate Christian Laettner, airing this Sunday, shortly after this year\u0027s brackets are unveiled. After discussing the movie with Laettner, we think you should watch it. Maybe you\u0027ll feel differently about him. Probably not.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A \u000A\u000AGQ: It\u0027s been more than two decades since you graduated from Duke. Why did you decide to make this documentary now? \u000A\u000ALaettner: I didn\u0027t want to do it. ESPN just approached me last summer and said, \u0022We want to make a movie about you.\u0022 So it wasn\u0027t up to me, but of course I said yes. They didn\u0027t tell me the name of the title at that point, but I did all the interviews for it and gave the director, Rory Karpf, names to talk to so he could access my parents, siblings, and some other friends.\u000A\u000AThat all went well. Then Rory called me and said, \u0022We\u0027re gonna name it,\u000A\u000AI Hate Christian Laettner\u000A\u000A\u0022 and I laughed at first, because I understand it. People might have gotten tired of seeing my face and my Duke teams at the Final Four four years in a row. When you achieve that level of success, some people get envious. That\u0027s all fine and dandy if I live in a vacuum. But I don\u0027t. I have children, I have a wife, I have friends who don\u0027t necessarily like the title.\u000A\u000AMy father said, \u0022Why can\u0027t they name it, \u0027One of Duke\u0027s Best\u0027?\u0022 My answer to him was, \u0022It\u0027s not provocative.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat are you hoping this accomplishes? \u000A\u000AI don\u0027t know if there\u0027s anythingâ€”it\u0027s just an honor to have ESPN want to make a movie about you. Part of me would like for not all the Kentucky, Carolina, and Connecticut fans to despise me, but another part of me realizes that\u0027s not important. It\u0027s not good to be a hater. Hopefully that\u0027s what people will take away from it.\u000A\u000ADid you want to be hated? \u000A\u000ANo one wants to be hated. All I wanted to do was win. People have to remember that when I came to Duke, they\u0027d started to get a reputation that they can\u0027t win the big game. We were aware of that and we hated it. Coach K would always talk to us about having to be tougher minded, tougher physically, more intense, more passionate. I maybe took it to another level, where I was really tough on my teammates. But I don\u0027t know why people were acting like they were so shocked.\u000A\u000ABut you liked wearing the black hat. \u000A\u000AOnce it starts establishing itself, there\u0027s only so much you can do with it. You can\u0027t cry yourself to sleep every night because people from a distance hate you. So you gotta do with it what you can and if that means using it as motivation, then that\u0027s what you do.\u000A\u000ADo you feel you would\u0027ve been hated less if you went to another school? \u000A\u000AI think it would\u0027ve happened less if we just weren\u0027t winning so much. If I would\u0027ve went to Indiana but I was still at the Final Four every year, I think it still would\u0027ve happened.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re still mentioned on Twitter 75 times a day. Would you be even more hated today? \u000A\u000AProbably. I just challenge people to take me snowboarding or take me muskie fishing and then judge me. But don\u0027t judge me off a time when I was fighting. Do you hate Mike Tyson because he looks tough and like he wants to kill people when he\u0027s boxing? No, you don\u0027t. That\u0027s his job. That\u0027s what he\u0027s supposed to do. So do they hate the fact that I look like a good, wholesome white boy and maybe I wasn\u0027t that? That I was a vicious competitive, aggressive person? I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m sorry if the looks don\u0027t fit that mold, but that\u0027s what I was and that\u0027s what I loved about basketball. Everything is a fight out there. So if people got tired of seeing me fight out there, I\u0027m sorry. I apologize. I beg for your forgiveness. If you want me to go to church with you and do some penance for it, I will. But like I said, the main thing that allows me to sleep well at night is that you only want your fans to love you. I think I got that.\u000A\u000AYou are a good, wholesome white boy. Would you have been hated less if you were black?\u000A\u000A I have no idea. I don\u0027t think about it those terms. I think about more in the terms that you already said, about being on a different team without so much success. I don\u0027t know what would\u0027ve happened if I was black because I haven\u0027t walked in those shoes. The only way I think about it a little bit is because of the looks thing. When they talk about the choirboy looks, then they don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to be so vicious out there.\u000A\u000A _\u000A\u000A _Did you ever feel any animosity about being the \u0027Great White Hope\u0027?\u000A\u000A That might play into it a little bit, and then maybe I didn\u0027t do as well in the NBA as people wanted or expected me to do. Then maybe they felt like that gave them permission to hate me more. But you have to realize, I experienced so much success at Duke that it was hard to live up to those expectations. I never went around saying, \u0022We were only good at Duke because of me.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen I was in the NBA, I had thirteen coaches in thirteen years. Grant Hill had sixteen coaches in eighteen years. That turnover doesn\u0027t contribute to being very successful. So if I had to do it all over again, I would\u0027ve been more of an ass. At 24, I would\u0027ve called my agent and said, \u0022Don\u0027t put me on any team unless it\u0027s a Pat Riley team or a Larry Brown team or a Phil Jackson.\u0022 I wish I would\u0027ve done that. But at 24, you don\u0027t want to be calling your agent and telling him what to do. Because my ego was big, but it wasn\u0027t that big.\u000A\u000AYour high school team had a brawl with a neighboring black school. Your Duke teams were pitted against UNLV and the Fab Five. Did you ever feel any racial tension?\u000A\u000A It was all buildâ€”up hype by the media. I\u0027m sure UNLV and Tarkanian didn\u0027t talk about it too much. I know we didn\u0027t talk it too much. Coach K might\u0027ve mentioned it once. \u0022The media is making this good vs. bad and black vs. white. Don\u0027t get caught up in all that. This is basketball.\u0022 The same thing with the Fab Five. Coach K did a good job of not letting us fall in into that trap.\u000A\u000A The fans weren\u0027t always as mature.\u000A\u000A Of course. I went to school in North Carolina. Everywhere I went off campus there were UNC fans. There was a lot of that. But you take it for what it isâ€”fans of the opposing team that you\u0027re trying to beat every night. Just don\u0027t give it too much thought or lose any sleep over it. It\u0027s personal, but you can\u0027t control it. People are gonna have the perceptions that they want about you.\u000A\u000AMaybe people aren\u0027t going to church enough or talking about religion enough, but you learn from a very young age not to judge and especially don\u0027t judge from miles away. So I try to live my life like that and give people the benefit of the doubt. I even dealt with guys in the NBA like Jerry Stackhouse. He\u0027s a Carolina guy and you\u0027d think that we wouldn\u0027t get along. He and I got along very well when we were on the Pistons. We had one little altercation over cards because we\u0027re both fighters and alpha males. Then we had a bit of a falling out. But at the same time, I saw him interviewed a few years ago and the sportscasters were joking around about all the fights he got into. Then they asked him, \u0022Which one do you regret?\u0022 and he said \u0022The fight with Laettner.\u0022 That made me feel good \u0027cause I regretted we got in a fight because we were getting along so good. But that\u0027s just what happens.\u000A\u000AYou dealt with a lot of rumors from strangers about your relationship with Brian Davis that turned into homophobia.\u000A\u000A It lasted a little while. About four of five years. Then once I was in the NBA, I think it went away because people just knew that wasn\u0027t me. Then I got married and maybe it melted away after that. But that just happened because I said one silly thing to Curry Kirkpatrick when I was a senior and he\u0027s like the biggest Carolina fan. So I think he spun it out of context. He asked me something like, \u0022What are you doing this summer?\u0022 I was like, \u0022I just wanna hang out here with Brian.\u0022 Brian was sitting right there and we laughed about it. Then it turns into this whole \u0022Christian is Gay\u0022 thing. That was the stupidest thing ever and I never really put any thought into it.\u000A\u000AIt went beyond the pale, but I never said to myself that it was too much. It was just perception, not the truth. I know what I am. It was really easy to let that roll off my shoulder, but at the same time, it didn\u0027t feel good. I got teased about it. I would walk into arenas and all the fans would chant it. Then I\u0027d be on campus and the football players would say it. That wasn\u0027t cool. But it wasn\u0027t that hurtful.\u000A\u000ASpeaking of hurtful, you played with Michael Jordan twice. Once on the Dream Team, then again in his final years with the Wizards. How was that?\u000A\u000A He wasn\u0027t like that on the Dream Team because he didn\u0027t need to be. He was just fitting in. Except that one practice in Monte Carlo everyone talks about: \u0022The Greatest Practice Ever\u0022â€”that was the day before. The next day, we tried to have another good practice, but Michael and Magic turned it into mano a mano. It was so bad, Larry Bird just walked off the court. He was like, \u0022I\u0027m not gonna play with a bad back just to watch these guys go one-on-one the whole time.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen he was with the Wizards, he was 40, so some of that probably calmed down a little bit. He was just trying to survive and not get hurt to play the next day. So I didn\u0027t see so much of it then. But we\u0027ve all heard about his days with the Bulls and getting into fights with his teammates. He might get a pass for that and that\u0027s fine. I\u0027m not asking for a pass. But it\u0027s like, what do you think is happening on these great teams? Do you think it\u0027s \u0022Kumbaya\u0022 all the time? Or do you think it\u0027s people pushing and challenging each other to be the best they can? I know Michael did that. I know I did that on my Duke teams and maybe I didn\u0027t do it enough in the NBA.\u000A\u000AWhy not?\u000A\u000A Because everyone\u0027s so good you don\u0027t have to do it. When I\u0027m a senior at Duke and Cherokee Parks walks in, we\u0027re gonna need him and he has to get tougher to play in the ACC. When I go out of a game because of fouls or whatever, I don\u0027t want the level of play to go way down. So you gotta toughen him up, just like Quin Snyder and Danny Ferry toughened me up when I was a freshman. So now you get to the NBA and everyone is so good you don\u0027t have to toughen them up at all.\u000A\u000A You might be the most hated player in NCAA history. Who did you hate?\u000A\u000A I hated everybody when I was playing. I needed to play with that overly competitive, fighting spirit to be the best player I could be. I\u0027m not always the biggest or most athletic, so I need that extra competitive fire to propel me into playing really good basketball. So I hated everybody.",

basketball fan, and especially if you&#x2019;re a basketball fan who didn&#x2019;t go to Duke, chances are you hate Christian Laettner. Maybe it&#x2019;s because every season he spent there ended with him in the Final Four. Maybe it&#x2019;s because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3_IT622Sbc">The Shot</a> against Kentucky. Or maybe it&#x2019;s for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AwYVTB2rZw">The Stomp</a> before The Shot. But that&#x2019;s okay. Laettner didn&#x2019;t want your love. He wanted to win.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.2"> Just in time for another round of March Madness, ESPN presents their latest in their celebrated 30-for-30 sports documentary series, <em>I Hate Christian Laettner</em>, airing this Sunday, shortly after this year&#x2019;s brackets are unveiled. After discussing the movie with Laettner, we think you should watch it. Maybe you&#x2019;ll feel differently about him. Probably not.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.3"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong><em> </em></strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong><em>GQ:</em> It&#x2019;s been more than two decades since you graduated from Duke. Why did you decide to make this documentary now? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Laettner: </strong>I didn&#x2019;t want to do it. ESPN just approached me last summer and said, &quot;We want to make a movie about you.&quot; So it wasn&#x2019;t up to me, but of course I said yes. They didn&#x2019;t tell me the name of the title at that point, but I did all the interviews for it and gave the director, Rory Karpf, names to talk to so he could access my parents, siblings, and some other friends.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.8">That all went well. Then Rory called me and said, &quot;We&#x2019;re gonna name it,</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.9"><em>I Hate Christian Laettner</em></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.a">&quot; and I laughed at first, because I understand it. People might have gotten tired of seeing my face and my Duke teams at the Final Four four years in a row. When you achieve that level of success, some people get envious. That&#x2019;s all fine and dandy if I live in a vacuum. But I don&#x2019;t. I have children, I have a wife, I have friends who don&#x2019;t necessarily like the title.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.b">My father said, &quot;Why can&#x2019;t they name it, &#x2019;One of Duke&#x2019;s Best&#x2019;?&quot; My answer to him was, &quot;It&#x2019;s not provocative.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>What are you hoping this accomplishes? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.d">I don&#x2019;t know if there&#x2019;s anything&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just an honor to have ESPN want to make a movie about you. Part of me would like for not all the Kentucky, Carolina, and Connecticut fans to despise me, but another part of me realizes that&#x2019;s not important. It&#x2019;s not good to be a hater. Hopefully that&#x2019;s what people will take away from it.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Did you want to be hated? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.f">No one wants to be hated. All I wanted to do was win. People have to remember that when I came to Duke, they&#x2019;d started to get a reputation that they can&#x2019;t win the big game. We were aware of that and we hated it. Coach K would always talk to us about having to be tougher minded, tougher physically, more intense, more passionate. I maybe took it to another level, where I was really tough on my teammates. But I don&#x2019;t know why people were acting like they were so shocked.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>But you liked wearing the black hat. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.h">Once it starts establishing itself, there&#x2019;s only so much you can do with it. You can&#x2019;t cry yourself to sleep every night because people from a distance hate you. So you gotta do with it what you can and if that means using it as motivation, then that&#x2019;s what you do.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Do you feel you would&#x2019;ve been hated less if you went to another school? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.j">I think it would&#x2019;ve happened less if we just weren&#x2019;t winning so much. If I would&#x2019;ve went to Indiana but I was still at the Final Four every year, I think it still would&#x2019;ve happened.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>You&#x2019;re still mentioned on Twitter 75 times a day. Would you be even more hated today? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.l">Probably. I just challenge people to take me snowboarding or take me muskie fishing and then judge me. But don&#x2019;t judge me off a time when I was fighting. Do you hate Mike Tyson because he looks tough and like he wants to kill people when he&#x2019;s boxing? No, you don&#x2019;t. That&#x2019;s his job. That&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;s supposed to do. So do they hate the fact that I look like a good, wholesome white boy and maybe I wasn&#x2019;t that? That I was a vicious competitive, aggressive person? I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;m sorry if the looks don&#x2019;t fit that mold, but that&#x2019;s what I was and that&#x2019;s what I loved about basketball. Everything is a fight out there. So if people got tired of seeing me fight out there, I&#x2019;m sorry. I apologize. I beg for your forgiveness. If you want me to go to church with you and do some penance for it, I will. But like I said, the main thing that allows me to sleep well at night is that you only want your fans to love you. I think I got that.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>You are a good, wholesome white boy. Would you have been hated less if you were black?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.n"> I have no idea. I don&#x2019;t think about it those terms. I think about more in the terms that you already said, about being on a different team without so much success. I don&#x2019;t know what would&#x2019;ve happened if I was black because I haven&#x2019;t walked in those shoes. The only way I think about it a little bit is because of the looks thing. When they talk about the choirboy looks, then they don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re going to be so vicious out there.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.o"> _</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.p"> _<strong>Did you ever feel any animosity about being the &#x2019;Great White Hope&#x2019;?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.q"> That might play into it a little bit, and then maybe I didn&#x2019;t do as well in the NBA as people wanted or expected me to do. Then maybe they felt like that gave them permission to hate me more. But you have to realize, I experienced so much success at Duke that it was hard to live up to those expectations. I never went around saying, &quot;We were only good at Duke because of me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.r">When I was in the NBA, I had thirteen coaches in thirteen years. Grant Hill had sixteen coaches in eighteen years. That turnover doesn&#x2019;t contribute to being very successful. So if I had to do it all over again, I would&#x2019;ve been more of an ass. At 24, I would&#x2019;ve called my agent and said, &quot;Don&#x2019;t put me on any team unless it&#x2019;s a Pat Riley team or a Larry Brown team or a Phil Jackson.&quot; I wish I would&#x2019;ve done that. But at 24, you don&#x2019;t want to be calling your agent and telling him what to do. Because my ego was big, but it wasn&#x2019;t that big.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>Your high school team had a brawl with a neighboring black school. Your Duke teams were pitted against UNLV and the Fab Five. Did you ever feel any racial tension?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.t"> It was all build&#x2014;up hype by the media. I&#x2019;m sure UNLV and Tarkanian didn&#x2019;t talk about it too much. I know we didn&#x2019;t talk it too much. Coach K might&#x2019;ve mentioned it once. &quot;The media is making this good vs. bad and black vs. white. Don&#x2019;t get caught up in all that. This is basketball.&quot; The same thing with the Fab Five. Coach K did a good job of not letting us fall in into that trap.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.u"> <strong>The fans weren&#x2019;t always as mature.</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.v"> Of course. I went to school in North Carolina. Everywhere I went off campus there were UNC fans. There was a lot of that. But you take it for what it is&#x2014;fans of the opposing team that you&#x2019;re trying to beat every night. Just don&#x2019;t give it too much thought or lose any sleep over it. It&#x2019;s personal, but you can&#x2019;t control it. People are gonna have the perceptions that they want about you.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.w">Maybe people aren&#x2019;t going to church enough or talking about religion enough, but you learn from a very young age not to judge and especially don&#x2019;t judge from miles away. So I try to live my life like that and give people the benefit of the doubt. I even dealt with guys in the NBA like Jerry Stackhouse. He&#x2019;s a Carolina guy and you&#x2019;d think that we wouldn&#x2019;t get along. He and I got along very well when we were on the Pistons. We had one little altercation over cards because we&#x2019;re both fighters and alpha males. Then we had a bit of a falling out. But at the same time, I saw him interviewed a few years ago and the sportscasters were joking around about all the fights he got into. Then they asked him, &quot;Which one do you regret?&quot; and he said &quot;The fight with Laettner.&quot; That made me feel good &#x2019;cause I regretted we got in a fight because we were getting along so good. But that&#x2019;s just what happens.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>You dealt with a lot of rumors from strangers about your relationship with Brian Davis that turned into homophobia.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.y"> It lasted a little while. About four of five years. Then once I was in the NBA, I think it went away because people just knew that wasn&#x2019;t me. Then I got married and maybe it melted away after that. But that just happened because I said one silly thing to Curry Kirkpatrick when I was a senior and he&#x2019;s like the biggest Carolina fan. So I think he spun it out of context. He asked me something like, &quot;What are you doing this summer?&quot; I was like, &quot;I just wanna hang out here with Brian.&quot; Brian was sitting right there and we laughed about it. Then it turns into this whole &quot;Christian is Gay&quot; thing. That was the stupidest thing ever and I never really put any thought into it.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.z">It went beyond the pale, but I never said to myself that it was too much. It was just perception, not the truth. I know what I am. It was really easy to let that roll off my shoulder, but at the same time, it didn&#x2019;t feel good. I got teased about it. I would walk into arenas and all the fans would chant it. Then I&#x2019;d be on campus and the football players would say it. That wasn&#x2019;t cool. But it wasn&#x2019;t that hurtful.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong>Speaking of hurtful, you played with Michael Jordan twice. Once on the Dream Team, then again in his final years with the Wizards. How was that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.11"> He wasn&#x2019;t like that on the Dream Team because he didn&#x2019;t need to be. He was just fitting in. Except that one practice in Monte Carlo everyone talks about: &quot;The Greatest Practice Ever&quot;&#x2014;that was the day before. The next day, we tried to have another good practice, but Michael and Magic turned it into mano a mano. It was so bad, Larry Bird just walked off the court. He was like, &quot;I&#x2019;m not gonna play with a bad back just to watch these guys go one-on-one the whole time.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.12">When he was with the Wizards, he was 40, so some of that probably calmed down a little bit. He was just trying to survive and not get hurt to play the next day. So I didn&#x2019;t see so much of it then. But we&#x2019;ve all heard about his days with the Bulls and getting into fights with his teammates. He might get a pass for that and that&#x2019;s fine. I&#x2019;m not asking for a pass. But it&#x2019;s like, what do you think is happening on these great teams? Do you think it&#x2019;s &quot;Kumbaya&quot; all the time? Or do you think it&#x2019;s people pushing and challenging each other to be the best they can? I know Michael did that. I know I did that on my Duke teams and maybe I didn&#x2019;t do it enough in the NBA.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>Why not?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.14"> Because everyone&#x2019;s so good you don&#x2019;t have to do it. When I&#x2019;m a senior at Duke and Cherokee Parks walks in, we&#x2019;re gonna need him and he has to get tougher to play in the ACC. When I go out of a game because of fouls or whatever, I don&#x2019;t want the level of play to go way down. So you gotta toughen him up, just like Quin Snyder and Danny Ferry toughened me up when I was a freshman. So now you get to the NBA and everyone is so good you don&#x2019;t have to toughen them up at all.</p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.15"> <strong>You might be the most hated player in NCAA history. Who did you hate?</strong><strong></strong></p><p data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.4.16"> I hated everybody when I was playing. I needed to play with that overly competitive, fighting spirit to be the best player I could be. I&#x2019;m not always the biggest or most athletic, so I need that extra competitive fire to propel me into playing really good basketball. So I hated everybody.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".d9brtue7ls.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
