Her security detail suggests that it\u0027s probably not a paparazzo because there\u0027s no way a paparazzo could find us at such an unglamorous, unassuming establishment. But as with seemingly every other inference she has ever made, Taylor Swift is ultimately proven right. The guy in the gray car is taking her picture. This annoys her, but just barely.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s August in Southern California. We crawl into the back of a massive Toyota and start driving to Swift\u0027s West Coast residence, located in a rural enclave of Beverly Hills. The gray car trails us through Franklin Canyon. Swift whips out her phone and starts showing me images from the video shoot for \u0022Wildest Dreams,\u0022 including a clip of a giraffe licking her face. She has more photos on her phone than any person I\u0027ve ever met. \u0022I wanted this video to be about the making of a 1950s movie being filmed on location in Africa,\u0022 she explains. Swift came up with the concept after reading a book by Ava Gardner and Peter Evans, The Secret Conversations. Her premise for the video (co-starring Clint Eastwood\u0027s son) is that—since social media did not exist in the \u002750s—it would be impossible for actors not to fall in love if they were isolated together in Africa, since there would be no one else to talk to.\u000A\u000AWe chat a little about Ryan Adams and a little about books. Swift mentions that she wrote a non-autobiographical novel when she was 14, titled A Girl Named Girl, and that her parents still have it. I ask her what it was about, assuming she will laugh. But her memory of the plot is remarkably detailed. (It\u0027s about a mother who wants a son but instead has a girl.) If she released it today, it would immediately be the best-selling YA novel in the nation. When she was about that same age, Swift\u0027s family moved from Pennsylvania to Nashville, to jump-start her music career. I ask what she imagines might have happened if they\u0027d never moved and if she\u0027d never become an artist. \u0022I would still be involved with music in my spare time,\u0022 she says. \u0022But I would have gone to college, and I would probably be involved with a form of business where words and ideas are at the forefront. Such as marketing.\u0022 She returns to her phone and starts scrolling for an old voice memo she sent to Jack Antonoff of the band Bleachers while they were co-writing songs for 1989. Antonoff\u0027s nickname for Swift is Dead Tooth, a reference to a minor dental mishap. Just as she tells me this, her cell phone rings. The display panel says the incoming call is from J TIMB. \u0022Oh, my God. Justin Timberlake?\u0022 Her surprise does not seem artificial. \u0022Can I take this?\u0022\u000A\u000AShe takes the call. The volume on her phone is loud enough for me to intermittently hear both sides of the conversation. Swift explains that she\u0027s driving to her house, but that she can\u0027t actually stay there because contractors are renovating almost every room. \u0022Have you ever seen the movie The Money Pit?\u0022 asks Timberlake. She has not, so Timberlake provides a capsule review. He has a 4-month-old baby at home and is constantly tired, yet he can\u0027t fall sleep. He asks Swift for advice on sleeping. Swift tells the driver to pull over to the shoulder of the road, since she keeps losing reception as we drive through the canyon. The paparazzo in the gray car casually passes, having not-so-casually followed us for at least five miles.\u000A\u000ASee Taylor Swift\u0027s Stunning GQ Photo Shoot\u000A\u000AThe conversation lasts almost 15 minutes (which is a little weird, since I\u0027m just sitting there beside her, openly taking notes). \u0022You\u0027re never going to get old,\u0022 Swift assures Timberlake. \u0022That\u0027s scientific fact. That\u0027s medical.\u0022 Even her sarcasm is aspirational. Eventually JT tells her the reason he\u0027s calling is because he wants to perform the song \u0022Mirrors\u0022 with her on the last night of her upcoming five-date stand at Staples Center. (Late in every concert, Swift brings a surprise guest onstage.) She reacts to this news the way a teenage girl in Nebraska would react if suddenly informed that a paternity test had revealed Taylor Swift was her biological sister.\u000A\u000AWhen she ends the call, Swift looks at me and says, \u0022This is so crazy. This is so crazy.\u0022 She repeats that phrase four times, each time with ascending volume.\u000A\u000ANow, inside my skull, I am thinking one thought: This is not remotely crazy. It actually seems like the opposite of crazy. Why wouldn\u0027t Justin Timberlake want to perform with the biggest entertainer in America, to an audience of 15,000 people who will lose their collective mind the moment he appears? I\u0027d have been much more surprised if he\u0027d called to turn her down. But then I remember that Swift is 25 years old, and that her entire ethos is based on experiencing (and interpreting) how her insane life would feel if she were exactly like the type of person who\u0027d buy a ticket to this particular concert. She has more perspective than I do. Every extension of who she is and how she works is (indeed) \u0022so crazy,\u0022 and what\u0027s even crazier is my inability to recognize just how crazy it is.\u000A\u000ASo Taylor Swift is right again.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIf you don\u0027t take Swift seriously, you don\u0027t take contemporary music seriously. With the (arguable) exceptions of Kanye West and Beyoncé Knowles, she is the most significant pop artist of the modern age. The scale of her commercial supremacy defies parallel—she\u0027s sold 1 million albums in a week three times, during an era when most major artists are thrilled to move 500,000 albums in a year. If a record as comparatively dominant as 1989 had actually existed in the year 1989, it would have surpassed the sales of Thriller. There is no demographic she does not tap into, which is obviously rare. But what\u0027s even more atypical is how that ubiquity is critically received. Swift gets excellent reviews, particularly from the most significant arbiters of taste. (A 2011 New Yorker piece conceded that Swift\u0027s reviews are \u0022almost uniformly positive.\u0022) She has never gratuitously sexualized her image and seems pathologically averse to controversy. There\u0027s simply no antecedent for this kind of career: a cross-genre, youth-oriented, critically acclaimed colossus based entirely on the intuitive songwriting merits of a single female artist. It\u0027s as if mid-period Garth Brooks was also early Liz Phair, minus the hat and the swearing. As a phenomenon, it\u0027s absolutely new.\u000A\u000AAnd this, somewhat predictably, creates a new set of problems.\u000A\u000AEven within the most high-minded considerations of Swift\u0027s music, there is inevitably some analysis (or speculation) about her personal life. She\u0027s an utterly credible musician who is consumed as a tabloid personality. Very often (and not without justification), that binary is attributed to ingrained biases against female performers. But it\u0027s more complicated than that. Swift writes about her life so directly that the listener is forced to think about her persona in order to fully appreciate what she\u0027s doing creatively. This is her greatest power: an ability to combine her art and her life so profoundly that both spheres become more interesting to everyone, regardless of their emotional investment in either.\u000A\u000ASwift clearly knows this is happening. But she can\u0027t directly admit it, because it\u0027s the kind of thing that only works when it seems accidental. She\u0027s careful how she describes the process, because you don\u0027t become who she is by describing things carelessly.\u000A\u000AEven the most serious critics inevitably discuss the more tabloid aspects of your life. Is this valid? Does the fact that you write about yourself in such a confessional style require intelligent people to look at your music through that lens?I don\u0027t feel there is any injustice when people expand beyond my music and speculate on who certain songs might be about. I\u0027ve never named names, so I feel like I still have a sense of power over what people say—even if that isn\u0027t true, and even if I don\u0027t have any power over what people say about me. The fact that I\u0027ve never confirmed who those songs are about makes me feel like there is still one card I\u0027m holding. So if you\u0027re going to look at your life and say, \u0022I get to play sold-out football stadiums all over the world. I get to call up my favorite artists and ask them to perform with me, and most of the time they say yes. I get to be on the cover of this magazine\u0022—this is all because I write songs about my own life. So I would feel a little strange complaining about how it\u0027s covered.\u000A\u000ABut I\u0027m not asking if it\u0027s fair or unfair, or if the downside is worth the upside. I\u0027m asking from an aesthetic perspective: Is thinking about your real life an essential part of appreciating your music? Could your music be enjoyed the same way in a vacuum, even if no one knew anything else about you?\u0022Shake It Off\u0022 is one of my most successful songs, and that has nothing directly, intricately, pointedly personal in it. No one really says I stay out too late. I just thought it sounded good.\u000A\u000AHave you ever stopped yourself from writing a fictional lyric because you feared it would be incorrectly applied to your nonfictional life?No. Some of the things I write about on a song like \u0022Blank Space\u0022 are satire. You take your creative license and create things that are larger than life. You can write things like I get drunk on jealousy but you\u0027ll come back each time you leave, \u0027cause darling I\u0027m a nightmare dressed like a daydream. That is not my approach to relationships. But is it cool to write the narrative of a girl who\u0027s crazy but seductive but glamorous but nuts but manipulative? That was the character I felt the media had written for me, and for a long time I felt hurt by it. I took it personally. But as time went by, I realized it was kind of hilarious.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s impossible for an artist to control how she is perceived. But an artist can anticipate those perceptions, which is almost as good. \u0022A nuanced sense of humor does not translate on a general scale,\u0022 Swift says, \u0022and I knew that going in. I knew some people would hear ‘Blank Space\u0027 and say, See, we were right about her. And at that point, I just figure if you don\u0027t get the joke, you don\u0027t deserve to get the joke.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a long tradition of musicians expressing (or pretending to express) a degree of disinterest in how they are metabolized by the culture. They claim to ignore their own reviews while feigning a lack of discernment about what their audience wants or expects, since these are things that cannot be manipulated. Swift is not like this. She has an extrinsic focus that informs her creative process. From her perspective, not tracking how people view your work feels stranger than the alternative.\u000A\u000A\u0022I went through a few years where I just never went online and never looked at blogs,\u0022 she recalls. \u0022This was around 2013, when the only thing anyone wanted to write about me was about me and some guy. It was really damaging. You\u0027re thinking, ‘Everybody goes on dates when they\u0027re 22. It\u0027s fine, right?\u0027 Nope. Not when you\u0027re in this situation, and everything you do is blown out of proportion and expanded upon. And all of a sudden, there\u0027s an overriding opinion that doesn\u0027t accurately reflect how you actually live your life. So I didn\u0027t go online for a year and a half. I actually forgot my Instagram password. But now I check in and see what\u0027s happening. In 2015, that stuff does matter. Because if enough people say the same thing about me, it becomes fact in the general public\u0027s mind. So I monitor what people say about me, and if I see a theme, I know what that means. I\u0027ve had it happen twice before. In 2010, it was She\u0027s too young to get all these awards. Look how annoying she is when she wins. Is she even good? And then in 2013, it was She just writes songs about guys to get revenge. She\u0027s boy-crazy. She\u0027s a problematic person. It will probably be something else again this year.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022To me, the safest thing I could do was take the biggest risk. I know\u000Ahow to write a song. I\u0027m not confident about a lot of other aspects of\u000Amy life, but I know how to write a song.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000AHow you view this level of consciousness is proportional to how you feel about Swift as a public figure. There is a perpetual sense that nothing about her career is accidental and that nothing about her life is unmediated. These are not unusual thoughts to have about young mainstream stars. But what\u0027s different with Swift is her autonomy. There is no Svengali directing her career; there is no stage mother pushing her toward the spotlight. She is in total control of her own constructed reality. If there was a machine that built humans out of positive millennial stereotypes, Swift would be its utopian creation.\u000A\u000A\u0022I used to watch Behind the Music every day,\u0022 she says. (Her favorite episode was the one about the Bangles.) \u0022When other kids were watching normal shows, I\u0027d watch Behind the Music. And I would see these bands that were doing so well, and I\u0027d wonder what went wrong. I thought about this a lot. And what I established in my brain was that a lack of self-awareness was always the downfall. That was always the catalyst for the loss of relevance and the loss of ambition and the loss of great art. So self-awareness has been such a huge part of what I try to achieve on a daily basis. It\u0027s less about reputation management and strategy and vanity than it is about trying to desperately preserve self-awareness, since that seems to be the first thing to go out the door when people find success.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe advantage of this self-focused fixation is clear. Swift is allowed to make whatever record she wants, based on the reasonable argument that she understands her specific space in the culture more deeply than anyone around her. The making of 1989 is a prime example: She claims everyone at her label (the Nashville-based Big Machine) tried to persuade her not to make a straightforward pop album. She recounts a litany of arguments with various label executives over every possible detail, from how much of her face would appear on the cover to how co-writer Max Martin would be credited in the liner notes.\u000A\u000AAs far as I can tell, Swift won every one of these debates.\u000A\u000A\u0022Even calling this record 1989 was a risk,\u0022 she says. \u0022I had so many intense conversations where my label really tried to step in. I could tell they\u0027d all gotten together and decided, ‘We gotta talk some sense into her. She\u0027s had an established, astronomically successful career in country music. To shake that up would be the biggest mistake she ever makes.\u0027 But to me, the safest thing I could do was take the biggest risk. I know how to write a song. I\u0027m not confident about a lot of other aspects of my life, but I know how to write a song. I\u0027d read a review of [2012\u0027s] Red that said it wasn\u0027t sonically cohesive. So that was what I wanted on 1989: an umbrella that would go over all of these songs, so that they all belonged on the same album. But then I\u0027d go into the label office, and they were like, ‘Can we talk about putting a fiddle and a steel-guitar solo on ‘Shake It Off\u0027 to service country radio?\u0027 I was trying to make the most honest record I could possibly make, and they were kind of asking me to be a little disingenuous about it: ‘Let\u0027s capitalize on both markets.\u0027 No, let\u0027s not. Let\u0027s choose a lane.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ALike almost all famous people, Swift has two ways of speaking. The first is the way she talks when she\u0027s actively shaping the interview—optimistic, animated, and seemingly rehearsed (even when that\u0027s impossible). The second is the way she talks when she cares less about the way the words are presented and more about the message itself (chin slightly down, brow slightly furrowed, timbre slightly deeper). The first way is how she talks when she\u0027s on television; the second is unequivocal and less animatronic. But she oscillates between the two styles fluidly, because either (a) this dissonance is less intentional than it appears or (b) she can tell I\u0027m considerably more interested in anything delivered in the second style.\u000A\u000A\u0022Am I shooting from the hip?\u0022 she asks rhetorically. \u0022Would any of\u000Athis have happened if I was?\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000ALate in our lunch, I mention something that happened several years ago: By chance, I\u0027d found myself having dinner with a former acquaintance of Swift\u0027s who offhandedly described her as \u0022calculating.\u0022 This is the only moment during our interview when Swift appears remotely flustered. She really, really hates the word calculating. She despises how it has become tethered to her iconography and believes the person I met has been the singular voice regurgitating this categorization. As she explains these things, her speech does not oscillate from the second mode.\u000A\u000A\u0022Am I shooting from the hip?\u0022 she asks rhetorically. \u0022Would any of this have happened if I was? In that sense, I do think about things before they happen. But here was someone taking a positive thing—the fact that I think about things and that I care about my work—and trying to make that into an insinuation about my personal life. Highly offensive. You can be accidentally successful for three or four years. Accidents happen. But careers take hard work.\u0022\u000A\u000ASee Taylor Swift\u0027s Stunning GQ Photo Shoot\u000A\u000AHere we see Swift\u0027s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated. Because Swift\u0027s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it\u0027s assumed that her social life is no less premeditated. This even applies to casual, non-romantic relationships. Over the past three years, Swift has built a volunteer army of high-profile friends, many of whom appear in her videos and serve as special guests at her concerts. In almost any other circumstance, this would be seen as a likable trait; Leonardo DiCaprio behaved similarly in the \u002790s, and everyone thought it was awesome. But it\u0027s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice League (\u0022the ectomorph model,\u0022 \u0022the inventive indie artist,\u0022 \u0022the informed third-wave feminist,\u0022 etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is genuinely obsessed with these attachments. \u0022I honestly think my lack of female friendships in high school and middle school is why my female friendships are so important now,\u0022 she says. \u0022Because I always wanted them. It was just hard for me to have friends.\u0022\u000A\u000APopular people often claim they were once unpopular, so I ask Swift for a specific example. She tells a story about middle school, when she called several of her peers on the phone and asked if they wanted to go shopping. Every girl had a different excuse for why she couldn\u0027t go. Eventually, Swift\u0027s mother agreed to take her to the local mall. When they arrived, Swift saw all of the girls she had called on the phone, goofing around in Victoria\u0027s Secret. \u0022I just remember my mom looking at me and saying, We\u0027re going to King of Prussia Mall. Which is the big, big mall in Pennsylvania, 45 minutes away. So we left and went to the better mall. My mom let me escape from certain things that were too painful to deal with. And we talked about it the whole ride there, and we had a good time shopping.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis incident appears to be the genesis for a verse in her 2008 song \u0022The Best Day,\u0022 a connection she doesn\u0027t note when she tells me the story. A cynical person could read something into this anecdote and turn it into a metaphor about capitalism or parenting or creativity or Pennsylvania. But in the framework of our conversation, it did not seem metaphoric of anything. It just seemed like a (very real) memory that might be more internally motivating than any simplistic desire for money or power.\u000A\u000ASo is it unfair to categorize Swift as calculating? Maybe, and particularly if you view that term as exclusively pejorative. But calling her guileless would be even crazier. Swift views her lyrics as the most important part of her art (\u0022The lyrics are what I want you to focus on,\u0022 she asserts), so we spend some time parsing specific passages from specific songs. Here is how she dissects the conjecture over \u0022Bad Blood,\u0022 a single universally assumed to be about Katy Perry.\u000A\u000AYou never say who your songs are about, but you concede that if enough people believe something, it essentially becomes fact. So by not saying who you\u0027re writing about, aren\u0027t you allowing public consensus to dictate the meaning of your work? If everyone assumes that \u0022Bad Blood\u0022 is about a specific person, aren\u0027t you allowing the culture to create a fact about your life?You\u0027re in a Rolling Stone interview, and the writer says, \u0022Who is that song about? That sounds like a really intense moment from your life.\u0022 And you sit there, and you know you\u0027re on good terms with your ex-boyfriend, and you don\u0027t want him—or his family—to think you\u0027re firing shots at him. So you say, \u0022That was about losing a friend.\u0022 And that\u0027s basically all you say. But then people cryptically tweet about what you meant. I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that. I knew the song would be assigned to a person, and the easiest mark was someone who I didn\u0027t want to be labeled with this song. It was not a song about heartbreak. It was about the loss of friendship.\u000A\u000ABut nobody thinks that song is about a guy.But they would have. So I don\u0027t necessarily care who people think it\u0027s about. I just needed to divert them away from the easiest target. Listen to the song. It doesn\u0027t point to any one person or any one situation. But if you\u0027d listened to my previous four albums, you would think this was about a guy who broke my heart. And nothing could be further from the truth. It was important to show that losing friendships can be just as damaging to a person as losing a romantic relationship.\u000A\u000ANow, there are more than a few molecules of bullshit in this response. When Swift says, \u0022And that\u0027s basically all you say,\u0022 she\u0027s neglecting to mention that she also told the reporter that the disharmony stemmed from a business conflict, and that the individual in question tried to sabotage an arena tour by hiring away some of her employees. These details dramatically reduce the pool of potential candidates. Yet consider the strategy\u0027s larger brilliance: In order to abort the possibility of a rumor she did not want, she propagated the existence of a different rumor that offered the added value of making the song more interesting.\u000A\u000ASwift can manufacture the kind of mythology that used to happen to Carly Simon by accident.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASpeaking of accidents, here\u0027s some breaking news: They happen to Taylor Swift, too. She believes the most consequential accident of her professional life was when Kanye West famously stormed the stage during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. I\u0027m surprised when she brings this up unprompted, because she has barely addressed the incident in five years, aside from the (comically undisguised) song \u0022Innocent.\u0022 But fences have been mended and feelings have been felt. At this summer\u0027s VMAs, Swift warmly presented West with the Video Vanguard trophy. She\u0027ll probably serve as Secretary of the Interior when he becomes president.\u000A\u000ASwift analyzes her friendships so often that I eventually ask what\u000Aseems like an obvious question: Does she ever feel lonely? She\u000Aresponds by literally talking about Friends.Twitter\u000A\u000ASwift was lauded for handling West\u0027s \u002709 intrusion with grace and composure, but her personal memories of the event dwell on the bewilderment. When West first jumped onstage, Swift halfway assumed he was about to make a special presentation, honoring her for being the first country artist to ever win a VMA. She truly had no idea what was transpiring. \u0022When the crowd started booing, I thought they were booing because they also believed I didn\u0027t deserve the award. That\u0027s where the hurt came from. I went backstage and cried, and then I had to stop crying and perform five minutes later. I just told myself I had to perform, and I tried to convince myself that maybe this wasn\u0027t that big of a deal. But that was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career. And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other—that\u0027s one of my favorite things that has happened in my career.\u0022\u000A\u000ASwift analyzes her friendships so often that I eventually ask what seems like an obvious question: Does she ever feel lonely? She responds by literally talking about Friends. \u0022I\u0027m around people so much,\u0022 she says. \u0022Massive amounts of people. I do a meet-and-greet every night on the tour, and it\u0027s 150 people. Before that, it\u0027s a radio meet-and-greet with 40 people. After the show, it\u0027s 30 or 40 more people. So then when I go home and turn on the TV, and I\u0027ve got Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel and Phoebe and Joey on a Friends marathon, I don\u0027t feel lonely. I\u0027ve just been onstage for two hours, talking to 60,000 people about my feelings. That\u0027s so much social stimulation. When I get home, there is not one part of me that wishes I was around other people.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis is understandable. Still, I note something any musician obsessed with self-awareness would undoubtedly recognize: In the retrospective context of a hypothetical Behind the Music episode, this anecdote would be framed as depressing. It would paint the portrait of a super-famous entertainer spending her day emoting to thousands of strangers, only to return home to an empty house and the one-way company of two-dimensional characters.\u000A\u000ADoes she not see the irony?\u000A\u000AOh, she sees it. But that doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s real.\u000A\u000A\u0022There is such a thing as having enough,\u0022 she says in her non-TV voice. \u0022You might think a meet-and-greet with 150 people sounds sad, because maybe you think I\u0027m forced to do it. But you would be surprised. A meaningful conversation doesn\u0027t mean that conversation has to last an hour. A meet-and-greet might sound weird to someone who\u0027s never done one, but after ten years, you learn to appreciate happiness when it happens, and that happiness is rare and fleeting, and that you\u0027re not entitled to it. You know, during the first few years of your career, the only thing anyone says to you is ‘Enjoy this. Just enjoy this.\u0027 That\u0027s all they ever tell you. And I finally know how to do that.\u0022\u000A\u000ATaylor Swift is 25. But she\u0027s older than you.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AChuck Klosterman (@CKlosterman) is the author of eight books, most recently I Wear the Black Hat: Grappling with Villains (Real and Imagined).\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A",

Her security detail suggests that it&#x2019;s probably not a paparazzo because there&#x2019;s no way a paparazzo could find us at such an unglamorous, unassuming establishment. But as with seemingly every other inference she has ever made, Taylor Swift is ultimately proven right. The guy in the gray car is taking her picture. This annoys her, but just barely.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.3">It&#x2019;s August in Southern California. We crawl into the back of a massive Toyota and start driving to Swift&#x2019;s West Coast residence, located in a rural enclave of Beverly Hills. The gray car trails us through Franklin Canyon. Swift whips out her phone and starts showing me images from the video shoot for &#x201C;Wildest Dreams,&#x201D; including a clip of a giraffe licking her face. She has more photos on her phone than any person I&#x2019;ve ever met. &#x201C;I wanted this video to be about the making of a 1950s movie being filmed on location in Africa,&#x201D; she explains. Swift came up with the concept after reading a book by Ava Gardner and Peter Evans, <em>The Secret Conversations.</em> Her premise for the video (co-starring Clint Eastwood&#x2019;s son) is that&#x2014;since social media did not exist in the &#x2019;50s&#x2014;it would be impossible for actors not to fall in love if they were isolated together in Africa, since there would be no one else to talk to.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.5">We chat a little about Ryan Adams and a little about books. Swift mentions that she wrote a non-autobiographical novel when she was 14, titled <em>A Girl Named Girl,</em> and that her parents still have it. I ask her what it was about, assuming she will laugh. But her memory of the plot is remarkably detailed. (It&#x2019;s about a mother who wants a son but instead has a girl.) If she released it today, it would immediately be the best-selling YA novel in the nation. When she was about that same age, Swift&#x2019;s family moved from Pennsylvania to Nashville, to jump-start her music career. I ask what she imagines might have happened if they&#x2019;d never moved and if she&#x2019;d never become an artist. &#x201C;I would still be involved with music in my spare time,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;But I would have gone to college, and I would probably be involved with a form of business where words and ideas are at the forefront. Such as marketing.&#x201D; She returns to her phone and starts scrolling for an old voice memo she sent to Jack Antonoff of the band Bleachers while they were co-writing songs for <em>1989.</em> Antonoff&#x2019;s nickname for Swift is Dead Tooth, a reference to a minor dental mishap. Just as she tells me this, her cell phone rings. The display panel says the incoming call is from J TIMB. &#x201C;Oh, my God. <a href="justin-timberlake-men-of-the-year-hashtag">Justin Timberlake</a>?&#x201D; Her surprise does not seem artificial. &#x201C;Can I take this?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.6">She takes the call. The volume on her phone is loud enough for me to intermittently hear both sides of the conversation. Swift explains that she&#x2019;s driving to her house, but that she can&#x2019;t actually stay there because contractors are renovating almost every room. &#x201C;Have you ever seen the movie <em>The Money Pit</em>?&#x201D; asks Timberlake. She has not, so Timberlake provides a capsule review. He has a 4-month-old baby at home and is constantly tired, yet he can&#x2019;t fall sleep. He asks Swift for advice on sleeping. Swift tells the driver to pull over to the shoulder of the road, since she keeps losing reception as we drive through the canyon. The paparazzo in the gray car casually passes, having not-so-casually followed us for at least five miles.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.7"><a href="../gallery/taylor-swift-photos-gq">See Taylor Swift&#x2019;s Stunning <em>GQ</em> Photo Shoot</a></p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.8">The conversation lasts almost 15 minutes (which is a little weird, since I&#x2019;m just sitting there beside her, openly taking notes). &#x201C;You&#x2019;re never going to get old,&#x201D; Swift assures Timberlake. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s scientific fact. That&#x2019;s medical.&#x201D; Even her sarcasm is aspirational. Eventually JT tells her the reason he&#x2019;s calling is because he wants to perform the song &#x201C;Mirrors&#x201D; with her on the last night of her upcoming five-date stand at Staples Center. (<a href="taylor-swift-onstage-guest-ranking">Late in every concert, Swift brings a surprise guest onstage.</a>) She reacts to this news the way a teenage girl in Nebraska would react if suddenly informed that a paternity test had revealed Taylor Swift was her biological sister.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.9">When she ends the call, Swift looks at me and says, &#x201C;This is so crazy. This is so crazy.&#x201D; She repeats that phrase four times, each time with ascending volume.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.a">Now, inside my skull, I am thinking one thought: This is not remotely crazy. It actually seems like the opposite of crazy. Why <em>wouldn&#x2019;t</em> Justin Timberlake want to perform with the biggest entertainer in America, to an audience of 15,000 people who will lose their collective mind the moment he appears? I&#x2019;d have been much more surprised if he&#x2019;d called to turn her down. But then I remember that Swift is 25 years old, and that her entire ethos is based on experiencing (and interpreting) how her insane life would feel if she were exactly like the type of person who&#x2019;d buy a ticket to this particular concert. She has more perspective than I do. Every extension of who she is and how she works is (indeed) &#x201C;so crazy,&#x201D; and what&#x2019;s even crazier is my inability to recognize just how crazy it is.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.b">So Taylor Swift is right again.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>If you don&#x2019;t take Swift seriously,</strong> you don&#x2019;t take contemporary music seriously. With the (arguable) exceptions of <a href="../style/201408/the-4-step-kanye-west-guide-to-fashion">Kanye West</a> and <a href="../gallery/beyonce-cover-story-photos-gq-february-2013">Beyonc&#xE9; Knowles</a>, she is the most significant pop artist of the modern age. The scale of her commercial supremacy defies parallel&#x2014;she&#x2019;s sold 1 million albums in a week three times, during an era when most major artists are thrilled to move 500,000 albums in a year. If a record as comparatively dominant as <em>1989</em> had actually existed in the year 1989, it would have surpassed the sales of <em>Thriller.</em> There is no demographic she does not tap into, which is obviously rare. But what&#x2019;s even more atypical is how that ubiquity is critically received. Swift gets excellent reviews, particularly from the most significant arbiters of taste. (A 2011 <em>New Yorker</em> piece conceded that Swift&#x2019;s reviews are &#x201C;almost uniformly positive.&#x201D;) She has never gratuitously sexualized her image and seems pathologically averse to controversy. There&#x2019;s simply no antecedent for this kind of career: a cross-genre, youth-oriented, critically acclaimed colossus based entirely on the intuitive songwriting merits of a single female artist. It&#x2019;s as if mid-period Garth Brooks was also early Liz Phair, minus the hat and the swearing. As a phenomenon, it&#x2019;s absolutely new.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.e">And this, somewhat predictably, creates a new set of problems.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.f">Even within the most high-minded considerations of Swift&#x2019;s music, there is inevitably some analysis (or speculation) about her personal life. She&#x2019;s an utterly credible musician who is consumed as a tabloid personality. Very often (and not without justification), that binary is attributed to ingrained biases against female performers. But it&#x2019;s more complicated than that. Swift writes about her life so directly that the listener is forced to think about her persona in order to fully appreciate what she&#x2019;s doing creatively. This is her greatest power: an ability to combine her art and her life so profoundly that both spheres become more interesting to everyone, regardless of their emotional investment in either.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.g">Swift clearly knows this is happening. But she can&#x2019;t directly admit it, because it&#x2019;s the kind of thing that only works when it seems accidental. She&#x2019;s careful how she describes the process, because you don&#x2019;t become who she is by describing things carelessly.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>Even the most serious critics inevitably discuss the more tabloid aspects of your life. Is this valid? Does the fact that you write about yourself in such a confessional style require intelligent people to look at your music through that lens?</strong><br>I don&#x2019;t feel there is any injustice when people expand beyond my music and speculate on who certain songs might be about. I&#x2019;ve never named names, so I feel like I still have a sense of power over what people say&#x2014;even if that <em>isn&#x2019;t</em> true, and even if I don&#x2019;t have any power over what people say about me. The fact that I&#x2019;ve never confirmed who those songs are about makes me feel like there is still one card I&#x2019;m holding. So if you&#x2019;re going to look at your life and say, &#x201C;I get to play sold-out football stadiums all over the world. I get to call up my favorite artists and ask them to perform with me, and most of the time they say yes. I get to be on the cover of this magazine&#x201D;&#x2014;this is all because I write songs about my own life. So I would feel a little strange complaining about how it&#x2019;s covered.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>But I&#x2019;m not asking if it&#x2019;s fair or unfair, or if the downside is worth the upside. I&#x2019;m asking from an aesthetic perspective: Is thinking about your real life an essential part of appreciating your music? Could your music be enjoyed the same way in a vacuum, even if no one knew anything else about you?</strong><br>&#x201C;Shake It Off&#x201D; is one of my most successful songs, and that has nothing directly, intricately, pointedly personal in it. No one really says I stay out too late. I just thought it sounded good.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>Have you ever stopped yourself from writing a fictional lyric because you feared it would be incorrectly applied to your nonfictional life?</strong><br>No. Some of the things I write about on a song like &#x201C;Blank Space&#x201D; are satire. You take your creative license and create things that are larger than life. You can write things like <em>I get drunk on jealousy but you&#x2019;ll come back each time you leave, &#x2019;cause darling I&#x2019;m a nightmare dressed like a daydream.</em> That is not my approach to relationships. But is it cool to write the narrative of a girl who&#x2019;s crazy but seductive but glamorous but nuts but manipulative? That was the character I felt the media had written for me, and for a long time I felt hurt by it. I took it personally. But as time went by, I realized it was kind of hilarious.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.k">It&#x2019;s impossible for an artist to control how she is perceived. But an artist can anticipate those perceptions, which is almost as good. &#x201C;A nuanced sense of humor does not translate on a general scale,&#x201D; Swift says, &#x201C;and I knew that going in. I knew some people would hear &#x2018;Blank Space&#x2019; and say, <em>See, we were right about her.</em> And at that point, I just figure if you don&#x2019;t get the joke, you don&#x2019;t deserve to get the joke.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.l"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>There&#x2019;s a long tradition</strong> of musicians expressing (or pretending to express) a degree of disinterest in how they are metabolized by the culture. They claim to ignore their own reviews while feigning a lack of discernment about what their audience wants or expects, since these are things that cannot be manipulated. Swift is not like this. She has an extrinsic focus that informs her creative process. From her perspective, not tracking how people view your work feels stranger than the alternative.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.n">&#x201C;I went through a few years where I just never went online and never looked at blogs,&#x201D; she recalls. &#x201C;This was around 2013, when the only thing anyone wanted to write about me was about me and some guy. It was really damaging. You&#x2019;re thinking, &#x2018;Everybody goes on dates when they&#x2019;re 22. It&#x2019;s fine, right?&#x2019; Nope. Not when you&#x2019;re in this situation, and everything you do is blown out of proportion and expanded upon. And all of a sudden, there&#x2019;s an overriding opinion that doesn&#x2019;t accurately reflect how you actually live your life. So I didn&#x2019;t go online for a year and a half. I actually forgot my Instagram password. But now I check in and see what&#x2019;s happening. In 2015, that stuff does matter. Because if enough people say the same thing about me, it becomes fact in the general public&#x2019;s mind. So I monitor what people say about me, and if I see a theme, I know what that means. I&#x2019;ve had it happen twice before. In 2010, it was <em>She&#x2019;s too young to get all these awards. Look how annoying she is when she wins. Is she even good?</em> And then in 2013, it was <em>She just writes songs about guys to get revenge. She&#x2019;s boy-crazy. She&#x2019;s a problematic person.</em> It will probably be something else again this year.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.o"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&#x201C;To me, the safest thing I could do was take the biggest risk.

There is a perpetual sense that nothing about her career is accidental and that nothing about her life is unmediated. These are not unusual thoughts to have about young mainstream stars. But what&#x2019;s different with Swift is her autonomy. There is no Svengali directing her career; there is no stage mother pushing her toward the spotlight. She is in total control of her own constructed reality. If there was a machine that built humans out of positive millennial stereotypes, Swift would be its utopian creation.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.q">&#x201C;I used to watch <em>Behind the Music</em> every day,&#x201D; she says. (Her favorite episode was the one about the Bangles.) &#x201C;When other kids were watching normal shows, I&#x2019;d watch <em>Behind the Music.</em> And I would see these bands that were doing so well, and I&#x2019;d wonder what went wrong. I thought about this a lot. And what I established in my brain was that a lack of self-awareness was always the downfall. That was always the catalyst for the loss of relevance and the loss of ambition and the loss of great art. So self-awareness has been such a huge part of what I try to achieve on a daily basis. It&#x2019;s less about reputation management and strategy and vanity than it is about trying to desperately preserve self-awareness, since that seems to be the first thing to go out the door when people find success.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.r">The advantage of this self-focused fixation is clear. Swift is allowed to make whatever record she wants, based on the reasonable argument that she understands her specific space in the culture more deeply than anyone around her. The making of <em>1989</em> is a prime example: She claims everyone at her label (the Nashville-based Big Machine) tried to persuade her not to make a straightforward pop album. She recounts a litany of arguments with various label executives over every possible detail, from how much of her face would appear on the cover to how co-writer Max Martin would be credited in the liner notes.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.s">As far as I can tell, Swift won every one of these debates.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.t">&#x201C;Even calling this record <em>1989</em> was a risk,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;I had so many intense conversations where my label really tried to step in. I could tell they&#x2019;d all gotten together and decided, &#x2018;We gotta talk some sense into her. She&#x2019;s had an established, astronomically successful career in country music. To shake that up would be the biggest mistake she ever makes.&#x2019; But to me, the safest thing I could do was take the biggest risk. I know how to write a song. I&#x2019;m not confident about a lot of other aspects of my life, but I know how to write a song. I&#x2019;d read a review of [2012&#x2019;s] <em>Red</em> that said it wasn&#x2019;t sonically cohesive. So that was what I wanted on <em>1989:</em> an umbrella that would go over all of these songs, so that they all belonged on the same album. But then I&#x2019;d go into the label office, and they were like, &#x2018;Can we talk about putting a fiddle and a steel-guitar solo on &#x2018;Shake It Off&#x2019; to service country radio?&#x2019; I was trying to make the most honest record I could possibly make, and they were kind of asking me to be a little disingenuous about it: &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s capitalize on both markets.&#x2019; No, let&#x2019;s not. Let&#x2019;s choose a lane.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.u"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>Like almost all famous people,</strong> Swift has two ways of speaking. The first is the way she talks when she&#x2019;s actively shaping the interview&#x2014;optimistic, animated, and seemingly rehearsed (even when that&#x2019;s impossible). The second is the way she talks when she cares less about the way the words are presented and more about the message itself (chin slightly down, brow slightly furrowed, timbre slightly deeper). The first way is how she talks when she&#x2019;s on television; the second is unequivocal and less animatronic. But she oscillates between the two styles fluidly, because either <em>(a)</em> this dissonance is less intentional than it appears or <em>(b)</em> she can tell I&#x2019;m considerably more interested in anything delivered in the second style.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.w"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&#x201C;Am I shooting from the hip?&#x201D; she asks rhetorically. &#x201C;Would any of

She really, really hates the word <em>calculating.</em> She despises how it has become tethered to her iconography and believes the person I met has been the singular voice regurgitating this categorization. As she explains these things, her speech does not oscillate from the second mode.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.y">&#x201C;Am I shooting from the hip?&#x201D; she asks rhetorically. &#x201C;Would any of this have happened if I was? In that sense, I do think about things before they happen. But here was someone taking a positive thing&#x2014;the fact that I think about things and that I care about my work&#x2014;and trying to make that into an insinuation about my personal life. Highly offensive. You can be accidentally successful for three or four years. Accidents happen. But careers take hard work.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.z"><a href="../gallery/taylor-swift-photos-gq">See Taylor Swift&#x2019;s Stunning <em>GQ</em> Photo Shoot</a></p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.10">Here we see Swift&#x2019;s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated. Because Swift&#x2019;s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it&#x2019;s assumed that her social life is no less premeditated. This even applies to casual, non-romantic relationships. Over the past three years, Swift has built a volunteer army of high-profile friends, many of whom appear in her videos and serve as special guests at her concerts. In almost any other circumstance, this would be seen as a likable trait; Leonardo DiCaprio behaved similarly in the &#x2019;90s, and everyone thought it was awesome. But it&#x2019;s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice League (&#x201C;the ectomorph model,&#x201D; &#x201C;the inventive indie artist,&#x201D; &#x201C;the informed third-wave feminist,&#x201D; etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is genuinely obsessed with these attachments. &#x201C;I honestly think my lack of female friendships in high school and middle school is why my female friendships are so important now,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Because I always wanted them. It was just hard for me to have friends.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.11">Popular people often claim they were once unpopular, so I ask Swift for a specific example. She tells a story about middle school, when she called several of her peers on the phone and asked if they wanted to go shopping. Every girl had a different excuse for why she couldn&#x2019;t go. Eventually, Swift&#x2019;s mother agreed to take her to the local mall. When they arrived, Swift saw all of the girls she had called on the phone, goofing around in Victoria&#x2019;s Secret. &#x201C;I just remember my mom looking at me and saying, <em>We&#x2019;re going to King of Prussia Mall.</em> Which is the big, big mall in Pennsylvania, 45 minutes away. So we left and went to the better mall. My mom let me escape from certain things that were too painful to deal with. And we talked about it the whole ride there, and we had a good time shopping.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.12">This incident appears to be the genesis for a verse in her 2008 song &#x201C;The Best Day,&#x201D; a connection she doesn&#x2019;t note when she tells me the story. A cynical person could read something into this anecdote and turn it into a metaphor about capitalism or parenting or creativity or Pennsylvania. But in the framework of our conversation, it did not seem metaphoric of anything. It just seemed like a (very real) memory that might be more internally motivating than any simplistic desire for money or power.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.13">So is it unfair to categorize Swift as <em>calculating?</em> Maybe, and particularly if you view that term as exclusively pejorative. But calling her <em>guileless</em> would be even crazier. Swift views her lyrics as the most important part of her art (&#x201C;The lyrics are what I want you to focus on,&#x201D; she asserts), so we spend some time parsing specific passages from specific songs. Here is how she dissects the conjecture over &#x201C;Bad Blood,&#x201D; a single universally assumed to be about <a href="katy-perry-cover-story-february-2014">Katy Perry</a>.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.14"><strong>You never say who your songs are about, but you concede that if enough people believe something, it essentially becomes fact. So by not saying who you&#x2019;re writing about, aren&#x2019;t you allowing public consensus to dictate the meaning of your work? If everyone assumes that &#x201C;Bad Blood&#x201D; is about a specific person, aren&#x2019;t you allowing the culture to create a fact about your life?</strong><br>You&#x2019;re in a <em>Rolling Stone</em> interview, and the writer says, &#x201C;Who is that song about? That sounds like a really intense moment from your life.&#x201D; And you sit there, and you know you&#x2019;re on good terms with your ex-boyfriend, and you don&#x2019;t want him&#x2014;or his family&#x2014;to think you&#x2019;re firing shots at him. So you say, &#x201C;That was about losing a friend.&#x201D; And that&#x2019;s basically all you say. But then people cryptically tweet about what you meant. I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that. I knew the song would be assigned to a person, and the easiest mark was someone who I didn&#x2019;t want to be labeled with this song. It was not a song about heartbreak. It was about the loss of friendship.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>But nobody thinks that song is about a guy.</strong><br><em>But they would have.</em> So I don&#x2019;t necessarily care who people think it&#x2019;s about. I just needed to divert them away from the easiest target. Listen to the song. It doesn&#x2019;t point to any one person or any one situation. But if you&#x2019;d listened to my previous four albums, you would think this was about a guy who broke my heart. And nothing could be further from the truth. It was important to show that losing friendships can be just as damaging to a person as losing a romantic relationship.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.16">Now, there are more than a few molecules of bullshit in this response. When Swift says, &#x201C;And that&#x2019;s basically all you say,&#x201D; she&#x2019;s neglecting to mention that she also told the reporter that the disharmony stemmed from a business conflict, and that the individual in question tried to sabotage an arena tour by hiring away some of her employees. These details dramatically reduce the pool of potential candidates. Yet consider the strategy&#x2019;s larger brilliance: In order to abort the possibility of a rumor she did not want, she propagated the existence of a different rumor that offered the added value of making the song more interesting.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.17">Swift can manufacture the kind of mythology that used to happen to Carly Simon by accident.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.18"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.19"><strong>Speaking of accidents,</strong> here&#x2019;s some breaking news: They happen to Taylor Swift, too. She believes the most consequential accident of her professional life was when Kanye West famously stormed the stage during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. I&#x2019;m surprised when she brings this up unprompted, because she has barely addressed the incident in five years, aside from the (comically undisguised) song &#x201C;Innocent.&#x201D; But fences have been mended and feelings have been felt. At this summer&#x2019;s VMAs, Swift warmly presented West with the Video Vanguard trophy.

When West first jumped onstage, Swift halfway assumed he was about to make a special presentation, honoring her for being the first country artist to ever win a VMA. She truly had no idea what was transpiring. &#x201C;When the crowd started booing, I thought they were booing because they also believed I didn&#x2019;t deserve the award. That&#x2019;s where the hurt came from. I went backstage and cried, and then I had to stop crying and perform five minutes later. I just told myself I had to perform, and I tried to convince myself that maybe this wasn&#x2019;t that big of a deal. But that was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career. And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other&#x2014;that&#x2019;s one of my <em>favorite</em> things that has happened in my career.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.1c">Swift analyzes her friendships so often that I eventually ask what seems like an obvious question: Does she ever feel lonely? She responds by literally talking about <em>Friends.</em> &#x201C;I&#x2019;m around people so much,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Massive amounts of people. I do a meet-and-greet every night on the tour, and it&#x2019;s 150 people. Before that, it&#x2019;s a radio meet-and-greet with 40 people. After the show, it&#x2019;s 30 or 40 more people. So then when I go home and turn on the TV, and I&#x2019;ve got Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel and Phoebe and Joey on a <em>Friends</em> marathon, I don&#x2019;t feel lonely. I&#x2019;ve just been onstage for two hours, talking to 60,000 people about my feelings. That&#x2019;s so much social stimulation. When I get home, there is not one part of me that wishes I was around other people.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.1d">This is understandable. Still, I note something any musician obsessed with self-awareness would undoubtedly recognize: In the retrospective context of a hypothetical <em>Behind the Music</em> episode, this anecdote would be framed as depressing. It would paint the portrait of a super-famous entertainer spending her day emoting to thousands of strangers, only to return home to an empty house and the one-way company of two-dimensional characters.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.1e">Does she not see the irony?</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.1f">Oh, she sees it. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s real.</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.1g">&#x201C;There is such a thing as having enough,&#x201D; she says in her non-TV voice. &#x201C;You might think a meet-and-greet with 150 people sounds sad, because maybe you think I&#x2019;m forced to do it. But you would be surprised. A meaningful conversation doesn&#x2019;t mean that conversation has to last an hour. A meet-and-greet might sound weird to someone who&#x2019;s never done one, but after ten years, you learn to appreciate happiness when it happens, and that happiness is rare and fleeting, and that you&#x2019;re not entitled to it. You know, during the first few years of your career, the only thing anyone says to you is &#x2018;Enjoy this. Just enjoy this.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s all they ever tell you. And I finally know how to do that.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".2bnlc9evi80.1.1.0.0.4.1h">Taylor Swift is 25.
