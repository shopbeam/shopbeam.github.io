  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AIn the summertime, Donald Sutherland and his wife and their dog live in a large Victorian-ish house ninety minutes east of Montreal. It\u0027s Northwoods country, dense with birch and pine. Sutherland\u0027s house looks out on a large lake, and on the far side there is a stone abbey where monks pray and make cheese. Come evening, if the wind blows the right way across the lake, Sutherland can hear their chants.\u000A\u000AHe is almost 80 now and is at a curious stage in his illustrious career. There is probably a large swath of people under 25 that know him solely as the spooky white-bearded guy in the Hunger Games franchise (or maybe as the father of that actor on 24). This is the same generation that almost certainly doesn\u0027t know about the transformative range of his work, from Kelly\u0027s Heroes to Ordinary People to Fellini\u0027s Casanova to Klute, the film that finally made him a leading man at 35—and stoked his romance with Jane Fonda.\u000A\u000AWhen Sutherland meets me on the front porch, he\u0027s dressed in a jacket and pants. He\u0027s a tall man: six feet two. In person, his features—the crystal blue eyes, the white-white hair, the cheekbones—are even more striking than you\u0027d expect. He tells me the house has become an ancestral home for his kids and grandkids. (Sutherland himself was born farther east, in St. John, New Brunswick.) He leads me to a large room off his study—a room crammed with papers and books. The room is professorial, and so is he—a bit like the aged version of his character from Animal House.\u000A\u000AHow do you deal with rejection? As an actor, you get 10 percent of the roles—\u000A\u000A Not very well, right? You know, after Ordinary People, I couldn\u0027t get an audition for a year. There was one film that I wanted. Something about dancing—\u000A\u000AFootloose? Flashdance?\u000A\u000A I think it was Flashdance? And the producer said to Ronny [his then agent, Ron Meyer], \u0022You would have a better chance getting the part than he would.\u0022\u000A\u000AMy first offer ever for a film was in 1962. I auditioned for the producer, the writer, the director. And I came home and said to my first wife, \u0022I thought it went okay.\u0022 You never want to say you did well before you know anything. The next morning they were all on the phone saying how wonderful the audition had been. And then the producer said, \u0022We loved you so much, we wanted to explain why we weren\u0027t casting you. We\u0027ve always thought of this as a guy-next-door sort of character, and we don\u0027t think you look like you\u0027ve ever lived next door to anybody.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat attracted you to The Hunger Games?\u000A\u000A Nobody asked me to do it. I wasn\u0027t offered it. I like to read scripts, and it captured my passion. I wrote them a letter. The role of the president had maybe a line in the script. Maybe two. Didn\u0027t make any difference. I thought it was an incredibly important film, and I wanted to be a part of it. I thought it could wake up an electorate that had been dormant since the \u002770s. I hadn\u0027t read the books. To be truthful, I was unaware of them. But they showed my letter to the director, Gary Ross, and he thought it\u0027d be a good idea if I did it. He wrote those wonderfully poetic scenes in the rose garden, and they formed the mind and wit of Coriolanus Snow.\u000A\u000ADo you think about your own mortality?\u000A\u000A Sure.... I bought Final Exit, Derek Humphry\u0027s book on the best way to kill yourself. I mean, I would be—I just really don\u0027t want to leave her. [gestures toward kitchen and his wife, Francine] And I for sure don\u0027t want her to be dead. The word disturbs me. But I\u0027m getting more accustomed to the idea of being dead. Because I have my mother, my father, my brother, and my sister in bos here—they\u0027re in the other room—and we have to put them in the ground. So that\u0027s been a part of our occupation the past month. I like having them here, but my wife would like them in a proper place.\u000A\u000ABut I don\u0027t want to give up living, because I enjoy it so much, and I love working—I don\u0027t expect I\u0027ll ever have to stop. But Alzheimer\u0027s or something like that would render me pretty useless. Your grandmother had dementia, yes?\u000A\u000AHow did you know?\u000A\u000A I started reading your book. [I wrote a memoir about the mystery surrounding the death of my father.] The line of your grandmother\u0027s about \u0022perseverance is the great trait.\u0022 Wow.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve said that since childhood you\u0027ve been death-obsessed.\u000A\u000A Well, I kind of gave that obsession up—but I was sick all the time. I had polio.\u000A\u000AWhere did that obsession come from?\u000A\u000A I was somewhere between 6 and 10. I was obsessed with not knowing what happened after you were dead. And I sat or kneeled for a whole day with my head against the wall, trying to figure it out. But I couldn\u0027t, and I just said, \u0022Okay.\u0022 And then it was nothingness. Like Woody Allen says, \u0022I\u0027m taking a change of underwear just in case.\u0022 So, you know, I have no God.\u000A\u000ADid your father\u0027s death hit you hard?\u000A\u000A My father\u0027s death? My son, two nights ago, we were talking about my mother, who I loved dearly. She was really subject to my father—possibly the most self-centered individual I\u0027ve ever met. And when my mother died, at her funeral—my son would have been about 8—I was by the coffin. I was bereft, even though she had been in a coma for weeks. And my father, I found out two nights ago, was telling awful jokes to my son. At the funeral. It\u0027s a moment of such anguish for my son.\u000A\u000AThat must have felt—\u000A\u000A Well, I have to be truthful. After my mother\u0027s funeral—because it had been so difficult with my father—I left. And I didn\u0027t get back to see him for two or three months. I was on my way back to see him—I was in Montreal, and I stayed over because the Expos were playing. And when I got back to my flat, the telephone rang and it was Francine, and—this is a hard story to tell—she said, \u0022Your father is dead. Now you\u0027re an orphan. Now I have you all to myself, alone.\u0022 Which was perfect. Perfect.\u000A\u000AAnd I called the woman who had been taking care of him and said, \u0022Did he say anything?\u0022 She said, \u0022Yes. He said, \u0027It was better when the children were young.\u0027 \u0022 And I said, \u0022Thanks a lot for that—that was really helpful.\u0022 Anyway. Hard—he was hard to deal with. So. Death.\u000A\u000AHe just never wanted a relationship?\u000A\u000A I\u0027ve still never figured it out. I think he was in some way disappointed in me.\u000A\u000AIt was never good enough?\u000A\u000A No, never good enough. Never good enough. Mine is a wound of failure. Of inability to make him happy.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022It was better when the children were young.\u0022 That sounds like: \u0022That\u0027s when I was the king and I could control—\u0022\u000A\u000A Exactly.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not that you failed—it\u0027s that you succeeded. You surpassed him, but he could not take joy in that.\u000A\u000A The problem is, he was my father and I wanted to please him. But yes, the minute I found success—pretty much after MASH was released, he didn\u0027t do anything but complain about me.\u000A\u000AI can\u0027t help but associate everything you say with Ordinary People and your vulnerability in that character.\u000A\u000A Oh, sure. Absolutely. Even now, just sitting here, it\u0027s not that easy to deal with, so I haven\u0027t resolved anything.\u000A\u000AWhat qualities of your mother\u0027s do you have?\u000A\u000A Her nose! [laughs] She was brutally honest. When I was 15 or 16, I said, \u0022Mother, am I good-looking?\u0022 And she went, \u0022Donald, your face has character.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAfter we\u0027ve spoken for an hour, Sutherland says it\u0027s time for lunch. We walk to the deck and sit beneath a billowing canopy. He puts steaks on the grill and opens a bottle of white Burgundy.\u000A\u000AWould you say you\u0027re a loner?\u000A\u000A No, I have my wife. We\u0027ve been together for forty-two years.\u000A\u000AI mean, are you solitary by nature?\u000A\u000A No, I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027m quite gregarious. I tell a lot of jokes. But I don\u0027t go into bars. [long pause] It\u0027s interesting, your question. My brother and I, we weren\u0027t close. But he had a stroke when he was 38, maybe—he lost control of his left arm and left leg, and I think a good part of his brain. And he was a born-again Christian. I wouldn\u0027t give him money, because he would just give it to the church, but I paid all of his bills. And then he had another stroke a couple of years ago and was in palliative care. And they phoned me to say that he had not regained consciousness. I said, \u0022I\u0027m in the middle of working, and I can\u0027t get down there. Can you keep me abreast?\u0022 And then he died. They cremated him and sent his ashes here, in that box I have to take care of. Two weeks afterwards, I received a phone call from a grief counselor at the palliative-care center. She said, \u0022I want to talk to you about dealing with the grief.\u0022 And I said, \u0022I don\u0027t have any grief. We were never very close.\u0022 She said, \u0022You should write him a letter,\u0022 and I said, \u0022What\u0027s the point? He\u0027s dead.\u0022 She said, \u0022Write about the things that—\u0022 And suddenly I started to bawl. And I said, \u0022Thank you very much.\u0022 I went to my computer and started to write him a letter. There are forty pages, and it\u0027s not even nearly finished.\u000A\u000AWho is your best friend?\u000A\u000A Ron Meyer.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s his best trait?\u000A\u000A Perseverance? [We both laugh.] I guess, in a sense, perseverance, yeah, because he has carried with me... I once said to him that I was depressed and contemplating suicide. And he said, \u0022Oh, please don\u0027t do that.\u0022 I said, \u0022Why?\u0022 He said, \u0022Because if you did, then I would try to make love to your wife.\u0022 At that moment, all thoughts of suicide disappeared. Gone. [laughs] Really, though, I would never have done it. I was just being romantic and self-indulgent. Ron said what he said to do just what it did: wake up my self-indulgent self.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWere you shocked when you heard about Robin Williams?\u000A\u000A No. I was shocked by the way he did it, because, you know—I mean, look at his face in those recent interviews. I remember John Belushi. We shared a doctor, and John was coming out of the office as I was going in—snot was hanging six feet out of his nose, and I said to my doctor, \u0022He\u0027s going to die.\u0022 And my doctor says, \u0022Yes. I\u0027ve tried to get him to stop, and John just says, \u0027I give people pleasure, why can\u0027t I have pleasure?\u0027 \u0022 But no, I wasn\u0027t surprised. I was crushed, but not surprised. Depression is an extraordinary thing. It was different from Philip [Seymour Hoffman]. Philip, that was just... I can\u0027t bring myself to actually speak about it.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABut in some ways, Philip was, I mean, suicide comes in different—\u000A\u000A Yeah, exactly. Precisely.\u000A\u000ATell me about yourself as a father.\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t think I\u0027m a good father. [calls out] Francine! She\u0027s a wonderful mother.\u000A\u000ABut I don\u0027t believe that about you.\u000A\u000A I\u0027m not a bad father, but I\u0027m not a terribly good father. Francine! Am I a good father?\u000A\u000AFrancine Racette, the French-Canadian actress who is the mother of Sutherland\u0027s three youngest children, emerges from the kitchen.\u000A\u000AFrancine: How would I know? I\u0027m not your child. Why don\u0027t you ask me, \u0022Am I a good husband?\u0022 [laughs] Listen, he is a good father, because everybody knows—\u000A\u000ADS: My children love me. [to Francine] You know something, darling?\u000A\u000AFrancine: Quoi?\u000A\u000ADS: I\u0027ve never had this much food at lunch in my life. [tastes wine; pauses] Brodsky. Joseph Brodsky—\u000A\u000AI went to his grave in Venice.\u000A\u000A DS: Fuck! He\u0027s my hero. That line he said, \u0022Try to stay passionate, leave your cool to constellations. Passion, above all, is a remedy against boredom.\u0022 If you want my mantra, that\u0027s it.... As an actor, you risk yourself every time you start. For me, it\u0027s quite frightening. So much so that it makes me physically sick before I begin.\u000A\u000AAre there some mornings you don\u0027t want to get out of bed?\u000A\u000A Francine: Tell him about making the film with Marlon Brando. A Dry White Season.\u000A\u000ADS: I was in the shower at four in the morning, and his producer phoned and said, \u0022We\u0027re not shooting today. Marlon doesn\u0027t think he\u0027s ready.\u0022 I said, \u0022We\u0027re closing down production for the day because Marlon doesn\u0027t think he\u0027s ready?\u0022 He said, \u0022Yes.\u0022 I said, \u0022Tell Marlon I admire him. Because if I had that power, I would never go to work.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut no, I just—I love my job. I love doing it. It\u0027s a passionate endeavor. And sometimes you can get close to something that you believe is the truth. The truth of something. Not all the time, but sometimes.\u000A\u000AWhen you were doing roles that were provocative, such as Don\u0027t Look Now...\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t think my parents ever saw that.\u000A\u000AFilming those scenes with Julie Christie, you didn\u0027t think, \u0022What will they think?\u0022\u000A\u000A No. But it\u0027s curious that you ask. Because I think of people doing sex films and think, Don\u0027t they think of their parents?\u000A\u000ASo when you\u0027re creating, you never see your parents over your shoulder?\u000A\u000A No. I don\u0027t see them at all, ever. Never. It\u0027s completely and utterly disassociated from that. I never see anybody.\u000A\u000ALet\u0027s go back to what you said about your father and his last words. If you could script your last words—\u000A\u000A You know what John Barrymore\u0027s last words were? He was in a coma, and they had a death watch on him.\u000A\u000AHe was an alcoholic.\u000A\u000A Severe. And he came to consciousness and went [makes crazy gargling noises]. And the guy sitting beside him said, \u0022What did you say, John?\u0022 And he said, \u0022You heard me, you son of a bitch.\u0022 And died.\u000A\u000AHow do you navigate disappointment?\u000A\u000A I think you just kind of idle and hope that it drifts away. I haven\u0027t been very good about dealing with disappointment. I suffer it, and then when that suffering becomes a kind of predation, then it\u0027s gone. Because the disappointment is not always realistic. It too is very subjective, and it has to do with hopes that weren\u0027t realistic.\u000A\u000AYou know, for example, with Fellini—it\u0027s a huge regret. Working with him [on Casanova], it was so sensual. I\u0027ve said it so many times—I was his concubine. He would tell me what to do, and I would know instantly how to do it. For me it was wonderful. He said he felt it was the best film he had ever made—the Italian version, not the English version—and afterwards, after I had left that screening, I didn\u0027t see him again, except in very formal circumstances. It was as if I had left a lover and didn\u0027t know how to deal with it—I didn\u0027t know how to deal with him if I wasn\u0027t working for him, and that was incredibly disappointing.\u000A\u000AI\u0027m going to throw out a theory: There\u0027s part of you that keeps saying no to authority figures.\u000A\u000A Authoritarian figures. There\u0027s a difference.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s the difference between directors and your dad? The way you push them away.\u000A\u000A There\u0027s no difference.\u000A\u000AYou can joke that you\u0027re a concubine to Fellini, but one could say you found in Fellini someone who loved you, cared for you, nurtured you...\u000A\u000A Exactly, exactly, exactly! Which is why I couldn\u0027t have a fucking relationship with him afterwards.\u000A\u000ABecause you were afraid of it.\u000A\u000A God! And that breaks my heart. For me to destroy that. Ohhhhh. Shit.\u000A\u000AYou didn\u0027t destroy anything! You did a fantastic movie with one of the greatest directors of the twentieth century. Isn\u0027t that enough?\u000A\u000A [long pause] The first five weeks of the shoot were the worst of my life, and then something happened. I don\u0027t know what. But suddenly we were [in sync]. He\u0027d say, \u0022We need to shoot another scene,\u0022 and he\u0027d hand me two pages of dialogue. I\u0027d say, \u0022When do you want to shoot?\u0022 And he\u0027d say, \u0022Now.\u0022 I\u0027d say, \u0022Okay.\u0022 I\u0027d look at it, and I would know it. I would know it.\u000A\u000ASo hold on to that. Working with Fellini, it\u0027s like getting painted by El Greco. Now, tell me who inspires you.\u000A\u000A [another long pause] When people ask me where I live, I say, \u0022I live with my wife.\u0022 I don\u0027t know whether I live in Paris, New York, or Miami. I live with my wife. My inspiration, my judgment, it comes from my wife. She has...truth. And it\u0027s humbling. And so it\u0027s necessary that whatever ertions I make meet with her...not necessarily her approval, but at least her acceptance. Would you say that\u0027s true? [looks to Francine] Oh, I so love you. God! [back to me] Come, let\u0027s look at the garden.\u000A\u000AWe walk through the garden Francine has planted and, after a bit more time, bid farewell. A week later, I get an e-mail from Sutherland saying he\u0027s finished my book and that it \u0022is inside me, running around like crazy.\u0022 A few days after that, he sends me a letter pointing out similarities that struck him, images that triggered memories. He writes, in part:\u000A\u000AYour grandmother saying that she should go out trick-or-treating and \u0022scare \u0027em all good.\u0022\u000A\u000A I did that. I\u0027d broken my leg. It was in a cast. But we always went out with my granddaughter, Kiefer\u0027s daughter, on Halloween, so away we went into the inner reaches of Santa Monica. But they got tired of pushing my wheelchair, so they stopped and they put me on the lawn. I was wearing a black jacket, black pants, my stiffened right leg stuck out straight on the wheelchair support. Francine took off her panty hose and put them over my head. She put a bowl of candies on my lap and they all went into the house, sat at the windows and waited. The sidewalk was a good fifteen feet away. I didn\u0027t move a muscle. People walked by. Children pleaded for candies in the bowl. Mothers cautioned. Some kids dared. They got to the bowl. Reached in. And I grabbed their arm. The child let out a huge scream and I let go. They peed and wept as they ran to their mothers, but I guarantee those kids will remember it with pleasure forever.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AYour mother playing solitaire at the kitchen table.\u000A\u000A My mother, too. She once told me she could go to Las Vegas and make a lot of money. But I don\u0027t think she ever played solitaire, just blackjack at the Sahara. My father played roulette. The wheel would turn. The black ball would drop and he\u0027d lose. Always. Until he got Parkinson\u0027s. Then he\u0027d hold a stack [of chips] in the palm of his hand and try to lay them down one at a time, his hand would go squirrelly, the chips would spray every which way, and he\u0027d win.\u000A\u000AA blonde with a ponytail? \u0022Come over, baby\u0022? A naked silhouette in a phosphorescent light?\u000A\u000A I was with Jane Fonda at the Chelsea Hotel in 1970, maybe \u002771. It was a room with a big bed and, to the right, four or five stairs to a landing that led to the bathroom. There was a little oval window on the landing and there was a streetlight shining through that window though it seemed more like moonlight so maybe it was the moon, I like to think it was the moon. I was lying on my back on the bed when Jane came out of the bathroom. She, too, was naked, and when the moonlight caught her perfect breasts I stopped breathing. Everything stopped. And then it started again. Now, when I see it in my memory, I stopped breathing again.\u000A\u000AMichael Hainey (@michaelhainey)  is GQ\u0027s deputy editor and the author of After Visiting Friends: A Son\u0027s Story.",

Sutherland is that he has always gratefully, gleefully taken roles of all sizes and shapes, from the pot-smoking professor in Animal House to the evil President Snow in the <em>Hunger Games</em>

As he prepares to reprise that character this month, the 79-year-old legend invites Michael Hainey to his Canadian lake house, where he grills steaks, uncorks a few bottles, and pulls no punches about his truly epic Hollywood life</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.0"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c92be52bc4b477a9d7c5/master/w_806/entertainment-2014-11-donald-sutherland-donald-sutherland-gq-magazine-november-2014-01.jpg" alt="entertainment-2014-11-donald-sutherland-donald-sutherland-gq-magazine-november-2014-01.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdonald-sutherland-hunger-games&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-donald-sutherland-donald-sutherland-gq-magazine-november-2014-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdonald-sutherland-hunger-games&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-donald-sutherland-donald-sutherland-gq-magazine-november-2014-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdonald-sutherland-hunger-games&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c92be52bc4b477a9d7c5%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-donald-sutherland-donald-sutherland-gq-magazine-november-2014-01.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-donald-sutherland-donald-sutherland-gq-magazine-november-2014-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdonald-sutherland-hunger-games&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c92be52bc4b477a9d7c5%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-donald-sutherland-donald-sutherland-gq-magazine-november-2014-01.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-donald-sutherland-donald-sutherland-gq-magazine-november-2014-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.1">In the summertime, Donald Sutherland and his wife and their dog live in a large Victorian-ish house ninety minutes east of Montreal. It&#x2019;s Northwoods country, dense with birch and pine. Sutherland&#x2019;s house looks out on a large lake, and on the far side there is a stone abbey where monks pray and make cheese. Come evening, if the wind blows the right way across the lake, Sutherland can hear their chants.</p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.2">He is almost 80 now and is at a curious stage in his illustrious career. There is probably a large swath of people under 25 that know him solely as the spooky white-bearded guy in the <em>Hunger Games</em> franchise (or maybe as the father of that actor on <em>24</em>). This is the same generation that almost certainly <em>doesn&#x2019;t</em> know about the transformative range of his work, from <em>Kelly&#x2019;s Heroes</em> to <em>Ordinary People</em> to <em>Fellini&#x2019;s Casanova</em> to <em>Klute,</em> the film that finally made him a leading man at 35&#x2014;and stoked his romance with Jane Fonda.</p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.3">When Sutherland meets me on the front porch, he&#x2019;s dressed in a jacket and pants. He&#x2019;s a tall man: six feet two. In person, his features&#x2014;the crystal blue eyes, the white-white hair, the cheekbones&#x2014;are even more striking than you&#x2019;d expect. He tells me the house has become an ancestral home for his kids and grandkids. (Sutherland himself was born farther east, in St. John, New Brunswick.) He leads me to a large room off his study&#x2014;a room crammed with papers and books. The room is professorial, and so is he&#x2014;a bit like the aged version of his character from <em>Animal House</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>How do you deal with rejection? As an actor, you get 10 percent of the roles&#x2014;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.6"> Not very well, right? You know, after <em>Ordinary People,</em> I couldn&#x2019;t get an audition for a year. There was one film that I wanted. Something about dancing&#x2014;</p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong><em>Footloose</em>? <em>Flashdance</em>?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.8"> I think it was <em>Flashdance</em>? And the producer said to Ronny [his then agent, Ron Meyer], &quot;<em>You</em> would have a better chance getting the part than he would.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.9">My first offer ever for a film was in 1962. I auditioned for the producer, the writer, the director. And I came home and said to my first wife, &quot;I thought it went okay.&quot; You never want to say you did well before you know anything. The next morning they were all on the phone saying how wonderful the audition had been. And then the producer said, &quot;We loved you so much, we wanted to explain why we weren&#x2019;t casting you. We&#x2019;ve always thought of this as a guy-next-door sort of character, and we don&#x2019;t think you look like you&#x2019;ve ever lived next door to anybody.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>What attracted you to <em>The Hunger Games</em>?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.b"> Nobody asked me to do it. I wasn&#x2019;t offered it. I like to read scripts, and it captured my passion. I wrote them a letter. The role of the president had maybe a line in the script. Maybe two. Didn&#x2019;t make any difference. I thought it was an incredibly important film, and I wanted to be a part of it. I thought it could wake up an electorate that had been dormant since the &#x2019;70s. I hadn&#x2019;t read the books. To be truthful, I was unaware of them. But they showed my letter to the director, Gary Ross, and he thought it&#x2019;d be a good idea if I did it. He wrote those wonderfully poetic scenes in the rose garden, and they formed the mind and wit of Coriolanus Snow.</p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Do you think about your own mortality?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Sure.... I bought <em>Final Exit,</em> Derek Humphry&#x2019;s book on the best way to kill yourself. I mean, I would be&#x2014;I just really don&#x2019;t want to leave her. <em>[gestures toward kitchen and his wife, Francine]</em> And I for sure don&#x2019;t want <em>her</em> to be dead. The word disturbs me. But I&#x2019;m getting more accustomed to the <em>idea</em> of being dead. Because I have my mother, my father, my brother, and my sister in bos here&#x2014;they&#x2019;re in the other room&#x2014;and we have to put them in the ground. So that&#x2019;s been a part of our occupation the past month. I like having them here, but my wife would like them in a proper place.</p><p data-reactid=".1am2li44etc.1.1.0.0.4.e">But I don&#x2019;t want to give up living, because I enjoy it so much, and I love working&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t expect I&#x2019;ll ever have to stop.

I was wearing a black jacket, black pants, my stiffened right leg stuck out straight on the wheelchair support. Francine took off her panty hose and put them over my head. She put a bowl of candies on my lap and they all went into the house, sat at the windows and waited. The sidewalk was a good fifteen feet away. I didn&#x2019;t move a muscle. People walked by. Children pleaded for candies in the bowl. Mothers cautioned. Some kids dared. They got to the bowl. Reached in. And I grabbed their arm. The child let out a huge scream and I let go.

There was a little oval window on the landing and there was a streetlight shining through that window though it seemed more like moonlight so maybe it was the moon, I like to think it was the moon. I was lying on my back on the bed when Jane came out of the bathroom. She, too, was naked, and when the moonlight caught her perfect breasts I stopped breathing. Everything stopped.
