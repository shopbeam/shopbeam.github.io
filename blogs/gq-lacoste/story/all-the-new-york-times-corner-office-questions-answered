  	    "articleBody": "Is there a right way to get ahead?! Welcome to Raise Your Game—our week of examining success at work, whether you\u0027re Patrick Bateman, an on-the-job stoner, or just a guy who wants to see a shit-ton of zeros on his paycheck.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOn the ides of March 2009—a holiday celebrating ambition at any cost—the New York Times launched \u0022a new Sunday Business feature\u0022 called Corner Office, to provide \u0022highlights from conversations about leadership and management.\u0022 It began with a headline: \u0022Can You Pass a C.E.O. Test?\u0022 Since that moment, Corner Office has been populating its headlines with a parade of perpetually vague questions. \u000A\u000AThere is something about the authority of this column that begs an immediate response. One sits up straight, like it\u0027s a job interview and says, I believe I can pass the C.E.O. test, if given the opportunity to pass the C.E.O. test, I would be an excellent candidate for consideration to pass the C.E.O. test. \u000A\u000AWith that attitude, here are all my answers to every question asked, posed, and put forth by Corner Office column headlines since their inception. There are 54. \u000A\u000AMarch 15, 2009: Can You Pass a C.E.O. Test?Right out the gate, New York Times! I\u0027m not put off by your question style at all. I feel that this whole endeavor will test whether or not I can pass the proverbial C.E.O. test, that I certainly knew existed before it was mentioned to me just now. \u000A\u000AJune 14, 2009:  Would You Be a Solvent, or the Glue?According to the wisdom of the playground, one usually selects to be rubber rather than glue. Solvent, a fun new element which I could certainly define but won\u0027t, seems suitable for a schoolyard one-upmanship. I\u0027ll be a solvent. \u000A\u000AJuly 5, 2009: Charisma? To Her, It\u0027s OverratedI would love some of that, thank you. Oh, just heard you finish that thought. Yeah, totally, mark that thing as overrated. Don\u0027t touch the stuff, myself. \u000A\u000AAugust 16, 2009: You Want Insights? Go to the Front LinesI do want insights; that\u0027s why I\u0027m here, reading stuff on Earth, gathering information from the front lines of Corner Office.\u000A\u000AOctober 3, 2009: Want to Talk to the Chief? Book Your Half-HourWhoa, sure, does that mean I\u0027m in the next round? I really enjoy things divided into half-hour segments like sitcoms and kayak rentals. \u000A\u000ANovember 15, 2009: Are You a Tigger, or an Eeyore?Corner Office! You are finally speaking my language. In terms of these archetypes, I am actually the figure of the \u0022wise owl\u0022 or the smart-ass-loner. \u000A\u000ANovember 22, 2009: 68 Rules? No, Just 3 Are EnoughI can\u0027t tell you how happy I am that you have reduced the number of rules from 68 to 3. It\u0027s chill. It\u0027s minimalist. It\u0027s reasonable. If you don\u0027t want to people to break rules, just make fewer rules. That\u0027s what I always say. Basically I admire your management decisions and also your ability to aggressively negotiate from 68 down to 3. \u000A\u000ANovember 29, 2009: Don\u0027t Ask ‘How Are You?\u0027 Unless You Mean ItI actually fully agree with this.   \u000A\u000ADecember 20, 2009: What Makes You Roar?Let\u0027s see: cars when I\u0027m biking, bikes when I\u0027m walking, automatic staplers, elevators lurching, so mostly the pattern here is machines that surprise me?  To be frank, I don\u0027t know what you meant at all by this question. \u000A\u000AFebruary 21, 2010: Should I Hire You? I\u0027ll Ask the ReceptionistThat was a bit of a cruel twist!\u000A\u000AMarch 7, 2010: An Office? She\u0027ll Pass on ThatWho needs it right? Sounds worth passing on for sure.  \u000A\u000AApril 4, 2010: Where Are You When the Going Gets Tough?BYE!\u000A\u000AApril 25, 2010: What\u0027s Wrong With Saying \u0027I Don\u0027t Know\u0027?Oh, people will question your authority, not only regarding this specific inquiry but for everything you have ever done before. It\u0027s a dangerous road and you\u0027re really best knowing everything and answering everything confidently, I think! \u000A\u000AMay 23, 2010: Career Ladder? It\u0027s Time for a New MetaphorProfessional stairs? A job pyramid? I mean honestly, I don\u0027t want to shake things up but the iambic pentameter to the phrase is really pleasing. \u000A\u000AJune 20, 2010: Want the Job? Tell Him the Meaning of LifeOnly if you\u0027re hiring for young philosopher! But yes, sure, being interested in sustained employment is probably the main motivation for reading Corner Office columns. \u000A\u000AJune 27, 2010: The X Factor When Hiring? Call It ‘Presence\u0027I don\u0027t understand. \u000A\u000AAugust 15, 2010: Team Insights? Just Use Your Peripheral VisionNo shots, but that sounds like a panicky thing you say at the end of the meeting when you weren\u0027t listening. \u000A\u000ASeptember 26, 2010: Want to Lead? Steer Clear of Rarefied AirUm, okay! As long as everyone gets to take turns. \u000A\u000AOctober 3, 2010: Does Your Team Have the Four Essential Types?If the four types are earth, air, fire, and water and you count a house plant, air conditioned oxygen, lighters, and a half-empty bottle of Deer Park, yes, all four! Complete package over here. \u000A\u000AOctober 24, 2010: Yes, You\u0027re Smart. But Can You Make Money?Oh my goodness, thank you. That\u0027s really nice of you to say. I mean, I always thought so, but it\u0027s just nice to hear it from someone else. What was the question again?\u000A\u000ANovember 21, 2010: Can You Handle the 100-Day To-Do List?That sounds like a lot of days to complete anything, so sure, I bet I could do that. \u000A\u000ANovember 28, 2010: Defensive? It Leads to DestructiveAre you questioning my response to the previous question? Because I\u0027m actually really good at time management and I feel like you\u0027re being a little rash and I\u0027ll obliterate everything!!!!\u000A\u000ADecember 26, 2010: The Resume? No, Let\u0027s Talk About YouI love talking about me. I think everyone does, really. \u000A\u000AJanuary 2, 2011: Got an Idea? Sell It to Me in 30 SecondsHonestly, there are way more questions than I thought there would be when I started answering all of these. I have no more ideas.\u000A\u000AFebruary 6, 2011: Meeting Space? In Her Eyes, Less Is MoreI would like to answer this question as if it about greeting the universe, in which case, I would like to say that we meet space every day in some sort of fashion. \u000A\u000AFebruary 27, 2011: Want Clarity? Learn to Play Devil\u0027s AdvocateVery much. This is a foolish project. \u000A\u000AMarch 27, 2011: What\u0027s the Mission? Your Troops Want to Hear It From YouThe mission was to answer all of these questions in a reasonable format. I currently have no troops who want to hear anything from me. \u000A\u000AMay 22, 2011: The Right Job? It\u0027s Much Like the Right SpouseBecause both require written contracts and involve changes in your tax forms. I get it. \u000A\u000AJune 5, 2011: Power? Thanks, but I\u0027d Rather Have InfluenceWe would all like to have a lot of things. You can also want more than one thing at a time, I don\u0027t know if you knew that was an option, but it very much is. \u000A\u000AJune 12, 2011: Got an M.B.A.? Great, but I Prefer Uncommon SenseDude, honestly, I do not. Really can\u0027t believe you either haven\u0027t figured that out by now. I\u0027m clearly not apt to talk about business in any fashion. \u000A\u000ASeptember 4, 2011: Want to Lead? Ask Tennyson and ShakespeareOh god, honestly if I have to talk to them about it, I\u0027ll just sit in the back, thanks. \u000A\u000ASeptember 11, 2011: Want to Inspire? Don\u0027t Sugarcoat Your FeedbackAccording to posters and coffee mugs, sugary feedback is seen as the most inspirational. \u000A\u000AOctober 16, 2011: Made a Mistake? Just Treat Us to Ice CreamAgain: people are super into sugar. \u000A\u000ANovember 20, 2011: Want to Lead? Learn to Nurture Your ButterfliesYou just asked me that question, I read a lot of poetry and a lot of scripts because that\u0027s what you told me to do.  \u000A\u000AFebruary 19, 2012: Do You Share Our Goals? Sign Our ConstitutionHuh. Do you mind if I ask, just to check off some bases, that this is not in any way a cult?\u000A\u000AMarch 18, 2012: Can\u0027t Acknowledge Failure? Don\u0027t ApplyYou don\u0027t know that about me! \u000A\u000AMarch 25, 2012: Want to Innovate? Feed a Cookie to the MonsterOkay, wow, I actually feel like you should explain the parameters of this situation before you make me answer the question. \u000A\u000AApril 22, 2012: What\u0027s Your Story? Tell It, and You May Win a PrizeMy best story, in my opinion, involves the rapid death of three goldfish I owned. But if you mean generally, \u0022what\u0027s your story?\u0022 sounds like a question someone who wasn\u0027t invited to the party asks you as they block your access to the fridge beers. \u000A\u000AJune 3, 2012: Yes, You\u0027re Smart, but What About Your Topspin?Again, can\u0027t tell you guys enough about how I like it when you foreground my intelligence. My topspin—oh you know, pretty good, I\u0027ve got a two-handed backhand so yeah, it\u0027s pretty strong.\u000A\u000AJuly 22, 2012: Your Company Can Deliver, but Can It Discover?I don\u0027t have a company. I know we just agreed to ditch resumes, but I sense that it would be helpful for you to know that I did not select a practical major in college, to put it lightly.  \u000A\u000ANovember 4, 2012: If I Hire You, What\u0027s Your 100-Day Plan?Wait the last time we talked about 100 days, you said you were going to give me a to-do list. One thing you should know about me is that I have a keen memory for stuff that just happened.\u000A\u000ADecember 16, 2012: What\u0027s Your Story? The Answer May Land You a JobWait the last guy just offered me a prize you\u0027re giving me a job!? Is this negotiating? It feels great, a complete rush! \u000A\u000AFebruary 17, 2013: So Why Are You at Your Desk on a Sunday?Oh my goodness, dude, it\u0027s because there were way more rhetorical questions than I thought when I signed onto this brute force project. You\u0027re part of the problem, friend!\u000A\u000AApril 5, 2013: Want to Innovate? Get Ready to Kiss Some FrogsFeeding cookies to monsters, macking on some amphibians. You guys do not make this sound appealing. \u000A\u000AApril 21, 2013: Sure, Your References Like You. But What Would Your Critics Say?Bites off more than she can chew, re: analysis of New York Times columns. I am not saying that you have set me up an impossible river without so much as a kayak that we discussed earlier, but maybe I am saying that. \u000A\u000AJune 7, 2013: Want Investors? Skip the Glossy Sales PitchesHonestly skipping anything right now sounds excellent. \u000A\u000AJune 14, 2013: That\u0027s a Good Idea. But First, Can You Put It in Writing?Literally my job. \u000A\u000AJuly 25, 2014: You May Be Smart, but Can You Manage Your Time?Okay, wait you know I love when you begin questions that way, but can I just note it\u0027s been NEARLY A YEAR since the last rhetorical question? I was like NYT, do you even care how I\u0027m doing right now? Long time no chat! \u000A\u000AAugust 17, 2014: Is It the Cards, or How You Play Them?I feel that you have stolen this question from a discarded Eagles lyric, but I believe the correct answer is \u0022both.\u0022 No, I do not want to discuss the Eagles, I regret that I brought them up. \u000A\u000AFebruary 28, 2015: ‘Where Are You in Your Journey of Life?\u0027Hard pass. I mean, actually hold on, I am here reading that question and thinking about how much I hate its entire premise. \u000A\u000AApril 18, 2015: No, Really, What\u0027s Your Weakness?Wrath. Exhibit A: my current \u0027tude. \u000A\u000AJuly 11, 2015: Is Empathy on Your Résumé?No. I do not put \u0022empathy\u0022 on my resume. I am fully out of generous feelings and where would I even list that?  \u000A\u000AAugust 22, 2015:  \u0027Who Will Do What by When?\u0027Okay, Corner Office. Thank you. I really thought that we were going to end this on a terrible note, but I actually respect the salt out of this question. Truly, and I just looked back, this seems to me to be the best question of this whole darn lot. And there were so many! Did you know that you have asked 54 rhetorical questions in your time on Earth and on The New York Times? I certainly did not. It has taken six years and five months and the Corner Office rhetorical question team has nailed it. \u000A\u000ASo, NYT Corner Office? Did I pass the C.E.O. test? Eagerly awaiting your response,\u000A\u000AMaggie",

Test?&#x201D;</a> Since that moment, Corner Office has been populating its headlines with a parade of perpetually vague questions. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.3">There is something about the authority of this column that begs an immediate response. One sits up straight, like it&#x2019;s a job interview and says, <em>I believe I can pass the C.E.O. test, if given the opportunity to pass the C.E.O. test, I would be an excellent candidate for consideration to pass the C.E.O. test</em>. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.5">With that attitude, here are all my answers to every question asked, posed, and put forth by Corner Office column headlines since their inception. There are 54. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.6">March 15, 2009: <strong>Can You Pass a C.E.O. Test?</strong><br>Right out the gate, <em>New York Times</em>! I&#x2019;m not put off by your question style at all. I feel that this whole endeavor will test whether or not I can pass the proverbial C.E.O. test, that I certainly knew existed before it was mentioned to me just now. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.7">June 14, 2009:  <strong>Would You Be a Solvent, or the Glue?</strong><br>According to the wisdom of the playground, one usually selects to be rubber rather than glue. Solvent, a fun new element which I could certainly define but won&#x2019;t, seems suitable for a schoolyard one-upmanship. I&apos;ll be a solvent. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.8">July 5, 2009: <strong>Charisma? To Her, It&apos;s Overrated</strong><br>I would love some of that, thank you. Oh, just heard you finish that thought. Yeah, totally, mark that thing as overrated. Don&apos;t touch the stuff, myself. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.9">August 16, 2009: <strong>You Want Insights?

Book Your Half-Hour</strong><br>Whoa, sure, does that mean I&#x2019;m in the next round? I really enjoy things divided into half-hour segments like sitcoms and kayak rentals. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.b">November 15, 2009: <strong>Are You a Tigger, or an Eeyore?</strong><br>Corner Office! You are finally speaking my language. In terms of these archetypes, I am actually the figure of the &#x201C;wise owl&#x201D; or the smart-ass-loner. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.c">November 22, 2009: <strong>68 Rules? No, Just 3 Are Enough</strong><br>I can&apos;t tell you how happy I am that you have reduced the number of rules from 68 to 3. It&#x2019;s chill. It&#x2019;s minimalist. It&apos;s reasonable. If you don&#x2019;t want to people to break rules, just make fewer rules. That&#x2019;s what I always say. Basically I admire your management decisions and also your ability to aggressively negotiate from 68 down to 3. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.d">November 29, 2009: <strong>Don&#x2019;t Ask &#x2018;How Are You?&#x2019; Unless You Mean It</strong><br>I actually fully agree with this.   </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.e">December 20, 2009: <strong>What Makes You Roar?</strong><br>Let&#x2019;s see: cars when I&#x2019;m biking, bikes when I&#x2019;m walking, automatic staplers, elevators lurching, so mostly the pattern here is machines that surprise me?  To be frank, I don&#x2019;t know what you meant at all by this question. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.f">February 21, 2010: <strong>Should I Hire You? I&#x2019;ll Ask the Receptionist</strong><br>That was a bit of a cruel twist!</p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.g">March 7, 2010: <strong>An Office? She&#x2019;ll Pass on That</strong><br>Who needs it right?

It&#x2019;s a dangerous road and you&#x2019;re really best knowing everything and answering everything confidently, I think! </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.j">May 23, 2010: <strong>Career Ladder? It&#x2019;s Time for a New Metaphor</strong><br>Professional stairs? A job pyramid? I mean honestly, I don&#x2019;t want to shake things up but the iambic pentameter to the phrase is really pleasing. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.k">June 20, 2010: <strong>Want the Job? Tell Him the Meaning of Life</strong><br>Only if you&#x2019;re hiring for young philosopher! But yes, sure, being interested in sustained employment is probably the main motivation for reading Corner Office columns. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.l">June 27, 2010: <strong>The X Factor When Hiring? Call It &#x2018;Presence&#x2019;</strong><br>I don&#x2019;t understand. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.m">August 15, 2010: <strong>Team Insights? Just Use Your Peripheral Vision</strong><br>No shots, but that sounds like a panicky thing you say at the end of the meeting when you weren&#x2019;t listening. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.n">September 26, 2010: <strong>Want to Lead?

Complete package over here. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.p">October 24, 2010: <strong>Yes, You&#x2019;re Smart. But Can You Make Money?</strong><br>Oh my goodness, thank you. That&#x2019;s really nice of you to say. I mean, I always thought so, but it&#x2019;s just nice to hear it from someone else. What was the question again?</p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.q">November 21, 2010: <strong>Can You Handle the 100-Day To-Do List?</strong><br>That sounds like a lot of days to complete anything, so sure, I bet I could do that. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.r">November 28, 2010: <strong>Defensive? It Leads to Destructive</strong><br>Are you questioning my response to the previous question?

You can also want more than one thing at a time, I don&#x2019;t know if you knew that was an option, but it very much is. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.z">June 12, 2011: <strong>Got an M.B.A.? Great, but I Prefer Uncommon Sense</strong><br>Dude, honestly, I do not. Really can&#x2019;t believe you either haven&#x2019;t figured that out by now.

Tell It, and You May Win a Prize</strong><br>My best story, in my opinion, involves the rapid death of three goldfish I owned. But if you mean generally, &#x201C;what&#x2019;s your story?&#x201D; sounds like a question someone who wasn&#x2019;t invited to the party asks you as they block your access to the fridge beers. </p><p data-reactid=".393us8u2gw.1.1.0.0.4.18">June 3, 2012: <strong>Yes, You&apos;re Smart, but What About Your Topspin?</strong><br>Again, can&#x2019;t tell you guys enough about how I like it when you foreground my intelligence.
