  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Conspiracy buffs usually start out with one foot firmly planted in reality, leaving the other foot free to do the Hokey Pokey. E.g., John F. Kennedy really did get shot in Dallas 50 years ago, giving every assassination freak\u0027s homemade Mafia-CIA-Castro house of cards something solid to rest on. People who start out with one foot vaporously but vigorously planted in fiction, on the other hand—but are just as certain that they alone possess the key—used to be confined to places where their monomania had some status, meaning college English departments and tolerance-minded alt-weekly film sections.\u000A\u000AHence the fascination of Room 237, Rodney Ascher\u0027s new doc about the buried messages and coded themes some mighty obsessive folks have detected in Stanley Kubrick\u0027s 1980 screen adaptation of Stephen King\u0027s The Shining. With one exception—film historian Geoffrey Cocks, who\u0027s convinced it\u0027s Kubrick\u0027s statement on the Holocaust—none of them have any professional stake in their passion. Nor are they too clear about what provoked them to make unpacking this 33-year-old movie their mission in life. At least UFO nuts have the excuse that proof of visitors from other planets—let alone that Lee Harvey Oswald was one of them—truly would rock our world.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not as if Room 237\u0027s theorists don\u0027t have ancestors. People have been coming up for decades with ingenious if cuckoo explanations of L. Frank Baum\u0027s The Wizard of Oz as an allegory of the period\u0027s economics and/or politics. I still fondly remember the pal who—undaunted that the book had come out in 1900—once gave me a totally brilliant rundown on why the 1939 MGM movie was subliminal propaganda meant to rally the West\u0027s democracies against Hitler. (The Cowardly Lion was England, and so on.) For that matter, when critic Edmund Wilson made the case that the ghosts in Henry James\u0027s The Turn of The Screw were just projections of the heroine\u0027s repressed hysteria, the literary world laughed before deciding he was probably right.\u000A\u000ANonetheless, we live in uncommonly fertile times for people into decoding the hidden meaning of pretty much whatever tilts their kilt. Not only does home video let them go on scrutinizing the \u0022evidence\u0022 until they wake up one day and realize they\u0027re 80, but the Internet gives them a platform and a way to swap finds with kindred spirits. By encouraging fans to treat every piece of trivia as a potential tip-off to the grand design, Lost turned this kind of treasure hunt into a nationwide parlor game some time ago. The only oddity of Room 237\u0027s Kubrick buffs is the particular film they\u0027re devoted to analyzing and re-analyzing until E.T. phones home.\u000A\u000ASo it seems a tad old-fashioned of Ascher to present them as oddballs whose gaga hobby the rest of us ought to snicker at. If it\u0027s supposed to be some kind of flaw that they\u0027ve got nothing better to do, the 21st century may go down in history as the era when humanity realized that none of us have anything better to do. They\u0027re mostly just disembodied voices on the soundtrack, yammering on over clips from not only The Shining but a slew of other movies, which are often—and often wittily—chosen for satiric counterpoint, not confirmation. The effect is to lump the spinners together as if their spins on the movie are equally daft, though they aren\u0027t.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s why Ascher\u0027s ace in the hole is one Jay Weidner, who thinks The Shining is Kubrick\u0027s veiled apology/confession for helping to fake the TV coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing way back in 1969. Weidner is definitely someone you\u0027d want to tiptoe away from in a bar, not least since the idea that the TV images from Tranquility Base were faked is his minor premise and Kubrick\u0027s involvement is his major one. But unless I\u0027m seriously misreading Ascher\u0027s intentions—and I may be, which could just mean his ecution is inept—Room 237 uses Weidner to invalidate everybody else\u0027s take as well, as if looking for disguised messages in any movie at all is preposterous by definition.\u000A\u000ANot in my house, it isn\u0027t. Most months, it pays the fucking mortgage. I could wish that Cocks (the Holocaust theorist) was less fixated on numerology; he\u0027s hooked on any multiplication or division of \u002242\u0022 that bolsters his case, 1942 having been when the Final Solution was launched in earnest. But that kind of silly ransacking aside, it\u0027s in no way absurd to interpret The Shining as Kubrick\u0027s veiled Holocaust movie. The director was obsessed enough with the camps to consider making an unveiled one for years until Schindler\u0027s List scooped him.\u000A\u000AEven less out of left field is ABC News correspondent Bill Blakemore\u0027s conviction that The Shining means us to reflect on our slaughter of Native Americans. Barry Nelson\u0027s loaded remark early on that the Overlook Hotel was built on an Indian burial ground is more than a hint that the subject was indeed on Kubrick\u0027s menu, and there\u0027s plenty of other stuff right on the screen to boost Blakemore\u0027s case.\u000A\u000ANote also that these two theories don\u0027t contradict each other. If Kubrick meant The Shining to dramatize what genocidal fury looks like when it\u0027s up close and personal, then allusions to both the Final Solution and American Indians are hardly off topic. Cocks and Blakemore may be over-insistent, because that\u0027s how it goes with pet passions. But their intensity doesn\u0027t make them flat-out wrong.\u000A\u000AWeidner\u0027s Apollo 11 fantasies aside, the same goes for a lot of the other stuff we hear. We may be a tad incredulous at its elaborateness, but it\u0027s not totally stupid. Some of it, like one contributor\u0027s demonstration of how Kubrick uses the hotel\u0027s layout to play games with our perceptions or the link somebody else makes between Room 237 itself and the chamber Keir Dullea enters at the end of 2001, is just pretty good film criticism.\u000A\u000AMe, I\u0027m not even a Kubrick fan. The Shining is the only one of his later movies I like at all. But it\u0027s obviously not ridiculous to think that he, of all directors, may have planted all sorts of Easter eggs for hardcore fans to discover, especially since he knew that, after 2001, he could count on legions of viewers to puzzle over the arcana in every frame he shot. He did have that in common with Vladimir Nabokov, whose Lolita he filmed by way of cementing both men\u0027s renown.\u000A\u000ASo I can\u0027t help being curious how my colleagues will react to Room 237. What these monomaniacs do for love is just an exaggerated, cartoonish version of what we do for a living. Any of us who\u0027ve labored hard to explain what we think is really up in this or that film, then gotten abusive emails telling us to get a life because Fill in The Blank, the latest hit from that great director, John Q. Publicity, is only a movie—and we all have—ought to feel solidarity, not contempt, for Room 237\u0027s besotted explicators.\u000A\u000ASo long as we leave Apollo 11 out of it, anyhow. Anyone who knows much about either party knows that the U.S. government would never have been smart enough to offer Kubrick the gig and that the great Stanley would have turned them down if they had. Partly thanks to the stiff staging, inept acting—Neil Armstrong never did go on to much—and overall absence of cinematic vim, my own hunch is that the guy who did fake the moon landings was veteran Hollywood hack Richard Fleischer. I can point you to the scenes in Tora! Tora! Tora!—Fleischer\u0027s predictably cardboard 1970 (aha!) epic about the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl (white and round like the moon, get it?) Harbor—that subtly reveal his guilt and shame.",

usually start out with one foot firmly planted in reality, leaving the other foot free to do the Hokey Pokey. E.g., John F. Kennedy really did get shot in Dallas 50 years ago, giving every assassination freak&apos;s homemade Mafia-CIA-Castro house of cards something solid to rest on. People who start out with one foot vaporously but vigorously planted in fiction, on the other hand&#x2014;but are just as certain that they alone possess the key&#x2014;used to be confined to places where their monomania had some status, meaning college English departments and tolerance-minded alt-weekly film sections.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.2">Hence the fascination of <em>Room 237, </em>Rodney Ascher&apos;s new doc about the buried messages and coded themes some mighty obsessive folks have detected in Stanley Kubrick&apos;s 1980 screen adaptation of Stephen King&apos;s <em>The Shining</em>. With one exception&#x2014;film historian Geoffrey Cocks, who&apos;s convinced it&apos;s Kubrick&apos;s statement on the Holocaust&#x2014;none of them have any professional stake in their passion. Nor are they too clear about what provoked them to make unpacking this 33-year-old movie their mission in life. At least UFO nuts have the excuse that proof of visitors from other planets&#x2014;let alone that Lee Harvey Oswald was one of them&#x2014;truly would rock our world.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.3">It&apos;s not as if <em>Room 237</em>&apos;s theorists don&apos;t have ancestors. People have been coming up for decades with ingenious if cuckoo explanations of L. Frank Baum&apos;s <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> as an allegory of the period&apos;s economics and/or politics. I still fondly remember the pal who&#x2014;undaunted that the book had come out in 1900&#x2014;once gave me a totally brilliant rundown on why the 1939 MGM movie was subliminal propaganda meant to rally the West&apos;s democracies against Hitler. (The Cowardly Lion was England, and so on.) For that matter, when critic Edmund Wilson made the case that the ghosts in Henry James&apos;s <em>The Turn of The Screw </em>were just projections of the heroine&apos;s repressed hysteria, the literary world laughed before deciding he was probably right.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.5">Nonetheless, we live in uncommonly fertile times for people into decoding the hidden meaning of pretty much whatever tilts their kilt. Not only does home video let them go on scrutinizing the &quot;evidence&quot; until they wake up one day and realize they&apos;re 80, but the Internet gives them a platform and a way to swap finds with kindred spirits. By encouraging fans to treat every piece of trivia as a potential tip-off to the grand design, <em>Lost </em>turned this kind of treasure hunt into a nationwide parlor game some time ago. The only oddity of <em>Room 237</em>&apos;s Kubrick buffs is the particular film they&apos;re devoted to analyzing and re-analyzing until E.T. phones home.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.6">So it seems a tad old-fashioned of Ascher to present them as oddballs whose gaga hobby the rest of us ought to snicker at. If it&apos;s supposed to be some kind of flaw that they&apos;ve got nothing better to do, the 21st century may go down in history as the era when humanity realized that<em> none</em> of us have anything better to do. They&apos;re mostly just disembodied voices on the soundtrack, yammering on over clips from not only <em>The Shining </em>but a slew of other movies, which are often&#x2014;and often wittily&#x2014;chosen for satiric counterpoint, not confirmation. The effect is to lump the spinners together as if their spins on the movie are equally daft, though they aren&apos;t.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.7">That&apos;s why Ascher&apos;s ace in the hole is one Jay Weidner, who thinks <em>The Shining </em>is Kubrick&apos;s veiled apology/confession for helping to fake the TV coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing way back in 1969. Weidner is definitely someone you&apos;d want to tiptoe away from in a bar, not least since the idea that the TV images from Tranquility Base were faked is his minor premise and Kubrick&apos;s involvement is his major one. But unless I&apos;m seriously misreading Ascher&apos;s intentions&#x2014;and I may be, which could just mean his ecution is inept&#x2014;<em>Room 237 </em>uses Weidner to invalidate everybody else&apos;s take as well, as if looking for disguised messages in any movie at all is preposterous by definition.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.8">Not in my house, it isn&apos;t. Most months, it pays the fucking mortgage. I could wish that Cocks (the Holocaust theorist) was less fixated on numerology; he&apos;s hooked on any multiplication or division of &quot;42&quot; that bolsters his case, 1942 having been when the Final Solution was launched in earnest. But that kind of silly ransacking aside, it&apos;s in no way absurd to interpret <em>The Shining </em>as Kubrick&apos;s veiled Holocaust movie. The director was obsessed enough with the camps to consider making an unveiled one for years until <em>Schindler&apos;s List </em>scooped him.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.9">Even less out of left field is ABC News correspondent Bill Blakemore&apos;s conviction that <em>The Shining </em>means us to reflect on our slaughter of Native Americans. Barry Nelson&apos;s loaded remark early on that the Overlook Hotel was built on an Indian burial ground is more than a hint that the subject was indeed on Kubrick&apos;s menu, and there&apos;s plenty of other stuff right on the screen to boost Blakemore&apos;s case.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.a">Note also that these two theories don&apos;t contradict each other. If Kubrick meant <em>The Shining </em>to dramatize what genocidal fury looks like when it&apos;s up close and personal, then allusions to both the Final Solution and American Indians are hardly off topic. Cocks and Blakemore may be over-insistent, because that&apos;s how it goes with pet passions. But their intensity doesn&apos;t make them flat-out wrong.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.b">Weidner&apos;s Apollo 11 fantasies aside, the same goes for a lot of the other stuff we hear. We may be a tad incredulous at its elaborateness, but it&apos;s not totally stupid. Some of it, like one contributor&apos;s demonstration of how Kubrick uses the hotel&apos;s layout to play games with our perceptions or the link somebody else makes between Room 237 itself and the chamber Keir Dullea enters at the end of <em>2001</em>, is just pretty good film criticism.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.c">Me, I&apos;m not even a Kubrick fan. <em>The Shining </em>is the only one of his later movies I like at all. But it&apos;s obviously not ridiculous to think that he, of all directors, may have planted all sorts of Easter eggs for hardcore fans to discover, especially since he knew that, after <em>2001, </em>he could count on legions of viewers to puzzle over the arcana in every frame he shot. He did have that in common with Vladimir Nabokov, whose <em>Lolita </em>he filmed by way of cementing both men&apos;s renown.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.d">So I can&apos;t help being curious how my colleagues will react to <em>Room 237. </em>What these monomaniacs do for love is just an exaggerated, cartoonish version of what we do for a living. Any of us who&apos;ve labored hard to explain what we think is <em>really </em>up in this or that film, then gotten abusive emails telling us to get a life because <em>Fill in The Blank, </em>the latest hit from that great director, John Q. Publicity, is only a movie&#x2014;and we all have&#x2014;ought to feel solidarity, not contempt, for <em>Room 237</em>&apos;s besotted explicators.</p><p data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.4.e">So long as we leave Apollo 11 out of it, anyhow. Anyone who knows much about either party knows that the U.S. government would never have been smart enough to offer Kubrick the gig and that the great Stanley would have turned them down if they had. Partly thanks to the stiff staging, inept acting&#x2014;Neil Armstrong never did go on to much&#x2014;and overall absence of cinematic vim, my own hunch is that the guy who <em>did </em>fake the moon landings was veteran Hollywood hack Richard Fleischer. I can point you to the scenes in <em>Tora! Tora! Tora!&#x2014;</em>Fleischer&apos;s predictably cardboard 1970 (aha!) epic about the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl (white and round like the moon, get it?) Harbor&#x2014;that subtly reveal his guilt and shame.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".kshxhqoi68.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
