  	    "articleBody": "I went out with a guy recently. It was one of those dates where nothing stuck out other than \u0022I didn\u0027t hate it\u0022 and the fact that he probably wasn\u0027t an axe murderer. I do remember that he was wearing nail polish on one nail and was painfully boring (all cons), but he was pretty nice, hot, and I stayed at the bar a long time. So that\u0027s something. \u000A\u000ALike all first dates, it was still going to need a second date to confirm or deny any \u0022you should be my boyfriend, probably\u0022 feelings. Eventually we settled on seeing each other on a Saturday for a second date, which was about a week away. The night of the actual date, however, and after not hearing from him for a few days, I got a text at 4 P.M. that just said \u00228/9?\u0022\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s it. Eight fucking nine. Like a plumber trying to see if you\u0027ll be home so he can unclog your toilet.\u000A\u000AAlready having a low threshold for this dude, I didn\u0027t write him back for hours, and eventually said I wasn\u0027t sure I could make it because I wasn\u0027t feeling well. And then it happened: He got really mad.\u000A\u000AWhen I told him I wished I could have made it, he said, \u0022You are the queen of flakes. Well, I\u0027ve already started my night without you. Let\u0027s try another time.\u0022\u000A\u000ASeeing as I have an ironclad reputation for doing literally everything I say I\u0027m going to do, and giving ample time to let people know when I can\u0027t do said thing, I was livid. Mainly because my tactic up until that point had been, Well, at least this is better than ghosting, a.k.a. never replying to another message again and just vanishing without a trace. \u000A\u000AWait, did you seriously think this was fun? I don\u0027t think you know what fun is. Have you ever had fun?Twitter\u000A\u000AI wanted to write him back and tell him I wouldn\u0027t have flaked, but I didn\u0027t enjoy how he spoke to me like he was the captain of the football team and I was the girl with a comically sized back brace. In actuality, I was just trying to find a nice way of saying, \u0022Hey! You weren\u0027t overtly mean to me on our first date, but also I probably could\u0027ve taken a nap during it. Wait, did you seriously think this was fun? I don\u0027t think you know what fun is. Have you ever had fun?\u0022\u000A\u000AIt then occurred to me that most of the time when I\u0027ve ghosted someone, it was because I had so many problems with them that it didn\u0027t even make sense to go through the list. I hate the it\u0027s-not-you-it\u0027s-me B.S. because, let\u0027s be honest, it\u0027s totally them. Besides, if you don\u0027t ghost, you basically have three options. They all suck.\u000A\u000AYou can:\u000A\u000AHurt their feelings by being blunt.Lie to them and tell them something vague, which will only confuse them more.Be super careful about how you relay the information and hope they don\u0027t turn into a rage tornado who calls you an ugly troll-whore for no reason, even though they probably will.\u000A\u000AI asked a few female friends, all seasoned ghosters, the reasons why they did it—and their logic often echoed mine. Jamie said she used to ghost people all the time because she hated having to list all the reasons they were not right for her. She also favored it over the prototypical \u0022We can totally still be friends while you vainly pine after me, and I\u0027ll allow it because, sue me, I love a good ego boost\u0022 speech, which, well, same.\u000A\u000AWhile Jamie\u0027s reasons for ghosting are very common for the women I spoke with, there\u0027s also the issue of the guy blowing up at you when you\u0027re just being honest with him: Low blows. Yelling. Threats of potential (and real) violence. No one should have to put up with that shit.\u000A\u000AThe sad thing is, my friend Sean says that when women have ghosted him, he really did wish they\u0027d have just been honest. \u0022If she had been up front with me, I probably would have been as upset, but I would have gotten over it far more quickly,\u0022 he told me. \u0022Going from texting every day and seeing each other a couple times a week to nothing without the slightest hint of why was a kick in the gut.\u0022 The \u0022truth\u0022 or some sort of \u0022polite dismissal,\u0022 he said, \u0022would have been preferable.\u0022\u000A\u000AWomen are socialized to spend so much of their time catering to everyone\u0027s feelings but their own. When you break it off with someone, sometimes you\u0027re just fed up.Twitter\u000A\u000AI\u0027m sure a lot of guys feel like Sean. Yet my friend Cate brought up an incredibly valid point: Women are socialized to spend so much of their time catering to everyone\u0027s feelings but their own. When you break it off with someone, sometimes you\u0027re just fed up. \u0022The majority of the time, it\u0027s all about me not wanting to waste another second of my time worrying about someone else\u0027s feelings,\u0022 she said. \u0022That\u0027s what I spent the first 23 years of my life doing.\u0022 Cate added that when she\u0027s ghosted or feels like someone is trying to start that forced conversation, she moves on because she sees it as wholly unnecessary. \u000A\u000ATons of guys wonder all the time why they\u0027re being ghosted, wanting to chalk it up to flaky girls or girls who don\u0027t care. But every woman I spoke to said if some random guy was a jerk, why was it worth their time to break it down for him? Even if he doesn\u0027t yell or lose his shit for their honesty, it\u0027s still more time that they don\u0027t want to spend with him, which is totally reasonable. \u000A\u000AWhile I feel for my friend Sean, it\u0027s so much more beneficial for men (and women) to just take ghosting for what it is: subtracting the bullshit. At least they didn\u0027t make you sit through a lecture on your shortcomings—or, worse, theirs. (Who enjoys that hour-long \u0022It\u0027s just like/from my perspective/I\u0027m at a place where/why do I have to explain to you why I think you\u0027re boring?\u0022 conversation?!)\u000A\u000AAt the end of the day, you should want someone who doesn\u0027t have so many problems with your incompatibility that never speaking to you again seems preferable to having to explain to you why you\u0027re not as cool as her ex, or Dave at work, or her roommate who smells weird but at least he doesn\u0027t wear goth jewelry. She ghosted you because she was the wrong one. Now go out and find the right one.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ALane Moore (@hellolanemoore) is a comedian, writer, and musician based in New York City.",

data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.0">I went out with a guy recently. It was one of those dates where nothing stuck out other than &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t hate it&#x201D; and the fact that he probably wasn&#x2019;t an axe murderer. I do remember that he was wearing nail polish on one nail and was painfully boring (all cons), but he was pretty nice, hot, and I stayed at the bar a long time. So that&#x2019;s something. </p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.1">Like all first dates, it was still going to need a second date to confirm or deny any &#x201C;you should be my boyfriend, probably&#x201D; feelings. Eventually we settled on seeing each other on a Saturday for a second date, which was about a week away. The night of the actual date, however, and after not hearing from him for a few days, I got a text at 4 P.M. that just said &#x201C;8/9?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.2">That&#x2019;s it. Eight fucking nine. Like a plumber trying to see if you&#x2019;ll be home so he can unclog your toilet.</p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.3">Already having a low threshold for this dude, I didn&#x2019;t write him back for hours, and eventually said I wasn&#x2019;t sure I could make it because I wasn&#x2019;t feeling well. And then it happened: He got <em>really</em> mad.</p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.5">When I told him I wished I could have made it, he said, &#x201C;You are the queen of flakes. Well, I&#x2019;ve already started my night without you. Let&#x2019;s try another time.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.6">Seeing as I have an ironclad reputation for doing literally everything I say I&#x2019;m going to do, and giving ample time to let people know when I can&#x2019;t do said thing, I was livid. Mainly because my tactic up until that point had been, Well, at least this is better than ghosting, a.k.a. never replying to another message again and just vanishing without a trace. </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.7"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>Wait, did you seriously think this was fun?

In actuality, I was just trying to find a nice way of saying, &#x201C;Hey! You weren&#x2019;t overtly mean to me on our first date, but also I probably could&#x2019;ve taken a nap during it. Wait, did you seriously think this was fun? I don&#x2019;t think you know what fun is. Have you ever had fun?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.9">It then occurred to me that most of the time when I&#x2019;ve ghosted someone, it was because I had so many problems with them that it didn&#x2019;t even make sense to go through the list. I hate the it&#x2019;s-not-you-it&#x2019;s-me B.S. because, let&#x2019;s be honest, it&#x2019;s totally them. Besides, if you don&#x2019;t ghost, you basically have three options. They all suck.</p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.a">You can:</p><div class="embed ul" data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.b"><ul><li>Hurt their feelings by being blunt.</li><li>Lie to them and tell them something vague, which will only confuse them more.</li><li>Be super careful about how you relay the information and hope they don&#x2019;t turn into a rage tornado who calls you an ugly troll-whore for no reason, even though they probably will.</li></ul></div><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.c">I asked a few female friends, all seasoned ghosters, the reasons why they did it&#x2014;and their logic often echoed mine. Jamie said she used to ghost people all the time because she hated having to list all the reasons they were not right for her. She also favored it over the prototypical &#x201C;We can totally still be friends while you vainly pine after me, and I&#x2019;ll allow it because, sue me, I love a good ego boost&#x201D; speech, which, well, same.</p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.d">While Jamie&#x2019;s reasons for ghosting are very common for the women I spoke with, there&#x2019;s also the issue of the guy blowing up at you when you&#x2019;re just being honest with him: Low blows. Yelling. Threats of potential (and real) violence. No one should have to put up with that shit.</p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.e">The sad thing is, my friend Sean says that when women have ghosted him, he really did wish they&#x2019;d have just been honest. &#x201C;If she had been up front with me, I probably would have been as upset, but I would have gotten over it far more quickly,&#x201D; he told me. &#x201C;Going from texting every day and seeing each other a couple times a week to nothing without the slightest hint of why was a kick in the gut.&#x201D; The &#x201C;truth&#x201D; or some sort of &#x201C;polite dismissal,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;would have been preferable.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.f"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>Women are socialized to spend so much of their time catering to everyone&#x2019;s feelings but their own.

Yet my friend Cate brought up an incredibly valid point: Women are socialized to spend so much of their time catering to everyone&#x2019;s feelings but their own. When you break it off with someone, sometimes you&#x2019;re just fed up. &#x201C;The majority of the time, it&apos;s all about me not wanting to waste another second of my time worrying about someone else&#x2019;s feelings,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s what I spent the first 23 years of my life doing.&#x201D; Cate added that when she&#x2019;s ghosted or feels like someone is trying to start that forced conversation, she moves on because she sees it as wholly unnecessary. </p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.h">Tons of guys wonder all the time why they&#x2019;re being ghosted, wanting to chalk it up to flaky girls or girls who don&#x2019;t care. But every woman I spoke to said if some random guy was a jerk, why was it worth their time to break it down for him? Even if he doesn&#x2019;t yell or lose his shit for their honesty, it&#x2019;s still more time that they <em>don&#x2019;t</em> want to spend with him, which is totally reasonable. </p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.i">While I feel for my friend Sean, it&#x2019;s so much more beneficial for men (and women) to just take ghosting for what it is: subtracting the bullshit. At least they didn&#x2019;t make you sit through a lecture on your shortcomings&#x2014;or, worse, theirs. (Who enjoys that hour-long &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just like/from my perspective/I&#x2019;m at a place where/why do I have to explain to you why I think you&#x2019;re boring?&#x201D; conversation?!)</p><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.j">At the end of the day, you should want someone who doesn&#x2019;t have so many problems with your incompatibility that never speaking to you again seems preferable to having to explain to you why you&#x2019;re not as cool as her ex, or Dave at work, or her roommate who smells weird but at least he doesn&#x2019;t wear goth jewelry. She ghosted you because she was the wrong one. Now go out and find the right one.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.k"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".40n02wkum8.1.1.0.0.4.l"><em>Lane Moore (<a
