  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A  Suit With Guns: Western Style Influencers\u000A\u000ASome years ago, I was interviewing Clint Eastwood. We were sitting on couches in his office on the back lot of Warner Bros., deep in the Valley. We had walked here from a nearby soundstage, and now we sat in the small living room of the cabana, talking. Just the two of us. He had made turkey sandwiches, and when we finished eating them, Eastwood sat back in the couch and eased his legs out and onto the coffee table. A slice of late-afternoon California sun shone through the window.\u000A\u000AAt one point, as is inevitable with Eastwood, we spoke about A Fistful of Dollars, the 1964 Western that he shot with Italian director Sergio Leone in the wilds of Spain. A \u0022spaghetti Western,\u0022 they called it. At the time, Eastwood was toiling as a supporting actor in a TV Western called Rawhide. Standard 1960s TV stuff where he wore the white hat and kissed the ladies and rescued lost baby cows.\u000A\u000AEastwood wanted more for himself. More for his career. Knew he was capable of more. That\u0027s when Leone appeared with the script. Offered him $15K for two months\u0027 work. The part was the Man with No Name—a character that had not been seen in Westerns before. This was not a white hat. This was not a black hat. This was more of a gray hat. Morally ambiguous. Complicated. A man like the men who settled the frontier. A loner. An antihero. A man who, in many ways, embodied the culture of 1960s and \u002770s America. Eastwood grabbed the role. And that, you might say, was how Eastwood won. He never looked back.\u000A\u000ANow, years later, with both of us stretched out, feet on the coffee table, like two hired hands in a bunkhouse, Eastwood laughed at how little he knew going into the filming and how far away he was now from those days. At one point I asked him about his look in the movie. How he and the wardrobe people settled on his clothes: his flat-brimmed hat, the black jeans, that Mexican poncho that seemed to conceal everything about him, and those cigarillos that completed his mask. How, I asked, did you all come up with such an iconic western wardrobe for your character?\u000A\u000AEastwood looked at me and smiled. Told me that like most things that become memorable about a movie, the outfit was an afterthought.\u000A\u000A\u0022There was no money for a wardrobe. A few days before I was supposed to fly to Spain, Sergio tells me that I should bring my own clothes.\u0022 From there, Eastwood related how he pulled together a pair of boots and some spurs, trusting his vision for this character he and Leone were creating. Thinking that he wanted to dress like someone who was of the times but apart from the times. An individual. \u0022I put it all in my suitcase and flew to Spain.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd yet it is a moment all of us have known. Because all of us learned it as boys. Remember? We were 5, 6, 7 years old, in the backyard or the alley, and suddenly we learned the power of jeans, a hat, a denim jacket, maybe our father\u0027s belt hanging low on our small hips—in an instant we were transformed. We were cowboys. Drifters. Gunslingers. Outlaws on the range. In an instant, the clothes made us walk differently—made us feel less like boys and more like men.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHollywood knows all about this power, of course. From the first days of film, there were Westerns. Our culture\u0027s creation myths. How we wanted to see ourselves. Tom Mix. John Wayne. Gregory Peck. Clean-shaven men in polished boots and pressed shirts and creased pants and never a hair out of place. Even in the wilds of the frontier, we didn\u0027t just hold it together, we peacocked. But as the blissful 1960s gave way to the darker 1970s, a shadow came across the Hollywood Western—it was the rise of Eastwood\u0027s antihero. Suddenly movies and the men on-screen were mirroring the streets of America. Suddenly cowboys were stripped of their sparkle.\u000A\u000AThe \u002760s and early \u002770s were, pardon the pun, a wild time for Westerns. A singular time, really, when what was shaking out on the streets of American cities—the shagginess of men\u0027s hair, the revolution in men\u0027s style, the hunger to be seen as non-establishment—was influencing and infusing what was being created on the back lots of Hollywood. Yes, these were Westerns in name and in terms of their locations—big vistas and wide-open spaces. But they were a strain of Western we haven\u0027t seen since. Canvases for directors and actors to show not just the violent and volatile settling of the American West at the turn of the past century but also how volatile American society still was one hundred years on. And just as the films continue to live in our minds and influence Hollywood, so do the clothes.\u000A\u000AAnd just like that, one of the most unforgettable characters comes to life. Not just through the performance but through the clothes—an indelible image of the American West, created by a struggling actor on a shoestring budget.\u000A\u000AAll of this is on glorious display in 1969\u0027s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. There\u0027s a photograph I love, taken on set somewhere in Mexico, and the style is jaw-dropping. Paul Newman and Robert Redford in boots, slim-cut pants, jackets, hats cocked. You look at it and there\u0027s part of you that\u0027s not sure if these two guys are from the 1890s or the 1960s. What you are sure of is that these guys exude macho. And they ain\u0027t trying. They just is. It\u0027s a photograph that I would imagine has been on the inspiration board of just about every designer at one time or another. Because in that photo you see all the reasons we as men love westernwear. Not just for the macho factor. But also for the individuality it opens up to us. The room for inventiveness it invites. The film is right up there with another favorite, Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid, with Kris Kristofferson and (ready for this?) Bob Dylan.\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s another piece of this, too, another piece of what Hollywood and these leading men were doing on-screen and with the clothes they were wearing. I think of it as a quiet self-reliance. Just as the frontier wasn\u0027t populated solely by gunslingers, there were also the settlers—the ranchers and railroad men who came west to stake a claim or escape a previous life. Oftentimes they were men of mystery, men of few words. They didn\u0027t shout. They just had…presence.\u000A\u000APart of this was in the way their clothes fit. Look at Warren Beatty\u0027s character in McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller: He may be a roguish whorehouse proprietor, but he wore inch-perfect jackets and vests, accessorized with dandyish watch chains, wing collars, and an ever present bowler hat. He was a charismatic American individual, utterly and inexorably himself.\u000A\u000ABut no film captures what I\u0027m talking about—the swaggering macho and the brooding mysteriousness—better than Days of Heaven by Terrence Malick. There\u0027s a chance you may not have seen it, and if so, I do not pity you; I envy you. Set aside an evening. Cue it up. Not on your phone or your computer. On your wall. On as big a screen as you can find. On the side of your house, if you can. (You\u0027ll thank me later.) I could talk forever about the dialogue, about the cinematography, about how every shot and every location lingers in your mind. The clothes linger, too. In earth-toned shirts, vests, hats, and overcoats, Sam Shepard\u0027s and Richard Gere\u0027s characters matched the flan colors of the wheat fields where they worked, making the landscape all the more painterly.\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a romance to these clothes. A ruggedness. An individualism that appeals to every one of us as men.",

Here, <strong>Michael Hainey</strong> rediscovers the visionary Westerns that re-imagined what rugged Americana could look like</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.0"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583e4383655c24c6c971d76/master/w_768/style-2015-04-Western-how-the-wear-was-worn-gq-sip.jpg" alt="style-2015-04-Western-how-the-wear-was-worn-gq-sip.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwestern&amp;t=style-2015-04-Western-how-the-wear-was-worn-gq-sip.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwestern&amp;t=style-2015-04-Western-how-the-wear-was-worn-gq-sip.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwestern&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583e4383655c24c6c971d76%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2015-04-Western-how-the-wear-was-worn-gq-sip.jpg&amp;description=style-2015-04-Western-how-the-wear-was-worn-gq-sip.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwestern&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583e4383655c24c6c971d76%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2015-04-Western-how-the-wear-was-worn-gq-sip.jpg&amp;description=style-2015-04-Western-how-the-wear-was-worn-gq-sip.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.1"> <a href="http://www.gq.com/style/201503/think-of-it-as-a-suit-with-guns-western-style-influencers"><strong> Suit With Guns: Western Style Influencers</strong></a></p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.2">Some years ago, I was interviewing Clint Eastwood. We were sitting on couches in his office on the back lot of Warner Bros., deep in the Valley. We had walked here from a nearby soundstage, and now we sat in the small living room of the cabana, talking. Just the two of us. He had made turkey sandwiches, and when we finished eating them, Eastwood sat back in the couch and eased his legs out and onto the coffee table. A slice of late-afternoon California sun shone through the window.</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.3">At one point, as is inevitable with Eastwood, we spoke about <em>A Fistful of Dollars,</em> the 1964 Western that he shot with Italian director Sergio Leone in the wilds of Spain. A &quot;spaghetti Western,&quot; they called it. At the time, Eastwood was toiling as a supporting actor in a TV Western called <em>Rawhide.</em> Standard 1960s TV stuff where he wore the white hat and kissed the ladies and rescued lost baby cows.</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.5">Eastwood wanted more for himself. More for his career. Knew he was capable of more. That&#x2019;s when Leone appeared with the script. Offered him $15K for two months&#x2019; work. The part was the Man with No Name&#x2014;a character that had not been seen in Westerns before. This was not a white hat. This was not a black hat. This was more of a gray hat. Morally ambiguous. Complicated. A man like the men who settled the frontier. A loner. An antihero. A man who, in many ways, embodied the culture of 1960s and &#x2019;70s America. Eastwood grabbed the role. And that, you might say, was how Eastwood won. He never looked back.</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.6">Now, years later, with both of us stretched out, feet on the coffee table, like two hired hands in a bunkhouse, Eastwood laughed at how little he knew going into the filming and how far away he was now from those days. At one point I asked him about his look in the movie. How he and the wardrobe people settled on his clothes: his flat-brimmed hat, the black jeans, that Mexican poncho that seemed to conceal everything about him, and those cigarillos that completed his mask. How, I asked, did you all come up with such an iconic western wardrobe for your character?</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.7">Eastwood looked at me and smiled. Told me that like most things that become memorable about a movie, the outfit was an afterthought.</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.8">&quot;There was no money for a wardrobe. A few days before I was supposed to fly to Spain, Sergio tells me that I should bring my own clothes.&quot; From there, Eastwood related how he pulled together a pair of boots and some spurs, trusting his vision for this character he and Leone were creating. Thinking that he wanted to dress like someone who was of the times but apart from the times. An individual. &quot;I put it all in my suitcase and flew to Spain.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.9">And yet it is a moment all of us have known. Because all of us learned it as boys. Remember? We were 5, 6, 7 years old, in the backyard or the alley, and suddenly we learned the power of jeans, a hat, a denim jacket, maybe our father&#x2019;s belt hanging low on our small hips&#x2014;in an instant we were transformed. We were cowboys. Drifters. Gunslingers. Outlaws on the range. In an instant, the clothes made us walk differently&#x2014;made us feel less like boys and more like men.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.a"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.b"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583e4383655c24c6c971d73/master/w_768/style-2015-03-sip-how-the-west-was-won-east-sip-west-07.jpg" alt="style-2015-03-sip-how-the-west-was-won-east-sip-west-07.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwestern&amp;t=style-2015-03-sip-how-the-west-was-won-east-sip-west-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwestern&amp;t=style-2015-03-sip-how-the-west-was-won-east-sip-west-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwestern&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583e4383655c24c6c971d73%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2015-03-sip-how-the-west-was-won-east-sip-west-07.jpg&amp;description=style-2015-03-sip-how-the-west-was-won-east-sip-west-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwestern&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583e4383655c24c6c971d73%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2015-03-sip-how-the-west-was-won-east-sip-west-07.jpg&amp;description=style-2015-03-sip-how-the-west-was-won-east-sip-west-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.c">Hollywood knows all about this power, of course. From the first days of film, there were Westerns. Our culture&#x2019;s creation myths. How we wanted to see ourselves. Tom Mix. John Wayne. Gregory Peck. Clean-shaven men in polished boots and pressed shirts and creased pants and never a hair out of place. Even in the wilds of the frontier, we didn&#x2019;t just hold it together, we peacocked. But as the blissful 1960s gave way to the darker 1970s, a shadow came across the Hollywood Western&#x2014;it was the rise of Eastwood&#x2019;s antihero. Suddenly movies and the men on-screen were mirroring the streets of America. Suddenly cowboys were stripped of their sparkle.</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.d">The &#x2019;60s and early &#x2019;70s were, pardon the pun, a wild time for Westerns. A singular time, really, when what was shaking out on the streets of American cities&#x2014;the shagginess of men&#x2019;s hair, the revolution in men&#x2019;s style, the hunger to be seen as non-establishment&#x2014;was influencing and infusing what was being created on the back lots of Hollywood. Yes, these were Westerns in name and in terms of their locations&#x2014;big vistas and wide-open spaces. But they were a strain of Western we haven&#x2019;t seen since. Canvases for directors and actors to show not just the violent and volatile settling of the American West at the turn of the past century but also how volatile American society still was one hundred years on. And just as the films continue to live in our minds and influence Hollywood, so do the clothes.</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.e">And just like that, one of the most unforgettable characters comes to life. Not just through the performance but through the clothes&#x2014;an indelible image of the American West, created by a struggling actor on a shoestring budget.</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.f">All of this is on glorious display in 1969&#x2019;s <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.</em> There&#x2019;s a photograph I love, taken on set somewhere in Mexico, and the style is jaw-dropping. Paul Newman and Robert Redford in boots, slim-cut pants, jackets, hats cocked. You look at it and there&#x2019;s part of you that&#x2019;s not sure if these two guys are from the 1890s or the 1960s. What you are sure of is that these guys exude macho. And they ain&#x2019;t trying. They just is. It&#x2019;s a photograph that I would imagine has been on the inspiration board of just about every designer at one time or another. Because in that photo you see all the reasons we as men love westernwear. Not just for the macho factor. But also for the individuality it opens up to us. The room for inventiveness it invites. The film is right up there with another favorite, <em>Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid,</em> with Kris Kristofferson and (ready for this?) Bob Dylan.</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.g">There&#x2019;s another piece of this, too, another piece of what Hollywood and these leading men were doing on-screen and with the clothes they were wearing. I think of it as a quiet self-reliance. Just as the frontier wasn&#x2019;t populated solely by gunslingers, there were also the settlers&#x2014;the ranchers and railroad men who came west to stake a claim or escape a previous life. Oftentimes they were men of mystery, men of few words. They didn&#x2019;t shout. They just had&#x2026;presence.</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.h">Part of this was in the way their clothes fit. Look at Warren Beatty&#x2019;s character in <em>McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller:</em> He may be a roguish whorehouse proprietor, but he wore inch-perfect jackets and vests, accessorized with dandyish watch chains, wing collars, and an ever present bowler hat. He was a charismatic American individual, utterly and inexorably himself.</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.i">But no film captures what I&#x2019;m talking about&#x2014;the swaggering macho and the brooding mysteriousness&#x2014;better than <em>Days of Heaven</em> by Terrence Malick. There&#x2019;s a chance you may not have seen it, and if so, I do not pity you; I envy you. Set aside an evening. Cue it up. Not on your phone or your computer. On your wall. On as big a screen as you can find. On the side of your house, if you can. (You&#x2019;ll thank me later.) I could talk forever about the dialogue, about the cinematography, about how every shot and every location lingers in your mind. The clothes linger, too. In earth-toned shirts, vests, hats, and overcoats, Sam Shepard&#x2019;s and Richard Gere&#x2019;s characters matched the flan colors of the wheat fields where they worked, making the landscape all the more painterly.</p><p data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.4.j">There&#x2019;s a romance to these clothes. A ruggedness. An individualism that appeals to every one of us as men.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".27q6lwgzzsw.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col
