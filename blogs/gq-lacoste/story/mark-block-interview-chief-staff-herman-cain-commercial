  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ASCENE ONE: ATLANTA, RUSH HOUR, TWO FRIDAYS AGO\u000A\u000AI was stuck in traffic, on Peachtree Street, cursing Herman Cain. A lane was blocked off, and my path to the former CEO of Godfather\u0027s Pizza wasn\u0027t any clearer. I\u0027d been trying to track down Cain for weeks. A former Atlanta mayor, Jimmy Carter\u0027s grandson, and a member of Cain\u0027s church had been no help. I\u0027d tried a passel of connected conservative business people in Georgia, and they\u0027d shrugged, too. No one knew Cain, or had his number, or admitted it if they did. I just wanted to shoot the shit with him over a slice of pepperoni, or a scoop of black walnut—his favorite!—and see how many times he\u0027d say, in that exquisite baritone, nine-nine-nine. I wanted to immerse myself in his aura of certainty. But I\u0027d nearly given up. Screw the ice cream and pizza, I thought. I\u0027m becoming lactose intolerant anyway.\u000A\u000AThe sky was a bright blue, but the wind had a wintery edge to it. I looked around at my fellow captives caught in traffic. In front of me was a beat-up, red Chevy Blazer. It had two Herman Cain stickers on its rear window (\u0022Is America Ready for Herman Cain?\u0022 asked one). No one here in the city where Herman Cain lives had two Herman Cain stickers two weeks ago—or now, for that matter, after his surge in the polls. The odd Blazer had Wisconsin plates.\u000A\u000AThere was a man at the wheel and his window was down, his elbow resting on its sill. His hand reflexively ashed a cigarette and his face, forgettable yet familiar, flashed across the rearview mirror. He merged into the right lane, without signaling. I pulled ahead, on a hunch, and looked over: there were the cheap glasses, the graying mustache, the sallow skin and burdened jowls. He was looking down, intently, at his smartphone. Then he made a sudden right turn out of traffic; I pulled a dangerous U-turn, cut left, and followed. I had to follow. I knew that mustache.\u000A\u000AThe man pulled into a parking lot behind a gas station, just off Peachtree; I pulled into an empty driveway across the street, in a neighborhood called Sherwood Forest. Thirty seconds later, he was moving again, back towards Peachtree; so was I. Nearing the gridlock, we both stopped. I put my car in park, in the middle of the street, and got out. The man appeared unconcerned, even slightly amused, as I approached his Blazer in gym shorts. He lit another cigarette as I spoke:\u000A\u000A\u0022Are you Mark Block, Herman Cain\u0027s chief of staff? The guy from the smoking ad?\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027d watched the ad a few days before—forwarding it to friends, noting Cain\u0027s creepy, slowly evolving smile at the end, after Block\u0027s thrilling jump cut exhale—and saw Block defend it on CNN the previous night. \u0022We\u0027ve run a campaign like nobody\u0027s ever seen,\u0022 Block says in the ad, now viewed 1.5 million times on YouTube. \u0022But then, America\u0027s never seen a candidate like Herman Cain.\u0022 I agreed then, as now.\u000A\u000AThe man took a long drag from his Marlboro Light. \u0022Yes I am. Did you like it, the ad?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah,\u0022 I said. \u0022It\u0027s catchy. Look, I know this is weird, to approach you in traffic, but I\u0027m a journalist and I\u0027d like to interview you and, if possible, Mr. Cain.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe took another drag, as we exchanged business cards. \u0022Sure. That can be arranged.\u0022 He seemed sincere, without pretension or obvious guile. He read my card. Then he looked back at his phone, and said, without apparent concern: \u0022I\u0027m lost.\u0022\u000A\u000AWe talked for a few minutes before cars finally moved, me standing beside his car where he sat and smoked. He was late to a Cain event, working on four hours of sleep. He spends one day a week at campaign headquarters in Stockbridge, Georgia, and travels the rest. Wisconsin is his home, where his family lives, where he was elected to the Winnebago County Board of Supervisors when he was a clean-lunged eighteen-year-old with long hair—\u0022but not a hippie\u0022—hoping to \u0022make a difference.\u0022 His hair was short, graying and formless by 2005, when he returned to practicing politics after a three-year ban in Wisconsin, for election improprieties. It remained that way in the Blazer, in traffic, days before the breaking of the sexual harassment allegations against Herman Cain, and the seemingly haphazard explanations, from Cain and Block, that still follow.\u000A\u000AThe chief of one of the strangest campaigns in presidential history finally had to go. Traffic was moving. He put the Blazer in gear and told me to be in touch. I drove home, in my gym shorts, with his card in my hand. He continued down Peachtree, wearing that mustache, trying to find his way. He hadn\u0027t asked for help.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASCENE TWO: WASHINGTON D.C., WASHINGTON CONVENTION CENTER, 1:50 P.M., LAST FRIDAY\u000A\u000AHe shouted my name into the phone, over the din of a crowd, like we were old friends. He was backstage at the \u0027Defending the American Dream Summit,\u0027 put on by Americans for Prosperity. He was waiting for \u0022the boss\u0022 to deliver a rousing twenty-minute speech that would celebrate free markets and limited government. It would \u0022kick ass,\u0022 he said. \u0022Hear that sound? They can\u0027t wait.\u0022\u000A\u000AMark Block had dealt with a lot in the intervening week, including allegations that Cain sexually harassed at least four women some years ago; the home court clapping was a relief. Block was very upbeat, in a buzzed sort of way. He said he hadn\u0027t and wouldn\u0027t read the New York Times story, \u0022For a Close Aide to Herman Cain, Scrutiny Comes on Two Fronts,\u0022 which came out that morning and was mostly about him. I mentioned that the article claimed, among other things, that he has no sense of humor. \u0022My goodness,\u0022 he said. \u0022They must not have watched the smoking video. I laugh at all kinds of things. I\u0027m a slapstick guy.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022The campaign\u0027s spirit,\u0022 Block continued, \u0022is incredibly high.\u0022 According to Block, Cain had just had his best fundraising days ever, raising $1.6 million following the allegations. The Rasmussen poll and the Washington Post/ABC poll showed Cain right with Mitt Romney nationally, and ahead in a few key states. \u0022We\u0027re excited about our strategies,\u0022 said Block. \u0022We\u0027re kicking ass.\u0022 (Reached a few days later, after more women had come out against Cain, Block repeated this sentiment: \u0022The media cesspool just doesn\u0027t get it. We\u0027re still kicking ass.\u0022)\u000A\u000AI asked him if he wanted to be the next Karl Rove, as the Times story suggested—even after Rove criticized his response to the harassment allegations. \u0022Karl Rove spoke out months ago,\u0022 Block said, \u0022saying that Herman Cain shouldn\u0027t even be running for president. Probably a good thing that we didn\u0027t listen to him back then, either.\u0022\u000A\u000AStill, one of Block\u0027s favorite expressions sounds rather Rovian: \u0022Those that need to know, know.\u0022 Maybe Mark Block wasn\u0027t really lost in traffic on that cold afternoon in Atlanta. Maybe he was there for a reason. Maybe it was refuge. Or maybe it was part of his \u0022nontraditional strategy\u0022 in some other unknowable way. Herman Cain doesn\u0027t have the Republican nomination yet, but, these days, anything—from coronation to resignation—seems possible. Just look around in traffic. If you believe Mark Block, the man in the Chevy Blazer, I\u0027m sitting down with Herman Cain next week.",

ATLANTA, RUSH HOUR, TWO FRIDAYS AGO</strong></p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.2">I was stuck in traffic, on Peachtree Street, cursing Herman Cain. A lane was blocked off, and my path to the former CEO of Godfather&#x2019;s Pizza wasn&#x2019;t any clearer. I&#x2019;d been trying to track down Cain for weeks. A former Atlanta mayor, Jimmy Carter&#x2019;s grandson, and a member of Cain&#x2019;s church had been no help. I&#x2019;d tried a passel of connected conservative business people in Georgia, and they&#x2019;d shrugged, too. No one knew Cain, or had his number, or admitted it if they did. I just wanted to shoot the shit with him over a slice of pepperoni, or a scoop of black walnut&#x2014;his favorite!&#x2014;and see how many times he&#x2019;d say, in that exquisite baritone, <em>nine-nine-nine. </em>I wanted to immerse myself in his aura of certainty. But I&#x2019;d nearly given up. <em>Screw the ice cream and pizza</em>, I thought. <em>I&#x2019;m becoming lactose intolerant anyway.</em></p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.3">The sky was a bright blue, but the wind had a wintery edge to it. I looked around at my fellow captives caught in traffic. In front of me was a beat-up, red Chevy Blazer. It had two Herman Cain stickers on its rear window (&quot;Is America Ready for Herman Cain?&quot; asked one). No one here in the city where Herman Cain lives had two Herman Cain stickers two weeks ago&#x2014;or now, for that matter, after his surge in the polls. The odd Blazer had Wisconsin plates.</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.5">There was a man at the wheel and his window was down, his elbow resting on its sill. His hand reflexively ashed a cigarette and his face, forgettable yet familiar, flashed across the rearview mirror. He merged into the right lane, without signaling. I pulled ahead, on a hunch, and looked over: there were the cheap glasses, the graying mustache, the sallow skin and burdened jowls. He was looking down, intently, at his smartphone. Then he made a sudden right turn out of traffic; I pulled a dangerous U-turn, cut left, and followed. I had to follow. I knew that mustache.</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.6">The man pulled into a parking lot behind a gas station, just off Peachtree; I pulled into an empty driveway across the street, in a neighborhood called Sherwood Forest. Thirty seconds later, he was moving again, back towards Peachtree; so was I. Nearing the gridlock, we both stopped. I put my car in park, in the middle of the street, and got out. The man appeared unconcerned, even slightly amused, as I approached his Blazer in gym shorts. He lit another cigarette as I spoke:</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.7">&quot;Are you Mark Block, Herman Cain&#x2019;s chief of staff? The guy from the smoking ad?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.8">I&#x2019;d watched <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=qhm-22Q0PuM">the ad</a> a few days before&#x2014;forwarding it to friends, noting Cain&#x2019;s creepy, slowly evolving smile at the end, after Block&#x2019;s thrilling jump cut exhale&#x2014;and saw Block defend it on CNN the previous night. &quot;We&#x2019;ve run a campaign like nobody&#x2019;s ever seen,&quot; Block says in the ad, now viewed 1.5 million times on YouTube. &quot;But then, America&#x2019;s never seen a candidate like Herman Cain.&quot; I agreed then, as now.</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.9">The man took a long drag from his Marlboro Light. &quot;Yes I am. Did you like it, the ad?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.a">&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said. &quot;It&#x2019;s catchy. Look, I know this is weird, to approach you in traffic, but I&#x2019;m a journalist and I&#x2019;d like to interview you and, if possible, Mr. Cain.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.b">He took another drag, as we exchanged business cards. &quot;Sure. That can be arranged.&quot; He seemed sincere, without pretension or obvious guile. He read my card. Then he looked back at his phone, and said, without apparent concern: &quot;I&#x2019;m lost.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.c">We talked for a few minutes before cars finally moved, me standing beside his car where he sat and smoked. He was late to a Cain event, working on four hours of sleep. He spends one day a week at campaign headquarters in Stockbridge, Georgia, and travels the rest. Wisconsin is his home, where his family lives, where he was elected to the Winnebago County Board of Supervisors when he was a clean-lunged eighteen-year-old with long hair&#x2014;&quot;but not a hippie&quot;&#x2014;hoping to &quot;make a difference.&quot; His hair was short, graying and formless by 2005, when he returned to practicing politics after a three-year ban in Wisconsin, for election improprieties. It remained that way in the Blazer, in traffic, days before the breaking of the sexual harassment allegations against Herman Cain, and the seemingly haphazard explanations, from Cain and Block, that still follow.</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.d">The chief of one of the strangest campaigns in presidential history finally had to go. Traffic was moving. He put the Blazer in gear and told me to be in touch. I drove home, in my gym shorts, with his card in my hand. He continued down Peachtree, wearing that mustache, trying to find his way. He hadn&#x2019;t asked for help.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.e"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>SCENE TWO: WASHINGTON D.C., WASHINGTON CONVENTION CENTER, 1:50 P.M., LAST FRIDAY</strong></p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.g">He shouted my name into the phone, over the din of a crowd, like we were old friends. He was backstage at the &#x2019;Defending the American Dream Summit,&#x2019; put on by Americans for Prosperity. He was waiting for &quot;the boss&quot; to deliver a rousing twenty-minute speech that would celebrate free markets and limited government. It would &quot;kick ass,&quot; he said. &quot;Hear that sound? They can&#x2019;t wait.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.h">Mark Block had dealt with a lot in the intervening week, including allegations that Cain sexually harassed at least four women some years ago; the home court clapping was a relief. Block was very upbeat, in a buzzed sort of way. He said he hadn&#x2019;t and wouldn&#x2019;t read the <em>New York Times</em> story, &quot;For a Close Aide to Herman Cain, Scrutiny Comes on Two Fronts,&quot; which came out that morning and was mostly about him. I mentioned that the article claimed, among other things, that he has no sense of humor. &quot;My goodness,&quot; he said. &quot;They must not have watched the smoking video. I laugh at all kinds of things. I&#x2019;m a slapstick guy.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.i"> &quot;The campaign&#x2019;s spirit,&quot; Block continued, &quot;is incredibly high.&quot; According to Block, Cain had just had his best fundraising days ever, raising $1.6 million following the allegations. The Rasmussen poll and the Washington Post/ABC poll showed Cain right with Mitt Romney nationally, and ahead in a few key states. &quot;We&#x2019;re excited about our strategies,&quot; said Block. &quot;We&#x2019;re kicking ass.&quot; (Reached a few days later, after more women had come out against Cain, Block repeated this sentiment: &quot;The media cesspool just doesn&#x2019;t get it. We&#x2019;re still kicking ass.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.j">I asked him if he wanted to be the next Karl Rove, as the <em>Times </em>story suggested&#x2014;even after Rove criticized his response to the harassment allegations. &quot;Karl Rove spoke out months ago,&quot; Block said, &quot;saying that Herman Cain shouldn&#x2019;t even be running for president. Probably a good thing that we didn&#x2019;t listen to him back then, either.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.4.k">Still, one of Block&#x2019;s favorite expressions sounds rather Rovian: &quot;Those that need to know, know.&quot; Maybe Mark Block wasn&#x2019;t really lost in traffic on that cold afternoon in Atlanta. Maybe he was there for a reason. Maybe it was refuge. Or maybe it was part of his &quot;nontraditional strategy&quot; in some other unknowable way. Herman Cain doesn&#x2019;t have the Republican nomination yet, but, these days, anything&#x2014;from coronation to resignation&#x2014;seems possible. Just look around in traffic. If you believe Mark Block, the man in the Chevy Blazer, I&#x2019;m sitting down with Herman Cain next week.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".hq5574ka2o.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
