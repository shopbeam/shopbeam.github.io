  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADES MOINES, IOWA &amp;#x2013; Since the end of the 2012 presidential campaign, we political reporters who\u0027ve now and again trailed the various 2016 presidential wannabes out to Iowa have done so with a certain amount of sheepishness, if not shame. Covering a campaign years before the actual election is enough to make a journalist feel embarrassed, if you can believe it. \u0022It\u0027s like seeing your friend from church at the strip club,\u0022 a fellow schlepper joked to me when we bumped into each other in the lobby of the Des Moines Marriott two summers ago while following around Ted Cruz. And to be sure, years worth of overheated, speculation-drenched coverage is more harmful to our democracy than mere lap dances. But this weekend, the Marriott was a guilt-free zone and a scene that maybe even Alexis de Tocqueville could have appreciated. Dozens of reporters from Washington and New York schmoozed and drank at the hotel bar unburdened by any self-consciousness. The Marriott felt like Caucus eve. Coming to Iowa was socially and journalistically acceptable again.\u000A\u000AThe traveling swarm of political reporters were in Des Moines for the \u0022Iowa Freedom Summit,\u0022 Saturday\u0027s ten-hour marathon of speechifying and gripping-and-grinning that served as the unofficial kickoff of the Republican presidential primary process. The brainchild of archconservative Iowa Congressman Steve King—who often utilizes his intellect to bemoan illegal immigration, declaring for instance that children of undocumented immigrants are typically marijuana smugglers with \u0022calves the size of cantaloupes\u0022—the Freedom Summit was catnip for about 1,200 of Iowa\u0027s hard-core conservative activists, who began lining up outside the historic theater hosting the summit before dawn. That naturally meant it was also catnip for the Republican presidential candidates who want to be loved by those hard-core activists—voters and volunteers, who, because of Iowa\u0027s first-in-the-nation caucus, wield a disproportionate amount of power in propelling or stalling White House contenders. And because this is Iowa, these activists are especially excited by the far right wing ideas and candidates.\u000A\u000AWhile most of the oxygen in the 2016 conversation has been consumed in recent weeks by the battle Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney are waging for the mantle of Establishment frontrunner, the far more interesting battle could be over who gets to be the conservative insurgent—the GOP candidate who harnesses the grassroots\u0027 revulsion at Washington and even Republican party leaders. That\u0027s not just because the field of conservative candidates is unusually large this time around; it\u0027s also because, in at least two instances, it\u0027s unusually talented. Also, let\u0027s be honest: If you had the choice between spending your Saturday listening to Mitt and Jeb earnestly talk about poverty and education reform or Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz (not to mention Donald Trump and Sarah Palin) demagogue on illegal immigration and Common Core, what would you choose?\u000A\u000AGranted, Bush and Romney—who both declined invitations to speak at the Summit, citing previous commitments—weren\u0027t far from people\u0027s thoughts in Iowa, as the two served as useful punching bags. When Trump, who despite the fact that he almost certainly won\u0027t run nonetheless had a presidential-sized entourage of aides and security guards and who stayed in the Marriott\u0027s presidential suite, told the crowd that the party\u0027s nominee \u0022can\u0027t be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed,\u0022 they roared. And when he told them that \u0022the last thing we need is another Bush,\u0022 they roared even louder.\u000A\u000AAnd it didn\u0027t go that much better for the one Establishment candidate who did show up: Chris Christie. Knowing his audience, Christie emphasized his pro-life credentials and he told the moving story of his mother saying to him on her death bed that \u0022there is nothing left unsaid between us,\u0022 as a way of explaining his own penchant for blunt talk. But Christie, who\u0027s desperate to convince people he\u0027s got his groove back after the trials and tribulations of Bridgegate, was unusually subdued and exhibited little of that bluntness himself, as if he feared that his act—the trash-talking tough guy with a moderate heart—wouldn\u0027t play in Iowa. Even when an immigration protestor interrupted his speech, Christie brushed it off. \u0022Don\u0027t they know I am from New Jersey?\u0022 he asked. \u0022This doesn\u0027t bother me one bit.\u0022 Maybe, but back in Jersey, Christie would have at least told the guy to \u0022sit down and shut up,\u0022 if not something worse. Christie\u0027s main message to conservatives in Iowa was that he wasn\u0027t so different from them, after all, and that their disagreements, on everything from judicial nominations to gun control, were ultimately not that big a deal. \u0022If you want a candidate who agrees with you 100 percent of the time,\u0022 Christie said, \u0022go home and look in the mirror.\u0022 Judging by the empty seats and the subdued applause he received, some of the activists planned to do just that.\u000A\u000AOr they could simply look at some of the other, more ideologically simpatico presidential candidates who had assembled in Des Moines. Although Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, the winners of the last two Iowa Caucuses, felt a bit stale with their speeches, the newer faces struck a chord. Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and Tea Party darling, gave a TED Talk-like speech that drew heavily on his inspirational, made-for-TV personal narrative and showed that he has the potential to be a more serious player than past presidential longshots. Meanwhile, Carly Fiorina, the fired Hewlett-Packard CEO and failed California Senate candidate, gave a Hillary-bashing speech—\u0022Like Hillary Clinton, I too have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe,\u0022 Fiorina taunted, \u0022but unlike her, I have actually accomplished something\u0022—that made her incipient presidential campaign marginally less ludicrous\u000A\u000AThe two biggest stars of King\u0027s gathering were Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Walker has endeared himself to conservatives in recent years and become a target for national liberal groups that have tried to take him out—first in a recall campaign and then in this past election—for cutting the collective-bargaining rights of public sector unions. \u0022One of the things that I love about this next speaker,\u0022 the summit\u0027s co-host, Citizens United president David Bossie, said in introducing Walker, \u0022is how completely crazy he drives the liberal left.\u0022 The problem for Walker is that he hasn\u0027t necessarily been able to rouse similarly passionate feelings among his conservative supporters. At times, he can make Tim Pawlenty seem exciting.\u000A\u000AIn Iowa, however, a newer, more fiery Walker emerged. Pacing the stage in rolled-up shirtsleeves, he dwelled on the personal toll of his political battles in Wisconsin, describing in detail the death threats he says he and his family received from angry liberals. \u0022Someone literally sent me a threat saying they were going to gut my wife like a deer,\u0022 Walker said. And he repeatedly touted his willingness \u0022to go big and go bold\u0022 as governor, mentioning not just his union-busting efforts, but also his defunding of Planned Parenthood, expansion of gun rights, and implementation of a strict Voter ID law. \u0022If you\u0027re not afraid to go big and bold,\u0022 Walker said, \u0022you can actually get results.\u0022\u000A\u000ACruz doesn\u0027t have a record of results like Walker\u0027s. He has no legislative accomplishments to his name and his two years in the Senate have been marked by futile—and sometimes counter-productive—efforts. But while these have made him the most hated man in Washington, loathed even by many of his fellow Senate Republicans, they\u0027ve turned him into a hero outside the Beltway. There, Cruz has been able to recast his kamikaze campaigns as courageous and principled stands. \u0022In a Republican primary, every candidate\u0027s going to come before you and say, \u0027I\u0027m the most conservative guy who ever lived,\u0027\u0022 Cruz told the crowd in Des Moines. \u0022You know what, talk is cheap. The Word tells us you shall know them by their fruits. . . . If you say you support liberty, show me where you stood up and fought for it.\u0022\u000A\u000AAt the end of the event, which had the feel at times of an NFL draft combine, GOP pollster Frank Luntz declared Cruz the top prospect. \u0022Watching him, watching the faces of people watching him, he lit this place up, he connects with these people\u0022 Luntz told me. Then he added, \u0022But don\u0027t forget, Iowa isn\u0027t New Hampshire.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhich is true. Traditionally, the conservative alternative has to do well, if not outright win, in Iowa, before he gets ground down to nothing by the more moderate sensibilities (and deeper pockets) of the GOP Establishment in New Hampshire and other states. But, after watching them this past weekend, Walker and Cruz both seem like they could pose more formidable challenges to the Establishment. Walker has a gubernatorial record that\u0027s fresher than Bush\u0027s and Romney\u0027s and more accomplished than Christie\u0027s, while Cruz has the native political talent of Christie and the intellectual dexterity of Bush. In other words, they both offer qualities that were lacking in previous candidates beloved by the right wing of the party, like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum (both of whom gave performances that paled in comparison to Cruz\u0027s and Walker\u0027s at the Summit). And when you consider how much of a scare those two conservative alternatives put into the Establishment in 2008 and 2012, it\u0027s easy to imagine Walker or Cruz being downright terrifying in 2016. In recent years, Iowa has been a sideshow—so much so that some Republicans wish it would go away. But if the Summit proved anything, it\u0027s that a couple of the guys who need to do well in Iowa might have the chops to succeed outside of it as well.\u000A\u000AJason Zengerle is a GQ correspondent.",

&amp;#x2013; Since the end of the 2012 presidential campaign, we political reporters who&#x2019;ve now and again trailed the various 2016 presidential wannabes out to Iowa have done so with a certain amount of sheepishness, if not shame. Covering a campaign years before the actual election is enough to make a journalist feel embarrassed, if you can believe it. &quot;It&#x2019;s like seeing your friend from church at the strip club,&quot; a fellow schlepper joked to me when we bumped into each other in the lobby of the Des Moines Marriott two summers ago while following around Ted Cruz. And to be sure, years worth of overheated, speculation-drenched coverage is more harmful to our democracy than mere lap dances. But this weekend, the Marriott was a guilt-free zone and a scene that maybe even Alexis de Tocqueville could have appreciated. Dozens of reporters from Washington and New York schmoozed and drank at the hotel bar unburdened by any self-consciousness. The Marriott felt like Caucus eve. Coming to Iowa was socially and journalistically acceptable again.</p><p data-reactid=".2gkzu4q0nb4.1.1.0.0.4.2">The traveling swarm of political reporters were in Des Moines for the &quot;Iowa Freedom Summit,&quot; Saturday&#x2019;s ten-hour marathon of speechifying and gripping-and-grinning that served as the unofficial kickoff of the Republican presidential primary process. The brainchild of archconservative Iowa Congressman Steve King&#x2014;who often utilizes his intellect to bemoan illegal immigration, declaring for instance that children of undocumented immigrants are typically marijuana smugglers with &quot;calves the size of cantaloupes&quot;&#x2014;the Freedom Summit was catnip for about 1,200 of Iowa&#x2019;s hard-core conservative activists, who began lining up outside the historic theater hosting the summit before dawn. That naturally meant it was also catnip for the Republican presidential candidates who want to be loved by those hard-core activists&#x2014;voters and volunteers, who, because of Iowa&#x2019;s first-in-the-nation caucus, wield a disproportionate amount of power in propelling or stalling White House contenders. And because this is Iowa, these activists are especially excited by the far right wing ideas and candidates.</p><p data-reactid=".2gkzu4q0nb4.1.1.0.0.4.3">While most of the oxygen in the 2016 conversation has been consumed in recent weeks by the battle Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney are waging for the mantle of Establishment frontrunner, the far more interesting battle could be over who gets to be the conservative insurgent&#x2014;the GOP candidate who harnesses the grassroots&#x2019; revulsion at Washington and even Republican party leaders. That&#x2019;s not just because the field of conservative candidates is unusually large this time around; it&#x2019;s also because, in at least two instances, it&#x2019;s unusually talented. Also, let&#x2019;s be honest: If you had the choice between spending your Saturday listening to Mitt and Jeb earnestly talk about poverty and education reform or Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz (not to mention Donald Trump and Sarah Palin) demagogue on illegal immigration and Common Core, what would you choose?</p><p data-reactid=".2gkzu4q0nb4.1.1.0.0.4.5">Granted, Bush and Romney&#x2014;who both declined invitations to speak at the Summit, citing previous commitments&#x2014;weren&#x2019;t far from people&#x2019;s thoughts in Iowa, as the two served as useful punching bags. When Trump, who despite the fact that he almost certainly won&#x2019;t run nonetheless had a presidential-sized entourage of aides and security guards and who stayed in the Marriott&#x2019;s presidential suite, told the crowd that the party&#x2019;s nominee &quot;can&#x2019;t be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed,&quot; they roared. And when he told them that &quot;the last thing we need is another Bush,&quot; they roared even louder.</p><p data-reactid=".2gkzu4q0nb4.1.1.0.0.4.6">And it didn&#x2019;t go that much better for the one Establishment candidate who did show up: Chris Christie. Knowing his audience, Christie emphasized his pro-life credentials and he told the moving story of his mother saying to him on her death bed that &quot;there is nothing left unsaid between us,&quot; as a way of explaining his own penchant for blunt talk. But Christie, who&#x2019;s desperate to convince people he&#x2019;s got his groove back after the trials and tribulations of Bridgegate, was unusually subdued and exhibited little of that bluntness himself, as if he feared that his act&#x2014;the trash-talking tough guy with a moderate heart&#x2014;wouldn&#x2019;t play in Iowa. Even when an immigration protestor interrupted his speech, Christie brushed it off. &quot;Don&#x2019;t they know I am from New Jersey?&quot; he asked. &quot;This doesn&#x2019;t bother me one bit.&quot; Maybe, but back in Jersey, Christie would have at least told the guy to &quot;sit down and shut up,&quot; if not something worse. Christie&#x2019;s main message to conservatives in Iowa was that he wasn&#x2019;t so different from them, after all, and that their disagreements, on everything from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/bench-memos/385231/yes-chris-christie-did-appoint-liberals-new-jersey-supreme-court-carrie-severino">judicial nominations</a> to gun control, were ultimately not that big a deal. &quot;If you want a candidate who agrees with you 100 percent of the time,&quot; Christie said, &quot;go home and look in the mirror.&quot; Judging by the empty seats and the subdued applause he received, some of the activists planned to do just that.</p><p data-reactid=".2gkzu4q0nb4.1.1.0.0.4.7">Or they could simply look at some of the other, more ideologically simpatico presidential candidates who had assembled in Des Moines. Although Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, the winners of the last two Iowa Caucuses, felt a bit stale with their speeches, the newer faces struck a chord. Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and Tea Party darling, gave a TED Talk-like speech that drew heavily on his inspirational, made-for-TV personal narrative and showed that he has the potential to be a more serious player than past presidential longshots. Meanwhile, Carly Fiorina, the fired Hewlett-Packard CEO and failed California Senate candidate, gave a Hillary-bashing speech&#x2014;&quot;Like Hillary Clinton, I too have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe,&quot; Fiorina taunted, &quot;but unlike her, I have actually accomplished something&quot;&#x2014;that made her incipient presidential campaign marginally less ludicrous</p><p data-reactid=".2gkzu4q0nb4.1.1.0.0.4.8">The two biggest stars of King&#x2019;s gathering were Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Walker has endeared himself to conservatives in recent years and become a target for national liberal groups that have tried to take him out&#x2014;first in a recall campaign and then in this past election&#x2014;for cutting the collective-bargaining rights of public sector unions. &quot;One of the things that I love about this next speaker,&quot; the summit&#x2019;s co-host, Citizens United president David Bossie, said in introducing Walker, &quot;is how completely crazy he drives the liberal left.&quot; The problem for Walker is that he hasn&#x2019;t necessarily been able to rouse similarly passionate feelings among his conservative supporters. At times, he can make Tim Pawlenty seem exciting.</p><p data-reactid=".2gkzu4q0nb4.1.1.0.0.4.9">In Iowa, however, a newer, more fiery Walker emerged. Pacing the stage in rolled-up shirtsleeves, he dwelled on the personal toll of his political battles in Wisconsin, describing in detail the death threats he says he and his family received from angry liberals. &quot;Someone literally sent me a threat saying they were going to gut my wife like a deer,&quot; Walker said. And he repeatedly touted his willingness &quot;to go big and go bold&quot; as governor, mentioning not just his union-busting efforts, but also his defunding of Planned Parenthood, expansion of gun rights, and implementation of a strict Voter ID law. &quot;If you&#x2019;re not afraid to go big and bold,&quot; Walker said, &quot;you can actually get results.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gkzu4q0nb4.1.1.0.0.4.a">Cruz doesn&#x2019;t have a record of results like Walker&#x2019;s. He has no legislative accomplishments to his name and his two years in the Senate have been marked by <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/ted-cruz-blast">futile</a>&#x2014;and sometimes <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/ted_cruz_and_mike_lee_helped_appoint_obama_surgeon_general_the_conservative.html">counter-productive</a>&#x2014;efforts. But while these have made him the <a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201310/ted-cruz-republican-senator-october-2013">most hated man in Washington</a>, loathed even by many of his fellow Senate Republicans, they&#x2019;ve turned him into a hero outside the Beltway. There, Cruz has been able to recast his kamikaze campaigns as courageous and principled stands. &quot;In a Republican primary, every candidate&#x2019;s going to come before you and say, &#x2019;I&#x2019;m the most conservative guy who ever lived,&#x2019;&quot; Cruz told the crowd in Des Moines. &quot;You know what, talk is cheap. The Word tells us you shall know them by their fruits. . . . If you say you support liberty, show me where you stood up and fought for it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gkzu4q0nb4.1.1.0.0.4.b">At the end of the event, which had the feel at times of an NFL draft combine, GOP pollster Frank Luntz declared Cruz the top prospect. &quot;Watching him, watching the faces of people watching him, he lit this place up, he connects with these people&quot; Luntz told me. Then he added, &quot;But don&#x2019;t forget, Iowa isn&#x2019;t New Hampshire.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gkzu4q0nb4.1.1.0.0.4.c">Which is true. Traditionally, the conservative alternative has to do well, if not outright win, in Iowa, before he gets ground down to nothing by the more moderate sensibilities (and deeper pockets) of the GOP Establishment in New Hampshire and other states. But, after watching them this past weekend, Walker and Cruz both seem like they could pose more formidable challenges to the Establishment. Walker has a gubernatorial record that&#x2019;s fresher than Bush&#x2019;s and Romney&#x2019;s and more accomplished than Christie&#x2019;s, while Cruz has the native political talent of Christie and the intellectual dexterity of Bush. In other words, they both offer qualities that were lacking in previous candidates beloved by the right wing of the party, like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum (both of whom gave performances that paled in comparison to Cruz&#x2019;s and Walker&#x2019;s at the Summit). And when you consider how much of a scare those two conservative alternatives put into the Establishment in 2008 and 2012, it&#x2019;s easy to imagine Walker or Cruz being downright terrifying in 2016. In recent years, Iowa has been a sideshow&#x2014;so much so that some Republicans wish it would go away. But if the Summit proved anything, it&#x2019;s that a couple of the guys who need to do well in Iowa might have the chops to succeed outside of it as well.</p><p
