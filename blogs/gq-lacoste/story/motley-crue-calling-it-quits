There was a big church get-together, and she took my albums. And I\u0027d worked for them.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022And they burned them at the church?\u0022 I ask her.\u000A\u000A\u0022They had a big bonfire, yeah. That destroyed my life. I hated my mom.\u0022__\u000A\u000ANo one will say whose idea the suicide pact was. Nikki Sixx says he can\u0027t remember. Tommy Lee can\u0027t remember. Mick Mars can\u0027t remember. And Vince Neil definitely can\u0027t remember. Now, they\u0027re probably lying about this collective memory block, given that they\u0027ve all got a similar rehearsed answer for why this is the end—something about not wanting to be out on tour in a decade with none of the group\u0027s original members. \u0022Like Guns N\u0027 Roses,\u0022 Vince tells me. \u0022There\u0027s only one guy left in the band.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut let\u0027s go ahead and take them at their word, because this is M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e, and when you spend thirty-three years in one of the most celebrated, sex-crazed, drug-addled metal bands of the 1980s, you\u0027re going to forget more decadence and lunacy than lesser men will experience in a lifetime. Let\u0027s focus instead on the fact that they signed a contract—they should\u0027ve signed it in blood for an added flourish—and the contract stipulates that after this tour, none of them can play a show under the name M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e ever again. Of course, \u0022this tour\u0022 began last summer and runs until the end of 2015. And of course, musicians are the only people worse than pro athletes at staying retired. But let\u0027s take the contract at face value, because these men are no strangers to litigation—they\u0027ve pretty much all sued one another at some point—and because it\u0027s more fun to pretend that this really is the end, and that the end didn\u0027t actually come, for them and for all of us, a long time ago. The groupies are all married now. They all brought someone tonight to go home with.\u000A\u000ASo: I\u0027m gonna act as if this is the end, and you are, too. So come now, children of the beast. Come in your leather miniskirts and your halter tops. Come in your slitted dresses and your ripped jeans and your stiletto heels. Come in your white jean jackets and your studded bracelets and ratty Overkill T-shirts. Tonight you will see flames—clouds of flames. Tonight you will see dancers in latex nurses\u0027 outfits and fuck-me stockings prancing across the stage. Tonight you will hear very loud guitars connected to very big rows of speakers that will hang from the ceiling, curving and draping like bandoliers across the body of a fearsome demon soldier. Tonight you will sip from guitar-shaped rum runners that cost more than your mortgage. Tonight you will forget what year it is, and you will raise your fist and shout at the Devil one last (maybe?) time. Because tonight is the end, and the end means death and hell and fire—FIAHHHHHHH!!!—and that is fucking rock \u0027n\u0027 roll, and this is M&amp;#xF6;tley fucking Cr&amp;#xFC;e.\u000A\u000AAlso there\u0027s gonna be a roller coaster.\u000A\u000AI\u0027m drinking Modelos in the parking lot with Michelle and Scott. I ask Michelle who her favorite band member is.\u000A\u000A\u0022Tommy,\u0022 she says. \u0022He stayed the skinniest.\u0022\u000A\u000AHer husband corrects her. \u0022It\u0027s because he\u0027s got a dick to his knees—come on.\u0022 He puts his hand at his knee to indicate the length of that dick. You know you\u0027ve made it when strangers talk about your dick when you\u0027re not even there.\u000A\u000A\u0022Is he right?\u0022 I ask Michelle.\u000A\u000AShe smiles. \u0022Abso-fucking-lutely.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ATommy\u000A\u000ARight now, the roller coaster—a.k.a. the Cr&amp;#xFC;ecifly—is a disaster. We\u0027re at Cedar Park Center way outside Austin, where the city\u0027s Republicans shelter themselves from the liberal food-truck hippies and the hook-\u0027em-horns college kids downtown, and it turns out the ceiling of this joint can\u0027t support Tommy Lee\u0027s drum setup. Tommy has played drums in every conceivable position—upside down, sideways, naked, under warrant—and now he would like to play drums on a fully functional roller coaster that hurtles him out over the crowd.\u000A\u000A\u0022People expect more each time,\u0022 Tommy tells me. \u0022So it\u0027s just been this constant \u0027Okay, fuck, what\u0027s the next level?\u0027 shit. How can we make people walk out of there going, \u0027What the fuck?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ABut it turns out not every venue on this tour can support a spontaneous drummer-coaster. Dozens of crew members are out here trying to figure out how much of the Cr&amp;#xFC;ecifly they can build. For the moment, it lies in pieces on the arena floor, like sections of track from a toy-train set—huge curving steel beams stacked up on massive rolling dollies. So much literal heavy metal. M&amp;#xF6;tley refuses to make things easy, even at the very end. When I ask their longtime manager, Allen Kovac, if the band has stabilized in recent years, he quickly replies, \u0022Onstage, absolutely. Business-wise, nightmare.\u0022\u000A\u000AMeanwhile, Tommy is holed up in his bus, planning this evening\u0027s solo. It\u0027s a really nice bus, with granite countertops and tasteful wood paneling; I want to busjack it and drive it to Mexico. Tommy still dresses and talks like a 19-year-old SoCal bro. He\u0027s got the tats, and he\u0027s rocking a black baseball cap on top of a black bandanna, and somewhere buried beneath all of it is his head. He\u0027s as skinny as ever. He looks like one big stretched tendon. But he\u0027s 52 now, and his face is more severe.\u000A\u000A\u0022I still question some of the venues that we\u0027re playing,\u0022 he says, grumbling about arenas on the tour that cannot handle the Cr&amp;#xFC;ecifly. \u0022I\u0027m like, who the fuck booked this show at Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles in our hometown? There\u0027s no roof on the fuckin\u0027 place.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhy stop touring now, when you could just tour every summer and stockpile cash? I ask him.\u000A\u000A\u0022I feel like we\u0027ve done everything we came here to fuckin\u0027 do. People from financial people to business people, friends, family, are going, \u0027Are you guys out of your fucking mind? The fucking Stones are still doing this shit. Just fucking do it less often or whatever. You\u0027re fucking idiots.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ATommy\u0027s engaged now. He\u0027s been married three times already—once to model Elaine Bergen, once to Heather Locklear, once to Pam Anderson—but this new future bride, Sofi, is different. She\u0027s not famous. She\u0027s Greek, like Tommy. She\u0027s normal. And after all those years in M&amp;#xF6;tley, Tommy craves normal. Sofi is here on the bus right now, hanging in the back. I\u0027m pretty sure she can hear us talking.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ve been in some fucking crazy relationships that maybe weren\u0027t the most healthy for the parties involved,\u0022 he says. \u0022Sofi\u0027s my fucking rock. It\u0027s like, Fuck, I wish I would have fucking met you so many years ago. You know? I felt just like, \u0027Man, that is the coolest chick. I want to be her buddy.\u0027 Not even ever thinking, \u0027Oh man, I\u0027ve gotta fucking hit this.\u0027 Not even that.\u0022\u000A\u000AAlas, the full Cr&amp;#xFC;ecifly cannot be built for tonight\u0027s show. Instead, Austin will get the Cobra: similar to the original coaster, but circumcised a bit at the tip. Tommy\u0027s kit, with every last piece bolted down to a steel disc the size of a pitcher\u0027s mound, barely fits through the loading door. In a few hours, he\u0027ll be strapped into it and lifted thirty feet in the air, spinning in circles and praying that the ceiling doesn\u0027t cave in.\u000A\u000APaul and his brother are shitfaced in the concourse. A woman walks by in tight jeans, and the brothers make no effort to disguise their ogling.\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s really what the Cr&amp;#xFC;e is, right?\u0022 Paul says. \u0022This band\u0027s been around for thirty years—they\u0027re still pulling women like that. Look how bad that bitch is. You\u0027re going to see more titties at this concert than you\u0027re going to see anywhere else. We followed the bouncing booty all the way here. That\u0027s how we got here. We just got out of our car and followed it, and it was all younger than me.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMick\u000A\u000A\u0022Can you hold my breasts for the photo?\u0022\u000A\u000AWe are in the back of the arena for a VIP meet and greet. Fans who have paid an ungodly sum of extra money get to shake hands and snap pictures with Vince, Mick, and Nikki. (Tommy doesn\u0027t do the meet and greets with fans. \u0022Philosophical issues,\u0022 Kovac says.) And now this lady with ample breasts has a special request for Nikki. Nikki is confused.\u000A\u000A\u0022You want me to sign them?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022No. Grab them.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh no—I can\u0027t do that.\u0022\u000A\u000AMick Mars, the eldest and most pragmatic member of M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e, is dressed in slim black jeans and a black denim vest. The jeans are meant to be skintight, but they hang off his body anyway, as if they\u0027re being worn by a ghost. His platform shoes make up for some of the height he\u0027s lost to ankylosing spondylitis, a spinal condition that has plagued him since he was a teenager. AS can cause all of your vertebrae to gradually fuse together, which in turn causes your body to stoop into a permanent curve; eventually it results in total immobility. I watch as Mick, hunched over, tries to find a comfortable position to stand in as he greets fans. He winds up leaning back against the wall, heels down, toes up, like a lamp that\u0027s been knocked over. One woman poses for a photo with the band and pulls Mick closer to her, oblivious to how much discomfort she\u0027s causing him. \u0022Don\u0027t be shy,\u0022 she coos.\u000A\u000ABack in his tour bus, which isn\u0027t as nice as Tommy\u0027s, Mick can sit down. One other consequence of his condition is that he can\u0027t open his mouth very wide, so he tends to talk through his teeth.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ve got this stupid AS crap,\u0022 he says, sounding more annoyed by the disease than existentially stricken by it. \u0022I got into the gargoyle look. In the late \u002790s and early 2000s, I kind of messed up and made myself a little worse.\u0022\u000A\u000AHow did you make it worse?\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022Opiates. You saw my posture. It\u0027s like I\u0027m carrying a forty-pound head. But people have really accepted it.\u0022\u000A\u000AHave you accepted that this is all coming to an end?\u000A\u000A\u0022I think that this band has probably given as much as it can to our fans and everything else. I mean, that doesn\u0027t mean that M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e itself, the entity or whatever you want to call it, is going to really stop. Let\u0027s use Jimi Hendrix, okay? He still has products coming out way after his death.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat may be true for M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e, but it won\u0027t necessarily be the case for its individual members. Kovac has warned all of them that they will never be as successful apart as they have been together, and a couple of them, he says, are having a hard time accepting this fact. \u0022If you look at Tommy\u0027s [solo] discography, he likes to experiment, whether it\u0027s hip-hop or pop or EDM,\u0022 Kovac says, \u0022and he has to come to the understanding, eventually, of whether or not the fans online agree.\u0022 The implication is that they do not. After this, there won\u0027t be another M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e, not for any of the guys, and not for us.\u000A\u000AI feel the loss myself. Rock music—rock music like M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e, anyway—is never coming back. Just saying that you like rock now, any rock, new or old, basically makes you a lame old man. The days are long gone when it lorded over the landscape with a cucumber stuffed down its leather pants. When I was in eighth grade, M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e represented all the things I wanted in life but wasn\u0027t allowed to have: all the cool drugs, the hot women, the houses on stilts in L.A.... I used to listen to Dr. Feelgood on a tape deck in my room, and I would lie on my bed thinking of every girl in school that I wanted to have sex with (all of them). In my head I would direct a video for \u0022Rattlesnake Shake\u0022 and pretend all the girls at school were strippers, and all of this seemed FEASIBLE because this is how your brain operates when you\u0027re in eighth grade. Rock was that pure want, rendered audible.\u000A\u000ANow it feels like rock exists strictly to make us nostalgic for that sort of feeling, not to actually live it out.\u000A\u000AA 300-pound programmer named William \u0022Viggy\u0022 Vignola has joined us on Mick\u0027s bus. He\u0027s been with the band a long time, and he\u0027s explaining to me exactly how things have changed. And even though the old rock \u0027n\u0027 roll culture nearly killed him, he doesn\u0027t seem happy that it\u0027s gone.\u000A\u000A\u0022Ever since Pearl Jam, girls weren\u0027t welcome on the bus,\u0022 he says. \u0022Back in the day, you had to earn your way onto tour buses.\u0022\u000A\u000AHow did Pearl Jam ruin it?\u000A\u000A\u0022They were the first ones to go [to the groupies], \u0027Hey, I just wanna talk.\u0027 It harshed it. It put this black cloud over it. And the Internet just killed everything. The Internet killed the mystique.\u0022\u000A\u000AViggy, a recovering alcoholic, spent eight years living with Tommy, trying to get him to stay dry. One year, as a kind of bonus, Tommy \u0022gave\u0022 him four porn stars.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027d you do with the porn stars?\u000A\u000A\u0022They were porno stars. We didn\u0027t play fucking backgammon.\u0022\u000A\u000AI would have been intimidated.\u000A\u000A\u0022I was freaked-out. You go through four stages. The first stage that you go through is, Holy shit, a porno star! Then you go, Ohmigod...a porno star.... And then you go, Am I doing this right? And then you go, Fuckin\u0027 porno star!\u0022\u000A\u000AViggy shows me the tattoo on his enormous left calf: IT DOESN\u0027T SUCK WORKING FOR TOMMY LEE.\u000A\u000AThere will be no porno stars here outside tonight. There probably won\u0027t be any opiates. It won\u0027t be especially decadent, not like it used to be. The memory of mayhem—that sense that a Roman orgy might break out at any moment—will have to be enough.\u000A\u000A\u0022Stand back a little from the stage,\u0022 Mick warns me. \u0022It gets pretty warm up there.\u0022\u000A\u000ALisa and her husband, Juan, are sitting in golf chairs out in the parking lot, drinking beer and blasting classic metal from their car. Lisa is wearing a black shirt and black pants. A full-body skeleton runs all the way down the outfit. By day she\u0027s an X-ray technician, so the outfit is like her little inside joke. \u0022You wanna see my coccyx?\u0022 she asks with a laugh.\u000A\u000ANeither of them believes this is really the end of the band. \u0022They\u0027ll figure out a way out of the contract,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000A\u0022Would you be upset if you never saw them again?\u0022 I ask. Juan just shrugs. \u0022Why not?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A\u0022\u0027Cos I\u0027ve gotta sing Vince Neil\u0027s fucking lyrics for him,\u0022 he says. Vince, it seems, has developed a rep for letting the crowd sing the choruses. \u0022Don\u0027t be slacking, you fucker.\u0022\u000A\u000AVINCE\u000A\u000AVince looks bored. This could be due to the fact that he\u0027s being interviewed for the billionth time. Or it might be because he\u0027s tired from the demands of this tour. Or it might just be his face, which is puer now and pretty heavily Botod. He probably could manage a facial expression, but it doesn\u0027t seem like he wants to. Vince seems to be at an emotional remove from pretty much everything. His watch is as big as a dinner plate. I bet he checks it a lot.\u000A\u000A\u0022I tour all the time when M&amp;#xF6;tley doesn\u0027t tour,\u0022 he tells me. \u0022So it\u0027s not going to be really any different. It was a good run.\u0022\u000A\u000AAre you a happier person now than when the band was in its heyday?\u000A\u000A\u0022I think this is our heyday.\u0022\u000A\u000ASorry. Does being out on tour with the band one last time excite you?\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s just that we\u0027ve been every place over and over again. People go, \u0027Wow, man, you\u0027re playing in Paris. What\u0027s it like?\u0027 \u0027Well, they have an Eiffel Tower, but so does Vegas,\u0027 you know?\u0022\u000A\u000AVince is eager to get onto the next thing. Things. He\u0027s an entrepreneur now. He\u0027s the majority owner of an arena-league football team, the Las Vegas Outlaws, and he has an exotic-car dealership in Vegas as well. And then there\u0027s his new burger franchise.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s called Quickee Burgers,\u0022 he says. \u0022And it\u0027ll be just, like, a kiosk, and it\u0027s only $5, and you only get a burger, fries, and a Coke—$5. That\u0027s it. You just get those three things.\u0022\u000A\u000AOkay.\u000A\u000A\u0022There\u0027s no double burgers; there\u0027s no triple burgers. You don\u0027t have a choice. But it\u0027s going to be pretty successful. It\u0027s a cool idea.\u0022\u000A\u000AOkay.\u000A\u000A(Later on I mention Vince\u0027s ventures to Kovac, and he replies, a bit wearily, \u0022I\u0027ve always suggested that he get business partners.\u0022 Turns out Vince has done just that: Mike Tyson and Ian Ziering are investors as well.)\u000A\u000ABack in 1984, Vince went on a liquor run with drummer \u0022Razzle\u0022 Dingley from the band Hanoi Rocks. While drunk and driving well over the speed limit, Neil smashed his Pantera head-on into another car, killing Dingley and severely injuring one of the other car\u0027s passengers. Over howls of outrage, Vince served just twenty days in jail. In 1995, he lost his 4-year-old daughter to cancer, an illness that he believed was caused by a Boeing subsidiary named Rocketdyne allegedly dumping toxic waste near his home. He sued the companies for millions, but the lawsuit was thrown out when his lawyer, since disbarred by the state of California, failed to provide documents Boeing had requested for the case. Rocketdyne still exists, and these days Vince often has the look of a man who is just trying to occupy himself as all that death and destruction gets farther away. Everything is a shrug.\u000A\u000ADo you have any regrets about your time in the band?\u000A\u000A\u0022If you look backward, you just look at opportunities that you\u0027ve totally fucked up.\u0022\u000A\u000ADoes life feel more settled for you now?\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s the same. Same thing, different year.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnother merrily drunk married couple. I ask the wife who her favorite band member is.\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, Nikki Sixx,\u0022 she says, swooning. \u0022I\u0027d fuck the shit out of that man.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022That all right by you?\u0022 I ask her husband.\u000A\u000AHe just shrugs. \u0022I would watch.\u0022\u000A\u000ANIKKI\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ANikki Sixx still looks like Nikki Sixx. He\u0027s got the black hair shooting out in every direction. He\u0027s got a necklace with a tiny gun pendant hanging around his neck. He\u0027s got big thick hands, like you\u0027d see on a quarterback or a farmer. And he remains M&amp;#xF6;tley\u0027s chief songwriter and taskmaster, the man who conceived this whole band and muscled it into reality. He is the \u0022curator of the brand,\u0022 which has probably been a more challenging job than playing the bass, considering that M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e transitioned long ago from a rock band to a corporation with four board members. He\u0027s the smartest member of the band, Kovac says, \u0022by far. And I think they know that.\u0022 And if you talk to Nikki, it becomes clear that he knows it.\u000A\u000A\u0022I love M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e, but goddamn does it take a lot of my time up,\u0022 he says. \u0022It\u0027s like being an athlete: You can win Super Bowls, but in the end, you\u0027re going to be a quarterback standing on the field, and somebody\u0027s going to bust your fucking knee, and you\u0027re going to be lying in the middle of the field with 10 million people watching you while you can\u0027t get up. And that\u0027s a fact of life—but it\u0027s not going to be a fact of our life. We\u0027re going to win the Super Bowl, and we\u0027re going to fucking leave.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou guys never got much critical adoration. Do you still feel a bit like outcasts?\u000A\u000A\u0022I feel original.\u0022\u000A\u000ANikki used to be a pretty angry guy, and probably still is. As a child, he was abandoned by his father. When he was a teenager, he ran away from his mom by stabbing himself and then framing her for it, hoping the cops would arrest her and give him the chance to slip away. (The plan worked.) Not surprisingly, his family issues wound up fueling a lengthy history of addiction, along with a lengthy history of punching people in the face. I ask him when his last fistfight was, and he says it was only a couple of tours ago. This is why I refrain from asking him if his hair is real.\u000A\u000A\u0022I have an issue with respect. The animal still breathes in there. And I don\u0027t know... I try to calm those flames.\u0022\u000A\u000ADo you fear it?\u000A\u000A\u0022I kind of like that it\u0027s there, you know?\u0022\u000A\u000ADo you think the band would have survived if it had started today?\u000A\u000A\u0022No. We\u0027ve often asked each other, What would we do with social media? And the truth is, what we would do is get ourselves arrested. Tommy and I were talking about it: \u0027Remember when we used to do cocaine and fuck all these girls?\u0027 And we would be in these small towns and all a cop had to do was kick the door in and they would have had themselves a drug arrest.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe irony here is that by the time Nirvana broke in the early 1990s, M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e had become the bad guys. They were your high school bully\u0027s favorite provider of corporatized cock rock. And today they\u0027re more of a sleek business enterprise than a rock band. At their shows, you can buy a devil-horn light-up stick for $15. No one\u0027s biting the heads off live bats anymore. The danger comes pre-packaged.\u000A\u000AI saw a woman in the VIP section, and she was telling me that her mom once burned her M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e records.\u000A\u000A\u0022That doesn\u0027t seem even possible now,\u0022 Nikki says. \u0022Is anybody going to burn a Mumford &amp; Sons record? I don\u0027t think so.\u0022\u000A\u000ABilly and Eric are a father-son combo, and both of them are rocking Mohawks. Billy sits on his dad\u0027s shoulders, wearing protective earmuffs. It looks like he\u0027s growing out of his dad\u0027s Mohawk.\u000A\u000A\u0022What\u0027s your favorite song?\u0022 I ask Eric.\u000A\u000A\u0022Tell him what your favorite song is,\u0022 says his dad. Eric hesitates. \u0022Quit being shy and blow it out,\u0022 Billy huffs. \u0022The one where they say \u0027ass.\u0027 Come on.\u0022\u000A\u000AEric giggles. \u0022 \u0027Kickstart My Heart.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AThe lights in the arena are going down. \u0022So Long, Farewell\u0022 from The Sound of Music starts blasting from the speakers, briefly perplexing the fans, then sending them into snorts of laughter.\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve moved backstage so I can watch the band prepare to walk out, and it must be said: Vince Neil\u0027s outfit is fucking ridiculous. There\u0027s a crucifix on his dick. Like, a little crucifix ad to the outside of his leather pants. It looks like an outfit Nikki designed for him as a cruel prank. \u0022Vince got more pussy, tenfold, than anyone else in the band,\u0022 Nikki told me earlier. \u0022Vince was the first one in the room who would go, \u0027I want her, her, and her.\u0027 And then me and Tommy would take the leftovers. Mick never wanted anything.\u0022 That kind of cocksmanship seems implausible with Vince in this getup. But hey, he\u0027d know how to attract women better than I would—maybe better than any of us. If a cross on his dick works, it works. Dick crosses for everyone.\u000A\u000AI\u0027m back out on the main floor of the arena now. Right before any band takes the stage, there\u0027s that WOOOOO!!! moment—where you scream and you feel your screams exploding out of every part of your face, ears included, as if the sound had been passed through a filter of thick static. I remember this from junior high. It feels good to have my face explode again.\u000A\u000AThe lights blast on, like someone flipped a switch on the sun, and we\u0027re off. M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e\u0027s list of classics is just long enough to fill a tidy two-hour performance, and they play every one of them. By the second song (\u0022Wild Side\u0022) Vince is in a groove, hitting the high notes and justifying his penis adornment. Everyone is shrieking. Fire shoots out from the stage on every big riff. I have failed to heed Mick\u0027s advice: The heat from the stage is searing.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHit after hit comes blasting out from Mick\u0027s fingers, which seem to be his only remaining functional appendages, as if he asked his illness to spare his hands and attack the rest of his body first. Throughout the arena, men slip behind their wives and girlfriends and grind into them. I see a bunch of dickhead guards roaming around and busting people for weed, and I wonder if those fans loved getting busted one last time. I see countless hot women in leather pants and clingy dresses standing next to stone-faced boyfriends who want to show off their girls but are dying to kick the shit out of you if you dare to ogle.\u000A\u000ADuring \u0022Shout at the Devil\u0022—the title track from the band\u0027s breakthrough 1983 album—Nikki busts out a specially designed bass that has been rigged to shoot flames twenty feet in the air. FLAME BASS. He shoots the fire at a hanging pentagram and the pentagram lights up. Your Southern Baptist momma would be so mad. I turn away from the stage to watch the crowd react, and I can see the rock in everyone\u0027s faces. I can see every last bit of irony scorched out of their expressions. All that\u0027s left is a look of pure, horny, hair-metal giddiness. SHOUT. SHOUT. SHOUT. SHOUT AT THE DEVILLLLLL!\u000A\u000A\u0022Fucking fire, man,\u0022 Vince says from the stage. Fucking fire, indeed. He pulls a girl up from the crowd and serenades her with \u0022Without You,\u0022 M&amp;#xF6;tley\u0027s dim-the-lights mega-hit ballad. (\u0022If you\u0027re about 25 years old and in the crowd tonight, it\u0027s probably because of this song,\u0022 he jokes. The crowd roars.) He whispers in the girl\u0027s ear, and even though there\u0027s no chance she can hear him with all the noise, she blushes anyway. Vince still has it.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s time for Tommy\u0027s climactic drum solo, and unlike every other wanky, self-indulgent drum solo by every other drummer, this one rivets the crowd. All the phones come out. The Cr&amp;#xFC;ecifly is busted—in fact, the band will soon add makeup dates to all the cities that didn\u0027t get the full coaster—but the Cobra still delivers, spinning Tommy around and thrusting him up to the ceiling and back down again as he beats the shit out of his kit. He plays electronic drums because he hits normal drums too hard.\u000A\u000ATommy spins and spins. And between the spinning and the pounding, he pauses for just a moment.\u000A\u000A\u0022PRETTY COOL, EH FUCKERS?!\u0022\u000A\u000AThree drunk women and one drunk guy are hanging out in the parking lot, trading conspiracy theories about whether Tommy Lee is really Tommy Lee.\u000A\u000A\u0022I saw him in Vegas,\u0022 says the man, \u0022and it was an impostor. It was definitely Nikki, and it was definitely Vince, but Mick Mars—you never know. It might have been a robot. I\u0027m pretty sure Mick Mars is dead.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou think Mick Mars is dead?\u000A\u000A\u0022Nikki Sixx is dead,\u0022 says one of the women.\u000A\u000AHer friend disagrees. \u0022Nikki\u0027s alive. Mick\u0027s dead.\u0022\u000A\u000AI tell them that I just interviewed Tommy before the show and he was very much alive.\u000A\u000A\u0022Can you just ask him to come out for a little bit,\u0022 the man asks me, \u0022just to get a BJ from some of my friends?\u0022\u000A\u000ANikki commands the audience to take a break and sit down. He wants to tell them M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e\u0027s origin story, about how they first got together in 1981 and vowed to conquer the world. He mentions new-wave music and the crowd boos lustily, because new wave sucked.\u000A\u000A\u0022I am so fucking grateful to stand up here with Tommy and Mick and Vince and still be alive, you know?\u0022 He will give this same speech tomorrow night in Dallas, and presumably every night for the rest of the tour. \u0022The music\u0027s going to live on,\u0022 he says, \u0022and we\u0027re going to stay in your fucking heads, and in your stereos, and in your fucking life!\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd he\u0027s right. Even if this is the final tour, M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e will still be around, as both a brand (ugh) and a memory. Nothing really ends, it just changes, all to prepare you for the biggest change of all, when your heart stops beating and you stop being human and you become something else, an angel or a devil or a pile of topsoil.\u000A\u000A\u0022We love you! Let\u0027s make some fucking noise!\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd back come the guitars. Back come \u0022Live Wire\u0022 and \u0022Girls, Girls, Girls\u0022 and \u0022Dr. Feelgood,\u0022 all dead in my memory for years until this moment, when they are resurrected and pumped full of warm blood. The band rips through \u0022Kickstart My Heart,\u0022 and every last remaining pound of TNT in the joint is detonated for the finale. Smoke envelopes the band. All you can see is their silhouettes through the fog. You can\u0027t see old or young. You can\u0027t see relevance. You can\u0027t see 2014 or 1981. The speakers are still buzzing with feedback and everyone is screaming and my ears are ringing and I wouldn\u0027t mind if we all just froze here and stayed like this forever, because this is fun.\u000A\u000ABut then, through the din, I hear Tommy: \u0022We\u0027re gonna miss you fuckers.\u0022 And that\u0027s it. That\u0027s the end. They\u0027re gone forever.\u000A\u000AAnd then five minutes later they all come back out again.\u000A\u000ADREW MAGARY (@drewmagary) is a GQ correspondent and a staff writer for Deadspin.",

Kiss albums, my M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e albums, my Judas Priest albums. There was a big church get-together, and she took my albums. And I&#x2019;d worked for them.&quot;</strong></em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong><em>&quot;And they burned them at the church?&quot; I ask her.</em></strong></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong><em>&quot;They had a big bonfire, yeah. That destroyed my life. I hated my mom.&quot;</em></strong>__</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.6">No one will say whose idea the suicide pact was. Nikki Sixx says he can&#x2019;t remember. Tommy Lee can&#x2019;t remember. Mick Mars can&#x2019;t remember. And Vince Neil definitely can&#x2019;t remember. Now, they&#x2019;re probably lying about this collective memory block, given that they&#x2019;ve all got a similar rehearsed answer for why this is the end&#x2014;something about not wanting to be out on tour in a decade with none of the group&#x2019;s original members. &quot;Like Guns N&#x2019; Roses,&quot; Vince tells me. &quot;There&#x2019;s only one guy left in the band.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.7">But let&#x2019;s go ahead and take them at their word, because this is M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e, and when you spend thirty-three years in one of the most celebrated, sex-crazed, drug-addled metal bands of the 1980s, you&#x2019;re going to forget more decadence and lunacy than lesser men will experience in a lifetime. Let&#x2019;s focus instead on the fact that they signed a <em>contract</em>&#x2014;they should&#x2019;ve signed it in blood for an added flourish&#x2014;and the contract stipulates that after this tour, none of them can play a show under the name M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e ever again. Of course, &quot;this tour&quot; began last summer and runs until the end of 2015. And of course, musicians are the only people worse than pro athletes at staying retired. But let&#x2019;s take the contract at face value, because these men are no strangers to litigation&#x2014;they&#x2019;ve pretty much all sued one another at some point&#x2014;and because it&#x2019;s more fun to pretend that this really is the end, and that the end didn&#x2019;t actually come, for them and for all of us, a long time ago. The groupies are all married now. They all brought someone tonight to go home with.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.8">So: I&#x2019;m gonna act as if this is the end, and you are, too. So come now, children of the beast. Come in your leather miniskirts and your halter tops. Come in your slitted dresses and your ripped jeans and your stiletto heels. Come in your white jean jackets and your studded bracelets and ratty Overkill T-shirts. Tonight you will see flames&#x2014;<em>clouds</em> of flames. Tonight you will see dancers in latex nurses&#x2019; outfits and fuck-me stockings prancing across the stage. Tonight you will hear very loud guitars connected to very big rows of speakers that will hang from the ceiling, curving and draping like bandoliers across the body of a fearsome demon soldier. Tonight you will sip from guitar-shaped rum runners that cost more than your mortgage. Tonight you will forget what year it is, and you will raise your fist and shout at the Devil one last (maybe?) time. Because tonight is the end, and the end means death and hell and fire&#x2014;FIAHHHHHHH!!!&#x2014;and that is fucking rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll, and this is <em>M&amp;#xF6;tley fucking Cr&amp;#xFC;e</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.9">Also there&#x2019;s gonna be a roller coaster.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.a"><em>I&#x2019;m drinking Modelos in the parking lot with Michelle and Scott.

We&#x2019;re at Cedar Park Center way outside Austin, where the city&#x2019;s Republicans shelter themselves from the liberal food-truck hippies and the hook-&#x2019;em-horns college kids downtown, and it turns out the ceiling of this joint can&#x2019;t support Tommy Lee&#x2019;s drum setup. Tommy has played drums in every conceivable position&#x2014;upside down, sideways, naked, under warrant&#x2014;and now he would like to play drums on a fully functional roller coaster that hurtles him out over the crowd.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;People expect more each time,&quot; Tommy tells me. &quot;So it&#x2019;s just been this constant <em>&#x2019;Okay, fuck, what&#x2019;s the next level?&#x2019;</em> shit. How can we make people walk out of there going, &#x2019;What the fuck?&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.j">But it turns out not every venue on this tour can support a spontaneous drummer-coaster. Dozens of crew members are out here trying to figure out how much of the Cr&amp;#xFC;ecifly they can build. For the moment, it lies in pieces on the arena floor, like sections of track from a toy-train set&#x2014;huge curving steel beams stacked up on massive rolling dollies. So much literal heavy metal. M&amp;#xF6;tley refuses to make things easy, even at the very end. When I ask their longtime manager, Allen Kovac, if the band has stabilized in recent years, he quickly replies, &quot;Onstage, absolutely. Business-wise, nightmare.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.k">Meanwhile, Tommy is holed up in his bus, planning this evening&#x2019;s solo. It&#x2019;s a really nice bus, with granite countertops and tasteful wood paneling; I want to busjack it and drive it to Mexico. Tommy still dresses and talks like a 19-year-old SoCal bro. He&#x2019;s got the tats, and he&#x2019;s rocking a black baseball cap on top of a black bandanna, and somewhere buried beneath all of it is his head. He&#x2019;s as skinny as ever. He looks like one big stretched tendon. But he&#x2019;s 52 now, and his face is more severe.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.l">&quot;I still question some of the venues that we&#x2019;re playing,&quot; he says, grumbling about arenas on the tour that cannot handle the Cr&amp;#xFC;ecifly. &quot;I&#x2019;m like, who the fuck booked this show at Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles in our hometown? There&#x2019;s no roof on the fuckin&#x2019; place.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.m"><em>Why stop touring now, when you could just tour every summer and stockpile cash?</em> I ask him.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.n">&quot;I feel like we&#x2019;ve done everything we came here to fuckin&#x2019; do. People from financial people to business people, friends, family, are going, &#x2019;Are you guys out of your fucking mind? The fucking Stones are still doing this shit. Just fucking do it less often or whatever. You&#x2019;re fucking idiots.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.o">Tommy&#x2019;s engaged now. He&#x2019;s been married three times already&#x2014;once to model Elaine Bergen, once to Heather Locklear, once to Pam Anderson&#x2014;but this new future bride, Sofi, is different. She&#x2019;s not famous. She&#x2019;s Greek, like Tommy. She&#x2019;s <em>normal.</em> And after all those years in M&amp;#xF6;tley, Tommy craves normal. Sofi is here on the bus right now, hanging in the back. I&#x2019;m pretty sure she can hear us talking.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.p">&quot;I&#x2019;ve been in some fucking crazy relationships that maybe weren&#x2019;t the most healthy for the parties involved,&quot; he says. &quot;Sofi&#x2019;s my fucking rock. It&#x2019;s like, <em>Fuck, I wish I would have fucking met you so many years ago</em>. You know? I felt just like, &#x2019;Man, that is the coolest chick. I want to be her buddy.&#x2019; Not even ever thinking, &#x2019;Oh man, I&#x2019;ve gotta fucking hit this.&#x2019; Not even that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.q">Alas, the full Cr&amp;#xFC;ecifly cannot be built for tonight&#x2019;s show. Instead, Austin will get the Cobra: similar to the original coaster, but circumcised a bit at the tip. Tommy&#x2019;s kit, with every last piece bolted down to a steel disc the size of a pitcher&#x2019;s mound, barely fits through the loading door. In a few hours, he&#x2019;ll be strapped into it and lifted thirty feet in the air, spinning in circles and praying that the ceiling doesn&#x2019;t cave in.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.r"><em>Paul and his brother are shitfaced in the concourse. A woman walks by in tight jeans, and the brothers make no effort to disguise their ogling.</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.s"><em>&quot;That&#x2019;s really what the Cr&amp;#xFC;e is, right?&quot; Paul says. &quot;This band&#x2019;s been around for thirty years&#x2014;they&#x2019;re still pulling women like that. Look how bad that bitch is. You&#x2019;re going to see more titties at this concert than you&#x2019;re going to see anywhere else. We followed the bouncing booty all the way here. That&#x2019;s how we got here. We just got out of our car and followed it, and it was all younger than me.&quot;</em></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.t"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d77409f0bee5644026fd/master/w_768/music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-06.jpg" alt="music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-06.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmotley-crue-calling-it-quits&amp;t=music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmotley-crue-calling-it-quits&amp;t=music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmotley-crue-calling-it-quits&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d77409f0bee5644026fd%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmusic-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-06.jpg&amp;description=music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmotley-crue-calling-it-quits&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d77409f0bee5644026fd%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmusic-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-06.jpg&amp;description=music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed h5" data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.u"><h5><strong>Mick</strong></h5></div><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.v">&quot;Can you hold my breasts for the photo?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.w">We are in the back of the arena for a VIP meet and greet. Fans who have paid an ungodly sum of extra money get to shake hands and snap pictures with Vince, Mick, and Nikki. (Tommy doesn&#x2019;t do the meet and greets with fans. &quot;Philosophical issues,&quot; Kovac says.) And now this lady with ample breasts has a special request for Nikki. Nikki is confused.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.x">&quot;You want me to sign them?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.y">&quot;No. <em>Grab</em> them.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.z">&quot;Oh no&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t do that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.10">Mick Mars, the eldest and most pragmatic member of M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e, is dressed in slim black jeans and a black denim vest. The jeans are meant to be skintight, but they hang off his body anyway, as if they&#x2019;re being worn by a ghost. His platform shoes make up for some of the height he&#x2019;s lost to ankylosing spondylitis, a spinal condition that has plagued him since he was a teenager. AS can cause all of your vertebrae to gradually fuse together, which in turn causes your body to stoop into a permanent curve; eventually it results in total immobility. I watch as Mick, hunched over, tries to find a comfortable position to stand in as he greets fans. He winds up leaning back against the wall, heels down, toes up, like a lamp that&#x2019;s been knocked over.

I mean, that doesn&#x2019;t mean that M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e itself, the entity or whatever you want to call it, is going to really stop. Let&#x2019;s use Jimi Hendrix, okay? He still has products coming out way after his death.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.19">That may be true for M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e, but it won&#x2019;t necessarily be the case for its individual members. Kovac has warned all of them that they will never be as successful apart as they have been together, and a couple of them, he says, are having a hard time accepting this fact. &quot;If you look at Tommy&#x2019;s [solo] discography, he likes to experiment, whether it&#x2019;s hip-hop or pop or EDM,&quot; Kovac says, &quot;and he has to come to the understanding, eventually, of whether or not the fans online agree.&quot; The implication is that they do not. After this, there won&#x2019;t be another M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e, not for any of the guys, and not for us.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.1a">I feel the loss myself. Rock music&#x2014;rock music like M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e, anyway&#x2014;is never coming back. Just saying that you like rock now, <em>any</em> rock, new or old, basically makes you a lame old man. The days are long gone when it lorded over the landscape with a cucumber stuffed down its leather pants. When I was in eighth grade, M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e represented all the things I wanted in life but wasn&#x2019;t allowed to have: all the cool drugs, the hot women, the houses on stilts in L.A.... I used to listen to <em>Dr. Feelgood</em> on a tape deck in my room, and I would lie on my bed thinking of every girl in school that I wanted to have sex with (all of them). In my head I would direct a video for &quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot; and pretend all the girls at school were strippers, and all of this seemed FEASIBLE because this is how your brain operates when you&#x2019;re in eighth grade. Rock was that pure <em>want,</em> rendered audible.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.1b">Now it feels like rock exists strictly to make us nostalgic for that sort of feeling, not to actually live it out.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.1c">A 300-pound programmer named William &quot;Viggy&quot; Vignola has joined us on Mick&#x2019;s bus. He&#x2019;s been with the band a long time, and he&#x2019;s explaining to me exactly how things have changed. And even though the old rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll culture nearly killed him, he doesn&#x2019;t seem happy that it&#x2019;s gone.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.1d">&quot;Ever since Pearl Jam, girls weren&#x2019;t welcome on the bus,&quot; he says. &quot;Back in the day, you had to earn your way onto tour buses.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><em>How did Pearl Jam ruin it?</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.1f">&quot;They were the first ones to go [to the groupies], &#x2019;Hey, I just wanna talk.&#x2019; It harshed it.

The Internet killed the mystique.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.1g">Viggy, a recovering alcoholic, spent eight years living with Tommy, trying to get him to stay dry. One year, as a kind of bonus, Tommy &quot;gave&quot; him four porn stars.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><em>What&#x2019;d you do with the porn stars?</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.1i">&quot;They were porno stars.

Or it might just be his face, which is puer now and pretty heavily Botod. He probably <em>could</em> manage a facial expression, but it doesn&#x2019;t seem like he wants to. Vince seems to be at an emotional remove from pretty much everything. His watch is as big as a dinner plate. I bet he checks it a lot.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.1u">&quot;I tour all the time when M&amp;#xF6;tley doesn&#x2019;t tour,&quot; he tells me. &quot;So it&#x2019;s not going to be really any different.

Things. He&#x2019;s an entrepreneur now. He&#x2019;s the majority owner of an arena-league football team, the Las Vegas Outlaws, and he has an exotic-car dealership in Vegas as well. And then there&#x2019;s his new burger franchise.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.20">&quot;It&#x2019;s called Quickee Burgers,&quot; he says. &quot;And it&#x2019;ll be just, like, a kiosk, and it&#x2019;s only $5, and you only get a burger, fries, and a Coke&#x2014;$5.

While drunk and driving well over the speed limit, Neil smashed his Pantera head-on into another car, killing Dingley and severely injuring one of the other car&#x2019;s passengers. Over howls of outrage, Vince served just twenty days in jail. In 1995, he lost his 4-year-old daughter to cancer, an illness that he believed was caused by a Boeing subsidiary named Rocketdyne allegedly dumping toxic waste near his home. He sued the companies for millions, but the lawsuit was thrown out when his lawyer, since disbarred by the state of California, failed to provide documents Boeing had requested for the case. Rocketdyne still exists, and these days Vince often has the look of a man who is just trying to occupy himself as all that death and destruction gets farther away. Everything is a shrug.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.26"><em>Do you have any regrets about your time in the band?</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.27">&quot;If you look backward, you just look at opportunities that you&#x2019;ve totally fucked up.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.28"><em>Does life feel more settled for you now?</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.29">&quot;It&#x2019;s the same.

And he remains M&amp;#xF6;tley&#x2019;s chief songwriter and taskmaster, the man who conceived this whole band and muscled it into reality. He is the &quot;curator of the brand,&quot; which has probably been a more challenging job than playing the bass, considering that M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e transitioned long ago from a rock band to a corporation with four board members. He&#x2019;s the smartest member of the band, Kovac says, &quot;by far.

Tommy and I were talking about it: &#x2019;Remember when we used to do cocaine and fuck all these girls?&#x2019; And we would be in these small towns and all a cop had to do was kick the door in and they would have had themselves a drug arrest.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.2q">The irony here is that by the time Nirvana broke in the early 1990s, M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e had become the bad guys. They were your high school bully&#x2019;s favorite provider of corporatized cock rock. And today they&#x2019;re more of a sleek business enterprise than a rock band. At their shows, you can buy a devil-horn light-up stick for $15. No one&#x2019;s biting the heads off live bats anymore. The danger comes pre-packaged.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.2r"><em>I saw a woman in the VIP section, and she was telling me that her mom once burned her M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e records.</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.2s">&quot;That doesn&#x2019;t seem even possible now,&quot; Nikki says. &quot;Is anybody going to burn a Mumford &amp; Sons record? I don&#x2019;t think so.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.2t"><em>Billy and Eric are a father-son combo, and both of them are rocking Mohawks. Billy sits on his dad&#x2019;s shoulders, wearing protective earmuffs. It looks like he&#x2019;s growing out of his dad&#x2019;s Mohawk.</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.2u"><em>&quot;What&#x2019;s your favorite song?&quot; I ask Eric.</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.2v"><em>&quot;Tell him what your favorite song is,&quot; says his dad. Eric hesitates. &quot;Quit being shy and blow it out,&quot; Billy huffs. &quot;The one where they say &#x2019;ass.&#x2019; Come on.&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.2w"><em>Eric giggles. &quot; &#x2019;Kickstart My Heart.&#x2019; &quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.2x">The lights in the arena are going down. &quot;So Long, Farewell&quot; from <em>The Sound of Music</em> starts blasting from the speakers, briefly perplexing the fans, then sending them into snorts of laughter.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.2y">I&#x2019;ve moved backstage so I can watch the band prepare to walk out, and it must be said: Vince Neil&#x2019;s outfit is fucking ridiculous. There&#x2019;s a crucifix <em>on his dick</em>. Like, a little crucifix ad to the outside of his leather pants. It looks like an outfit Nikki designed for him as a cruel prank. &quot;Vince got more pussy, tenfold, than anyone else in the band,&quot; Nikki told me earlier. &quot;Vince was the first one in the room who would go, &#x2019;I want her, her, and her.&#x2019; And then me and Tommy would take the leftovers. Mick never wanted anything.&quot; That kind of cocksmanship seems implausible with Vince in this getup. But hey, he&#x2019;d know how to attract women better than I would&#x2014;maybe better than any of us. If a cross on his dick works, it works. Dick crosses for everyone.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.2z">I&#x2019;m back out on the main floor of the arena now. Right before any band takes the stage, there&#x2019;s that <em>WOOOOO!!!</em> moment&#x2014;where you scream and you feel your screams exploding out of every part of your face, ears included, as if the sound had been passed through a filter of thick static. I remember this from junior high. It feels good to have my face explode again.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.30">The lights blast on, like someone flipped a switch on the sun, and we&#x2019;re off. M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e&#x2019;s list of classics is just long enough to fill a tidy two-hour performance, and they play every one of them. By the second song (&quot;Wild Side&quot;) Vince is in a groove, hitting the high notes and justifying his penis adornment. Everyone is shrieking. Fire shoots out from the stage on every big riff. I have failed to heed Mick&#x2019;s advice: The heat from the stage is searing.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.31"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d77609f0bee56440271b/master/w_768/music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg" alt="music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmotley-crue-calling-it-quits&amp;t=music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmotley-crue-calling-it-quits&amp;t=music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmotley-crue-calling-it-quits&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d77609f0bee56440271b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmusic-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg&amp;description=music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmotley-crue-calling-it-quits&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d77609f0bee56440271b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmusic-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg&amp;description=music-2015-02-motley-crue-motley-crue-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.32">Hit after hit comes blasting out from Mick&#x2019;s fingers, which seem to be his only remaining functional appendages, as if he asked his illness to spare his hands and attack the rest of his body first. Throughout the arena, men slip behind their wives and girlfriends and grind into them. I see a bunch of dickhead guards roaming around and busting people for weed, and I wonder if those fans loved getting busted one last time. I see countless hot women in leather pants and clingy dresses standing next to stone-faced boyfriends who want to show off their girls but are dying to kick the shit out of you if you dare to ogle.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.33">During &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;&#x2014;the title track from the band&#x2019;s breakthrough 1983 album&#x2014;Nikki busts out a specially designed bass that has been rigged to shoot flames twenty feet in the air. FLAME BASS. He shoots the fire at a hanging pentagram and the pentagram lights up. Your Southern Baptist momma would be <em>so</em> mad. I turn away from the stage to watch the crowd react, and I can see the rock in everyone&#x2019;s faces. I can see every last bit of irony scorched out of their expressions. All that&#x2019;s left is a look of pure, horny, hair-metal giddiness. SHOUT. SHOUT. SHOUT. SHOUT AT THE DEVILLLLLL!</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.34">&quot;Fucking fire, man,&quot; Vince says from the stage. <em>Fucking fire, indeed.</em> He pulls a girl up from the crowd and serenades her with &quot;Without You,&quot; M&amp;#xF6;tley&#x2019;s dim-the-lights mega-hit ballad. (&quot;If you&#x2019;re about 25 years old and in the crowd tonight, it&#x2019;s probably because of this song,&quot; he jokes. The crowd roars.) He whispers in the girl&#x2019;s ear, and even though there&#x2019;s no chance she can hear him with all the noise, she blushes anyway. Vince still has it.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.35">It&#x2019;s time for Tommy&#x2019;s climactic drum solo, and unlike every other wanky, self-indulgent drum solo by every other drummer, this one rivets the crowd. All the phones come out. The Cr&amp;#xFC;ecifly is busted&#x2014;in fact, the band will soon add makeup dates to all the cities that didn&#x2019;t get the full coaster&#x2014;but the Cobra still delivers, spinning Tommy around and thrusting him up to the ceiling and back down again as he beats the shit out of his kit. He plays electronic drums because he hits normal drums too hard.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.36">Tommy spins and spins. And between the spinning and the pounding, he pauses for just a moment.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.37">&quot;PRETTY COOL, EH FUCKERS?!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.38"><em>Three drunk women and one drunk guy are hanging out in the parking lot, trading conspiracy theories about whether Tommy Lee is really Tommy Lee.</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.39"><em>&quot;I saw him in Vegas,&quot; says the man, &quot;and it was an impostor. It was definitely Nikki, and it was definitely Vince, but Mick Mars&#x2014;you never know. It might have been a robot. I&#x2019;m pretty sure Mick Mars is dead.&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3a"><em>You think Mick Mars is dead?</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3b"><em>&quot;Nikki Sixx is dead,&quot; says one of the women.</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3c"><em>Her friend disagrees. &quot;Nikki&#x2019;s alive. Mick&#x2019;s dead.&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3d"><em>I tell them that I just interviewed Tommy before the show and he was very much alive.</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3e"><em>&quot;Can you just ask him to come out for a little bit,&quot; the man asks me, &quot;just to get a BJ from some of my friends?&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3f">Nikki commands the audience to take a break and sit down. He wants to tell them M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e&#x2019;s origin story, about how they first got together in 1981 and vowed to conquer the world. He mentions new-wave music and the crowd boos lustily, because new wave sucked.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3g">&quot;I am so fucking grateful to stand up here with Tommy and Mick and Vince and still be alive, you know?&quot; He will give this same speech tomorrow night in Dallas, and presumably every night for the rest of the tour. &quot;The music&#x2019;s going to live on,&quot; he says, &quot;and we&#x2019;re going to stay in your fucking heads, and in your stereos, and in your fucking life!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3h">And he&#x2019;s right. Even if this is the final tour, M&amp;#xF6;tley Cr&amp;#xFC;e will still be around, as both a brand (ugh) and a memory. Nothing really ends, it just changes, all to prepare you for the biggest change of all, when your heart stops beating and you stop being human and you become something else, an angel or a devil or a pile of topsoil.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3i">&quot;We love you! Let&#x2019;s make some fucking noise!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3j">And back come the guitars. Back come &quot;Live Wire&quot; and &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot; and &quot;Dr. Feelgood,&quot; all dead in my memory for years until this moment, when they are resurrected and pumped full of warm blood. The band rips through &quot;Kickstart My Heart,&quot; and every last remaining pound of TNT in the joint is detonated for the finale. Smoke envelopes the band. All you can see is their silhouettes through the fog. You can&#x2019;t see old or young. You can&#x2019;t see relevance. You can&#x2019;t see 2014 or 1981. The speakers are still buzzing with feedback and everyone is screaming and my ears are ringing and I wouldn&#x2019;t mind if we all just froze here and stayed like this forever, because this is fun.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3k">But then, through the din, I hear Tommy: &quot;We&#x2019;re gonna miss you fuckers.&quot; And that&#x2019;s it. That&#x2019;s the end. They&#x2019;re gone forever.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3l">And then five minutes later they all come back out again.</p><p data-reactid=".iky5v0ei9s.1.1.0.0.4.3m"><a
