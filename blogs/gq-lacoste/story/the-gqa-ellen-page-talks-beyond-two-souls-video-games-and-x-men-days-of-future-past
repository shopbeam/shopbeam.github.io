  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABEYOND: Two Souls—Quantic Dream\u0027s incredibly ambitious follow-up to their 2010 hit Heavy Rain—is in stores now, and we would urge anyone who loves movies, even non-gamers to give it a try. The Playstation 3 exclusive from Sony plays more like an intricate choose-your-own-adventure sci-fi movie, only this movie stars Academy Award nominees Ellen Page (Juno) and Willem Dafoe (Platoon). You play as Jodie Holmes (Page) as she grows from a scared eight-year-old girl to badass twenty-three-year-old woman. That\u0027s fifteen years of life played out within a dreamy landscape filled with spiritual entities, raw emotion, and incredible motion-capture performances. The sheer power of the storyline, combined with Page\u0027s acting, elevates BEYOND: Two Souls to a level most games never achieve. We sat down with the actress to discuss her performance, playing herself in the game, and her return to the X-Men franchise.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: How did you get involved with BEYOND: Two Souls?\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: I got involved like how you get involved with a film. I was sent material and at first, of course, was like, \u0022A video game? What does it mean to be in a video game? Is it just voiceover?\u0022 I didn\u0027t really know. And then I was just so moved by the story, and so excited that this character existed that was so awesome and badass and complex and real. So I played Heavy Rain and I met with David [Cage—writer/director] and was so intrigued by what he wanted to do with this character, and how he wanted to tell a complex story with it, that there was just no hesitation. Really, in that meeting with him, I was just like, \u0022Oh my god, I want to do this!\u0022 [Laughs] And, of course, the opportunity to work with Willem [Dafoe], who I\u0027ve always loved, honestly it was a bit of a no-brainer.\u000A\u000AGQ: But you didn\u0027t set your sights on being in a video game or anything. This just happened naturally.\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: Oh, not at all. No, no, no. It literally came out of nowhere and I was like, \u0022What the hell does this mean?\u0022 [Laughs]\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AGQ: Are you a gamer?\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: I was when I was younger. I was a big video game kid. I had the original Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and the first Playstation. But when I was about sixteen, I sort of stopped because I moved out and I worked and I went to school. To be honest, I was just like a nerd. I never had any time to do anything but maintain schoolwork and work, because I was a working actor. But because of this game, I have played a few games this year, and it\u0027s fun for me because I missed all the incredible technological advances so, for me, it\u0027s insane playing the new Tomb Raider or to experience something like Heavy Rain. I didn\u0027t know people were making games like that, so I think it\u0027s really, really cool what they\u0027re becoming as the medium grows and evolves.\u000A\u000AGQ: Have you gotten a chance to play as yourself yet?\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: I have been playing, yeah. At the risk of sounding like a total narcissist. [Laughs]\u000A\u000AGQ: Is that a weird experience?\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: This might sound really, really silly, but having been such a video game kid and having the first Playstation and understanding how getting games was expensive... They\u0027re not cheap, you know? What is weird is seeing your face on a video game thing. Like on a Playstation thing. I guess you\u0027d wonder why that\u0027s different from a DVD or movie poster, but it just is. It\u0027s trippy. It\u0027s a really trippy experience.\u000A\u000AGQ: Being able to control yourself is weird.\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: Yes, it\u0027s weird, and it\u0027s like, \u0022Oh, that\u0027s my walk. That\u0027s totally how I walk. My weird walk.\u0022 I have feel like I have a bit of a weird walk, so it\u0027s funny to watch that. And it\u0027s funny because you remember, immediately, doing it all in a little room in a suit with dots on your face.\u000A\u000AHere\u0027s the thing too: It\u0027s such a miniscule, miniscule part of this operation. It\u0027s the same when you\u0027re doing a movie, but even more so in a way because there are hundreds and hundreds of people who have spent years and years working on this. I\u0027m such a tiny, tiny part of it, so, for me, when I play it, it\u0027s me or whatever, but I\u0027m also excited to see how it all came together, because I had nothing to do with any of the shit that actually matters. [Laughs]\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AGQ: It has a really ethereal quality to it, and it walks that line between movies and video games. How was it different for you working on something like this compared to working on film and TV sets?\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: There are a lot of differences. First of all, you\u0027re creating a ten-to-twelve-hour experience for the gamer. You\u0027re dealing with a two-thousand page script, so we were going in and doing about thirty to forty pages of material a day, which is insane compared to a film or TV. It varies on the film and budget, but on a film you might do two or three pages a day. Four would be insane. Just that is a huge difference. And then also the fact that when you do film and television you\u0027re used to playing to a camera—one camera—and the constraints of that. What\u0027s funny is that although you\u0027re doing motion capture, which is much more technologically intense, there\u0027s almost less infringement because you\u0027re surrounded by seventy cameras, you can move how you want, and you\u0027re working immediately with an actor. Those would be the major differences—along with the fact that there are no sets or wardrobe or makeup.\u000A\u000AGQ: Just a lot of little dots.\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: Lots of little dots, which you forget about. It\u0027s amazing how well they stay on. They only really come off if you cry, or something like that.\u000A\u000AGQ: So you can focus on just doing the work.\u000A\u000A Ellen page: Yeah, it\u0027s really great. I can\u0027t imagine having a more pure and raw experience as an actor. I think what was most amazing about this job was that it was one of the most fulfilling jobs I\u0027ve ever had as an actor. I don\u0027t think, when I decided to do a video game, that I expected that.\u000A\u000AGQ: I just spoke with the three actors from Grand Theft Auto V, and they stressed how they wanted to be known as actors rather than just voice actors. Having done this game now, do you see that distinction and do you have a new appreciation for how much work goes into these video game performances?\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: Well, yeah. I don\u0027t know why it would be considered different at all. It\u0027s, in a lot of ways, really, really challenging. There was nothing about this where I gave any less than I would give on a film. In a way, you were forced to push it even further because you\u0027re just nonstop every day. There\u0027s no waiting around for lighting or \u0022getting into the zone\u0022 while the camera is turning around. [Laughs] You just have to do it. You just have to do it, and there\u0027s no stopping. Just jump in the deep end and swim until they tell you that you can get out.\u000A\u000AGQ: Would you do another game after this experience?\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: I would. It would just depend on the material. This was so amazing because I loved playing Jodie and I loved being able to be this female protagonist who is so strong and smart and also incredibly vulnerable and damaged and sad. It\u0027s a real incredible, complex character. To be able to do that over years of someone\u0027s life... I mean, what Hollywood movie would that work? It was so cool, man.\u000A\u000AGQ: Right. Unless you\u0027re Benjamin Button, maybe.\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: [Laughs] Unless I\u0027m Brad Pitt. [Laughs]\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AGQ: Anything you can tell us about what Kitty Pryde is up to in X-Men: Days of Future Past?\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: [Laughs] Oh, Lord. No, of course I can\u0027t! [Laughs]\u000A\u000AGQ: [Laughs] Are you excited to be back, though?\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: Oh, my god, of course! First of all, I was not expecting it at all, and it couldn\u0027t be a more awesome, insanely talented, just lovely group of people to be around and work with every day. I think that what Bryan [Singer] is doing with this movie is incredibly ambitious, and it\u0027s also one of those things where you just feel like a tiny part of a huge puzzle, and you\u0027re just so excited to see it all come together in the end.\u000A\u000AGQ: What was it that made you want to make Miss Stevens your directorial debut?\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: The script is incredible. Julia Hart, who wrote it, is a phenomenal writer. I read another script that she wrote for another movie that\u0027s going to be coming out called The Keeping Room and it\u0027s also just phenomenal. She\u0027s an amazing writer. The script is beautiful. It\u0027s funny. It\u0027s sad. It\u0027s emotionally complex, and I think Anna [Faris] is so insanely talented. I think this film will allow us to see Anna in a different way than we have before.\u000A\u000AGQ: You\u0027ve done video games and you started with TV, but you\u0027ve mostly worked in film lately. Are you sticking with film, or is there a chance you\u0027ll return to TV at some point?\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: That would great if there is something that was awesome and someone wanted me to do it. [Laughs] I think it\u0027s trite to say at this point, but TV is so awesome now. The opportunity to play a character for a long time and evolve with a character sounds so intriguing to me. But, again, it\u0027s about what it is, and if someone even wants you to do it.\u000A\u000AGQ: All the stars have to align.\u000A\u000A Ellen Page: Exactly.",

Souls&#x2014;</em>Quantic Dream&#x2019;s incredibly ambitious follow-up to their 2010 hit <em>Heavy Rain</em>&#x2014;is in stores now, and we would urge anyone who loves movies, even non-gamers to give it a try. The Playstation 3 exclusive from Sony plays more like an intricate choose-your-own-adventure sci-fi movie, only this movie stars Academy Award nominees Ellen Page (<em>Juno</em>) and Willem Dafoe (<em>Platoon</em>). You play as Jodie Holmes (Page) as she grows from a scared eight-year-old girl to badass twenty-three-year-old woman. That&#x2019;s fifteen years of life played out within a dreamy landscape filled with spiritual entities, raw emotion, and incredible motion-capture performances. The sheer power of the storyline, combined with Page&#x2019;s acting, elevates <em>BEYOND: Two Souls</em> to a level most games never achieve. We sat down with the actress to discuss her performance, playing herself in the game, and her return to the <em>X-Men</em> franchise.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".23dqlf27h1c.1.1.0.0.4.2"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".23dqlf27h1c.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>GQ: How did you get involved with <em>BEYOND: Two Souls</em>?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".23dqlf27h1c.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>Ellen Page: </strong>I got involved like how you get involved with a film. I was sent material and at first, of course, was like, &quot;A video game? What does it mean to be in a video game? Is it just voiceover?&quot; I didn&#x2019;t really know. And then I was just so moved by the story, and so excited that this character existed that was so awesome and badass and complex and real. So I played <em>Heavy Rain</em> and I met with David [Cage&#x2014;writer/director] and was so intrigued by what he wanted to do with this character, and how he wanted to tell a complex story with it, that there was just no hesitation. Really, in that meeting with him, I was just like, &quot;Oh my god, I want to do this!&quot; <em>[Laughs]</em> And, of course, the opportunity to work with Willem [Dafoe], who I&#x2019;ve always loved, honestly it was a bit of a no-brainer.</p><p data-reactid=".23dqlf27h1c.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>GQ: But you didn&#x2019;t set your sights on being in a video game or anything.

I was a big video game kid. I had the original Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and the first Playstation. But when I was about sixteen, I sort of stopped because I moved out and I worked and I went to school. To be honest, I was just like a nerd. I never had any time to do anything but maintain schoolwork and work, because I was a working actor. But because of this game, I have played a few games this year, and it&#x2019;s fun for me because I missed all the incredible technological advances so, for me, it&#x2019;s <em>insane</em> playing the new <em>Tomb Raider</em> or to experience something like <em>Heavy Rain</em>. I didn&#x2019;t know people were making games like that, so I think it&#x2019;s really, really cool what they&#x2019;re becoming as the medium grows and evolves.</p><p data-reactid=".23dqlf27h1c.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>GQ: Have you gotten a chance to play as yourself yet?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".23dqlf27h1c.1.1.0.0.4.c"> <strong>Ellen Page: </strong>I have been playing, yeah.

They&#x2019;re not cheap, you know? What is weird is seeing your face on a video game thing. Like on a Playstation thing. I guess you&#x2019;d wonder why that&#x2019;s different from a DVD or movie poster, but it just <em>is</em>. It&#x2019;s trippy.

First of all, you&#x2019;re creating a ten-to-twelve-hour experience for the gamer. You&#x2019;re dealing with a two-thousand page script, so we were going in and doing about thirty to forty pages of material a day, which is insane compared to a film or TV. It varies on the film and budget, but on a film you might do two or three pages a day. Four would be insane. Just that is a huge difference. And then also the fact that when you do film and television you&#x2019;re used to playing to a camera&#x2014;one camera&#x2014;and the constraints of that. What&#x2019;s funny is that although you&#x2019;re doing motion capture, which is much more technologically intense, there&#x2019;s almost <em>less</em> infringement because you&#x2019;re surrounded by seventy cameras, you can move how you want, and you&#x2019;re working immediately with an actor. Those would be the major differences&#x2014;along with the fact that there are no sets or wardrobe or makeup.</p><p data-reactid=".23dqlf27h1c.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>GQ: Just a lot of little dots.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".23dqlf27h1c.1.1.0.0.4.m"> <strong>Ellen Page: </strong>Lots of little dots, which you forget about.

I can&#x2019;t imagine having a more pure and raw experience as an actor. I think what was most amazing about this job was that it was one of the most fulfilling jobs I&#x2019;ve ever had as an actor.

I don&#x2019;t know why it would be considered different at all. It&#x2019;s, in a lot of ways, really, really challenging. There was <em>nothing</em> about this where I gave any less than I would give on a film. In a way, you were forced to push it even further because you&#x2019;re just nonstop every day. There&#x2019;s no waiting around for lighting or &quot;getting into the zone&quot; while the camera is turning around. <em>[Laughs]</em> You just have to do it. You just <em>have</em> to do it, and there&#x2019;s no stopping.

First of all, I was not expecting it at all, and it couldn&#x2019;t be a more awesome, insanely talented, just lovely group of people to be around and work with every day. I think that what Bryan [Singer] is doing with this movie is incredibly ambitious, and it&#x2019;s also one of those things where you just feel like a tiny part of a huge puzzle, and you&#x2019;re just so excited to see it all come together in the end.</p><p data-reactid=".23dqlf27h1c.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong>GQ: What was it that made you want to make <em>Miss Stevens</em> your directorial debut?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".23dqlf27h1c.1.1.0.0.4.11"> <strong>Ellen Page: </strong>The script is incredible. Julia Hart, who wrote it, is a phenomenal writer. I read another script that she wrote for another movie that&#x2019;s going to be coming out called <em>The Keeping Room</em> and it&#x2019;s also just phenomenal. She&#x2019;s an amazing writer. The script is beautiful. It&#x2019;s funny. It&#x2019;s sad. It&#x2019;s emotionally complex, and I think Anna [Faris] is so insanely talented. I think this film will allow us to see Anna in a different way than we have before.</p><p data-reactid=".23dqlf27h1c.1.1.0.0.4.12"><strong>GQ: You&#x2019;ve done video games and you started with TV, but you&#x2019;ve mostly worked in film lately.
