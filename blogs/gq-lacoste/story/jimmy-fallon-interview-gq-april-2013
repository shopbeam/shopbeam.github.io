  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAt Frankies Spuntino restaurant in   Brooklyn, Jimmy Fallon orders the   peppers with anchovies to share.  \u0022So great. Phenomenal. You will not  believe.\u0022 it\u0027s a homey place, tight and  worn, unmistakably Brooklyn cool, and not  far from the new Barclays Center arena,  where we\u0027re headed next to watch a Nets-Lakers game. \u0022You haven\u0027t been there yet?\u0022  Fallon says. \u0022No? No. It\u0027s so great!\u0022 He claps.  Clap clap clap. \u0022I get to introduce you.\u0022 He  looks back at the menu. \u0022So, some meatballs? Eggplant parm? We\u0027ll just do some  aps, get to the game by halftime? Whatever  you want. Easy. Easy-peasy.\u0022 It is impossible  to disagree with him.\u000A\u000AFallon says he\u0027s kind of ADD: \u0022Not, like,  diagnosed. Just my personality. Like, I read  one chapter of a book and put it down.  Thank God for Kindle.\u0022 At 38 he still has  a chiseled face, no bags, no fatigue, and  he holds his shoulders high, like he\u0027s in  a state of constant inhale, cocked and  loaded and ready to deliver you a gift. He is joyful, easy, breezy, and if there is a buzz about him now, it is in the context of the Leno-Letterman game of chicken—both of their contracts are up in 2014. Anyone paying attention can see that the famously improbable Fallon is getting groomed for the Tonight Show throne. Even Late Night ecutive producer Lorne Michaels concedes as much: \u0022I\u0027m not allowed to say it—yet. But I think there\u0027s an inevitability to it. He\u0027s the closest to Carson that I\u0027ve seen of this generation.\u0022\u000A\u000AFallon and I are just coming from a Late Night taping, where the audience was  small, maybe 200 people, and the feel was  intimate. \u0022The biggest star on the planet!\u0022  Fallon said, and the blue curtain parted  and out came Justin Bieber, doe-eyed,  with a pompadour, skeleton arms jangling  out of a camo jacket. \u0022I missed you, man,\u0022  Fallon said to him and told him how awesome he was, and then it was time to go  on over and shoot random items at a basketball hoop—an iced cappuccino, a big  bowl of ramen noodles. Noodles? Bieber  missed every shot, but Fallon went girlie-underhand with his noodles, heaved, and the great blast of yellow flew through the air, free, gross, slimy—the whole thing was  so stupid, so inane—and yet the Fallon gospel was clear: It\u0027s okay, America. It\u0027s okay  to lie there in your bed hoping with all  your heart that some friggin\u0027 noodles plop  through a basketball hoop. The noodles  swished through the net, became entangled, a kind of satisfying vomit, and all the people cheered.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m so happy right now. So happy,\u0022 Fallon  says. The peppers have arrived. A plate of  four lying like limp soldiers in olive oil. \u0022It\u0027s good, right?\u0022 Then the clap—clap clap clap.\u000A\u000AMore Jimmy Fallon:\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000A Fallon tells me about first starting Late Night, how he knew audiences were dubious. \u0022They were like, \u0027Jimmy Fallon?\u0027 \u0022 He  had killed during his six-season run on  SNL, from 1998 to 2004, alongside Will  Ferrell, Tracy Morgan, Amy Poehler, and  \u0022Weekend Update\u0022 co-anchor Tina Fey.  Then he left to go do movies (Fever Pitch,  Taxi) that tanked, and which made Lorne  Michaels\u0027s selecting him for Late Night all the weirder. NBC hated the idea at first, but  Michaels was bullheaded; he would only do the show with Fallon.\u000A\u000A \u0022NBC was like, \u0027This is going to flop,\u0027 \u0022  Fallon recalls. \u0022 \u0027This is going to be like  Chevy Chase\u0027s show.\u0027 \u0022 That legendary catastrophe was pulled from the air after just one month. \u0022They were comparing me to that.\u0022\u000A\u000A The point is, Fallon knew he was an  odd choice—he got it. He had his writers  use it almost immediately. \u0022You loved him  on SNL!\u0022 show announcer Steve Higgins  declared in an early skit. \u0022You hated him in the movies! Now you\u0027re ambivalent.\u0022\u000A\u000A Fallon wasn\u0027t edgy. Fallon wasn\u0027t dark or  complicated. Fallon was perhaps too cute  for late-night audiences used to hanging  out with the snarky, cool crowd. \u0022Yeah, the  cool crowd was always beyond my grasp,\u0022  he says. He means this literally. \u0022Like, my  parents had a fence, a chain-link fence, and my sister and I were not allowed outside it.\u0022 This was in upstate New York—Saugerties,  Irish Catholic, strict. \u0022I was only allowed to  ride my bike in my backyard,\u0022 he says. He  rode in a circle, round and round, carving  a dirt track. \u0022Like Gus the polar bear at the  zoo? That was me. Kids would say, \u0027What  are you doing, man? Come out.\u0027 I was like,  \u0027I can\u0027t.\u0027 We got a rope swing. On a tree. We  had to wear football helmets to ride the  swing. Kids could see us. They would pull up  on their bikes so they could watch the Fallon  kids, so weird. You know, \u0027Why are you wearing football helmets?\u0027 We\u0027re like, \u0027So we don\u0027t hit our heads!\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A His parents had parties; that was the  entertainment. \u0022Parties where everyone drinks and performs. I did a Rodney  Dangerfield act.\u0022 He studied Dangerfield\u0027s  No Respect album—minus the curse words.  His dad, as family lore goes, had located all  the bad words on the vinyl recording and  painstakingly scratched them out with a car  key. \u0022I would listen over and over. I didn\u0027t  know what the word was. I didn\u0027t care. I wanted the jokes.\u0022\u000A\u000A A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer  in your pants, said the quote under his high  school yearbook picture. He dropped out of  college his senior year to pursue comedy in L.A., where Michaels found him, laughed at his Adam Sandler impersonation, even  though Michaels famously never laughed  during auditions. Seeing Michaels bury  his face in his hands, crack up like that, it  answered everything. \u0022Every birthday cake  I cut,\u0022 he says. \u0022Every shooting star, every coin in the fountain, I wished: SNL.\u0022\u000A\u000A On the show, he was the guy who  couldn\u0027t keep it together, who laughed during sketches. \u0022Definitely a comedy foul.  Lorne didn\u0027t like it. I didn\u0027t like it. But the  sketches I laughed in became popular.  At the end, it was like the audience was  waiting. The studio started to shake. Like  an earthquake. I couldn\u0027t hold it in anymore. Torture.\u0022\u000A\u000A People criticized him for it, but audiences didn\u0027t care. Fallon\u0027s brand of comedy  included the audience in the experience,  and that, it would turn out, was prescient.  \u0022On Late Night, it\u0027s like we\u0027re all in on the joke,\u0022 he says \u0022That\u0027s what I wanted it to be. I\u0027m not doing  something sneaky. Inside jokes, I don\u0027t like  those. We can all ride together, and everyone\u0027s on the same thing going, \u0027Aha, I know  where you\u0027re going here.\u0027 And if we get weird,  everyone knows, \u0027Okay, we\u0027ll go for that little  ride of being weird.\u0027 Or if I go, okay, I\u0027m going  to try to be Neil Young and sing \u0027Pants on the  Ground.\u0027 We\u0027re all just going to ride it out,  laugh, and we\u0027re going to be like, \u0027This is so silly,\u0027 but it\u0027s happening.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s...a happening,\u0022 he says. \u0022That\u0027s such a  \u002760s word. But that\u0027s what it is. It\u0027s intimate  and we\u0027re all having the same experience. A happening.\u0022\u000A\u000AMeatballs have arrived. He pops one in  his mouth, has to put his fork down it\u0027s so  amazing. \u0022I can\u0027t even tell you. Oh my goodness, phenomenal.\u0022 Clap clap clap. \u0022I can\u0027t say enough. This is just off the charts.\u0022\u000A\u000AAlmost as soon as it aired, Late Night became one of the most buzzed-about  shows on television. \u0022Certainly greeted  more warmly than my choice of Conan  sixteen years earlier,\u0022 Michaels says. The  show was loose, freewheeling, the first to  embrace social media as a key element,  and packaged lovingly with house band the  Roots. Fallon offered a new mood for the post-irony crowd—a new generation with a taste for immediately streamable chunks  of unabashed pop-culture sugar that didn\u0027t  pretend to be nutritious, symbolic, relevant, or important.\u000A\u000A\u0022I just feel like people like a little break,\u0022 he  says. \u0022Especially at 12:37 at night, you go like,  \u0027I\u0027m just tired of the snarky right now. I just  want to lie down and have somebody make  me laugh for an hour. Entertain me and then  I\u0027m going to sleep with a smile on my face.\u0027 That\u0027s my job, that\u0027s what I do.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Tonight Show with...Jimmy Fallon? That  may sound too odd for America to bother  even imagining yet. But Fallon clearly feels the wind of inevitability kicking up.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s not obsessing over it, though. \u0022I mean,  in the nicest way, who really cares?\u0022 he says.  \u0022In the nicest way.\u0022 We\u0027re in the car, headed to  the game, and his producer Gavin Purcell is  texting, saying the Nets are down by nine, and he has beer waiting.\u000A\u000A\u0022It would be great, sure, I guess. I\u0027d love it,  but it\u0027s not on my mind. I\u0027m in no rush to do  anything. I\u0027m kind of a boring character in  that book. I\u0027m not in a fight with Jay or Conan, or any of them. I don\u0027t have that story.\u0022\u000A\u000A He brings up Kimmel. \u0022Love him! So fun to  play with. I\u0027m so happy he\u0027s moved to eleven  thirty. It\u0027s a good move for him. Love him.\u000A\u000A \u0022And Colbert, by the way, is so underrated to me I don\u0027t even know. Can you even  understand he\u0027s doing a character for how  many years now? This is unheard of in comedy. He\u0027s doing something that people will  talk about forever. We did a whole bit where  we were BFFs, and we became enemies and  we hated each other. And then we sang  Fievel the mouse, \u0027Somewhere Out There.\u0027  Looking out the window, remembering that  we were best friends. Such a smart guy. I love  him so much. He\u0027s one of my favorite guys to play with.\u0022\u000A\u000A It\u0027s funny to hear him talk about other  comedians as guys you \u0022play with.\u0022 Like his  mom finally let some kids in the yard. Or, even  better, he got to go to a friend\u0027s house. Which  would have been unfathomable at the Fallon  home. That\u0027s the backdrop against which all  the rest stands in relief. The joy is genuine for  Fallon; everything about being a grown-up is  exciting, phenomenal, so fun. Clap clap clap. He has a wife, Nancy Juvonen-Fallon (Drew  Barrymore\u0027s production partner), he makes  millions and millions of dollars, he has a big  apartment in Manhattan, a big farmhouse in  the Hamptons. No kids. He wants kids. He has season tickets to the Nets.\u000A\u000A I ask if he has a favorite comedian to  play with. No. But he wants to tell me about  Cosby, who came through the curtain and set  in motion the kind of show Fallon holds as  sacred. \u0022He started, like, dancing. And then  I was dancing with him. And then just the  physicality of him walking to the chair. We  just riffed and riffed and riffed.\u0022 The segment  went twenty-five minutes, and afterward  Fallon thought: I can\u0027t believe we put this out  in the world. \u0022Those moments, like, that\u0027s  what you want,\u0022 he says. \u0022Not that I want to  be serious, but I guess I want to send a good message without being preachy.\u0022\u000A\u000AA message?\u000A\u000A \u0022Fun. \u0027Have fun\u0027 is my message. Be silly.  You\u0027re allowed to be silly. There\u0027s nothing wrong with it.\u0022\u000A\u000A And yet it\u0027s not random. Fallon\u0027s com-  edy isn\u0027t slacker, or stoner. It\u0027s orches-  trated—the jokes are polished and the skits  elaborate, like a recent three-part Downton Abbey spoof filmed with costuming and  sets to rival the original. And Fallon\u0027s late-night persona is gracious. He wears a suit,  after all. \u0022People say to me, \u0027Yeah, dude, lose  the suit. It\u0027s so not you.\u0027 I\u0027m like, \u0027I\u0027m hosting a talk show.\u0027 You should show respect  for your guests and your audience. I always  wanted to wear the suit.\u0022 But not the way,  say, Mitt Romney wears a suit. \u0022I did \u0027Mister  Romney\u0027s Neighborhood\u0027 last year. So fun.  Mitt Romney and it\u0027s a beautiful day in the neighborhood. I take off the gray jacket, and in the closet there were all just more  gray suit jackets. So funny. My writers are  so funny.\u0022 He says he got word from Rogers\u0027s  widow after that skit aired: \u0022She loved it. She  said that Fred would have loved it. I was so happy. Because we paid homage.\u0022\u000A\u000A He grew up on Mister Rogers\u0027 Neighborhood. \u0022I loved him,\u0022 Fallon says. \u0022Me and my  sister watched that every day, Mister Rogers. He was so friendly and he was so nice and so  interested in everything.\u0022 The description, I  point out, sort of sounds like that of Jimmy  Fallon. He straightens his posture, shifts his  gaze out the window like an alarm just went  off. \u0022That\u0027s so interesting, I love that you  brought that up. And the message. Be yourself. And be happy with yourself. Be silly. No  matter how weird the neighbor kids think  you are. I never thought of that. Love Mr.  Rogers. Love him. I even watched him when I got too old.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A When people spot Fallon in public, they  do not shriek or drool or go wobbly in the  knees. It\u0027s a different look entirely. A tilt of the  head, mouth agape, eyebrows rolled like you  do when you see a puppy. Everyone does it,  and everyone wants to get closer, and everyone gets a picture. For the most part, that is  the end of it. But it happens constantly, and  it makes snaking through a halftime crowd to  get to your seats at a Nets game a very long, laborious process.\u000A\u000A We\u0027re seated nine rows back, smushed, taking in the crisp newness of the place, black  and white and shiny. \u0022This is so, so great,\u0022 he  says. \u0022A little brew? A plastic cup? A holder  right here? Look at this, huh?\u0022 He holds  his cup up to Gavin for a toast. \u0022De-fense!\u0022 he yells. \u0022Isn\u0027t this great? You get to yell,  \u0027De-fense!\u0027 \u0022 It\u0027s a happening he doesn\u0027t have to host, can just sit back and enjoy.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Cheerleaders come out. It seems like hundreds of them all over the court, all wearing hoods. Silver, shiny, scary hoods, like  they\u0027re headed to the gallows? \u0022Okay, this  is disturbing,\u0022 Fallon says. \u0022People fighting,  flipping around in hoods. I don\u0027t feel safe  right now.\u0022 A guy in silver comes running out  with a handheld cannon. Big, white, solid  bombs fly out. Pelleted T-shirts. \u0022I hate this,\u0022  Fallon says. \u0022This cannot be over fast enough  for me. No one wants a T-shirt. Back to the  game. Oh, God. Oh, my God. I don\u0027t feel  safe.\u0022 He cringes, ducks his head. \u0022This will  not be here in a year,\u0022 he says. \u0022They\u0027re good  dancers, but&amp;\u0022 The announcer screams,  tells everyone to stand up and cheer. \u0022No  one\u0027s standing up. See? They need to work  on this. This will not be here in a year. It\u0027s  a new team. They haven\u0027t figured out what  they want to be yet. That takes time....Wow, I hate this.\u0022\u000A\u000AA guy behind us taps him on the shoulder,  hands him something. A note. Yellow, folded.  Passed down from somebody else. He opens  the note. \u0022Thank you, Jimmy, for not being  a douche front-row celebrity at a Nets game. XOXO, Row 11, Seats 4 &amp; 5.\u0022\u000A\u000A He turns to find them. Two women, heads  tilted, mouths agape. \u0022That just made me happy,\u0022 he says. \u0022So happy. \u0027Not a douche.\u0027 \u0022",

Spuntino restaurant in   Brooklyn, Jimmy Fallon orders the   peppers with anchovies to share.  &quot;So great. <em>Phenomenal</em>. You will not  believe.&quot; it&#x2019;s a homey place, tight and  worn, unmistakably Brooklyn cool, and not  far from the new Barclays Center arena,  where we&#x2019;re headed next to watch a Nets-Lakers game. &quot;You haven&#x2019;t been there yet?&quot;  Fallon says. &quot;No? No. It&#x2019;s so great!&quot; He claps.  <em>Clap clap clap</em>. &quot;I get to introduce you.&quot; He  looks back at the menu. &quot;So, some meatballs? Eggplant parm? We&#x2019;ll just do some  aps, get to the game by halftime? Whatever  you want. Easy. Easy-peasy.&quot; It is impossible  to disagree with him.</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.2">Fallon says he&#x2019;s kind of ADD: &quot;Not, like,  diagnosed. Just my personality. Like, I read  one chapter of a book and put it down.  Thank God for Kindle.&quot; At 38 he still has  a chiseled face, no bags, no fatigue, and  he holds his shoulders high, like he&#x2019;s in  a state of constant inhale, cocked and  loaded and ready to deliver you a gift. He is joyful, easy, breezy, and if there is a buzz about him now, it is in the context of the Leno-Letterman game of chicken&#x2014;both of their contracts are up in 2014. Anyone paying attention can see that the famously improbable Fallon is getting groomed for the <em>Tonight Show</em> throne. Even <em>Late Night</em> ecutive producer Lorne Michaels concedes as much: &quot;I&#x2019;m not allowed to say it&#x2014;yet. But I think there&#x2019;s an inevitability to it. He&#x2019;s the closest to Carson that I&#x2019;ve seen of this generation.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.3">Fallon and I are just coming from a <em>Late Night</em> taping, where the audience was  small, maybe 200 people, and the feel was  intimate. &quot;The biggest star on the planet!&quot;  Fallon said, and the blue curtain parted  and out came Justin Bieber, doe-eyed,  with a pompadour, skeleton arms jangling  out of a camo jacket. &quot;I missed you, man,&quot;  Fallon said to him and told him how awesome he was, and then it was time to go  on over and shoot random items at a basketball hoop&#x2014;an iced cappuccino, a big  bowl of ramen noodles. <em>Noodles</em>? Bieber  missed every shot, but Fallon went girlie-underhand with his noodles, heaved, and the great blast of yellow flew through the air, free, gross, slimy&#x2014;the whole thing was  so <em>stupid</em>, so <em>inane</em>&#x2014;and yet the Fallon gospel was clear: It&#x2019;s <em>okay</em>, America. It&#x2019;s okay  to lie there in your bed hoping with all  your heart that some friggin&#x2019; noodles plop  through a basketball hoop. The noodles  swished through the net, became entangled, a kind of satisfying vomit, and all the people cheered.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.5"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.6"> &quot;I&#x2019;m so happy right now.

dubious. &quot;They were like, &#x2019;<em>Jimmy Fallon</em>?&#x2019; &quot; He  had killed during his six-season run on  SNL, from 1998 to 2004, alongside Will  Ferrell, Tracy Morgan, Amy Poehler, and  &quot;Weekend Update&quot; co-anchor Tina Fey.  Then he left to go do movies (<em>Fever Pitch,  Taxi</em>) that tanked, and which made Lorne  Michaels&#x2019;s selecting him for <em>Late Night</em> all the weirder. NBC hated the idea at first, but  Michaels was bullheaded; he would only do the show with Fallon.</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.c"> &quot;NBC was like, &#x2019;This is going to flop,&#x2019; &quot;  Fallon recalls. &quot; &#x2019;This is going to be like  Chevy Chase&#x2019;s show.&#x2019; &quot; That legendary catastrophe was pulled from the air after just one month. &quot;They were comparing me to that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.d"> The point is, Fallon knew he was an  odd choice&#x2014;he got it. He had his writers  use it almost immediately. &quot;You loved him  on <em>SNL</em>!&quot; show announcer Steve Higgins  declared in an early skit. &quot;You hated him in the movies! Now you&#x2019;re ambivalent.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.e"> Fallon wasn&#x2019;t edgy. Fallon wasn&#x2019;t dark or  complicated. Fallon was perhaps too cute  for late-night audiences used to hanging  out with the snarky, cool crowd. &quot;Yeah, the  cool crowd was always beyond my grasp,&quot;  he says. He means this literally. &quot;Like, my  parents had a fence, a chain-link fence, and my sister and I were not allowed outside it.&quot; This was in upstate New York&#x2014;Saugerties,  Irish Catholic, strict. &quot;I was only allowed to  ride my bike in my backyard,&quot; he says. He  rode in a circle, round and round, carving  a dirt track. &quot;Like Gus the polar bear at the  zoo? That was me. Kids would say, &#x2019;What  are you doing, man? Come out.&#x2019; I was like,  &#x2019;I can&#x2019;t.&#x2019; We got a rope swing. On a tree. We  had to wear football helmets to ride the  swing. Kids could see us. They would pull up  on their bikes so they could watch the Fallon  kids, so weird. You know, &#x2019;Why are you wearing football helmets?&#x2019; We&#x2019;re like, &#x2019;So we don&#x2019;t hit our heads!&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.f"> His parents had parties; that was the  entertainment. &quot;Parties where everyone drinks and performs. I did a Rodney  Dangerfield act.&quot; He studied Dangerfield&#x2019;s  <em>No Respect</em> album&#x2014;minus the curse words.  His dad, as family lore goes, had located all  the bad words on the vinyl recording and  painstakingly scratched them out with a car  key. &quot;I would listen over and over. I didn&#x2019;t  know what the word was. I didn&#x2019;t care. I wanted the jokes.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.g"> <em>A little song, a little dance, a little seltzer  in your pants</em>, said the quote under his high  school yearbook picture. He dropped out of  college his senior year to pursue comedy in L.A., where Michaels found him, <em>laughed</em> at his Adam Sandler impersonation, even  though Michaels famously never laughed  during auditions. Seeing Michaels bury  his face in his hands, crack up like that, it  answered everything. &quot;Every birthday cake  I cut,&quot; he says. &quot;Every shooting star, every coin in the fountain, I wished: <em>SNL</em>.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.h"> On the show, he was the guy who  couldn&#x2019;t keep it together, who laughed during sketches. &quot;Definitely a comedy foul.  Lorne didn&#x2019;t like it. I didn&#x2019;t like it. But the  sketches I laughed in became popular.  At the end, it was like the audience was  waiting. The studio started to shake. Like  an earthquake. I couldn&#x2019;t hold it in anymore. <em>Torture</em>.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.i"> People criticized him for it, but audiences didn&#x2019;t care. Fallon&#x2019;s brand of comedy  <em>included</em> the audience in the experience,  and that, it would turn out, was prescient.  &quot;On <em>Late Night</em>, it&#x2019;s like we&#x2019;re all in on the joke,&quot; he says &quot;That&#x2019;s what I wanted it to be. I&#x2019;m not doing  something sneaky. Inside jokes, I don&#x2019;t like  those. We can all ride together, and everyone&#x2019;s on the same thing going, &#x2019;Aha, I know  where you&#x2019;re going here.&#x2019; And if we get weird,  everyone knows, &#x2019;Okay, we&#x2019;ll go for that little  ride of being weird.&#x2019; Or if I go, okay, I&#x2019;m going  to try to be Neil Young and sing &#x2019;Pants on the  Ground.&#x2019; We&#x2019;re all just going to ride it out,  laugh, and we&#x2019;re going to be like, &#x2019;This is so silly,&#x2019; but it&#x2019;s happening.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.j"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558458dc3655c24c6c983f92/master/w_768/style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-05.jpg" alt="style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-05.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-fallon-interview-gq-april-2013&amp;t=style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-fallon-interview-gq-april-2013&amp;t=style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-fallon-interview-gq-april-2013&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558458dc3655c24c6c983f92%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-05.jpg&amp;description=style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-fallon-interview-gq-april-2013&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558458dc3655c24c6c983f92%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-05.jpg&amp;description=style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.k">&quot;It&#x2019;s...<em>a happening</em>,&quot; he says. &quot;That&#x2019;s such a  &#x2019;60s word. But that&#x2019;s what it is. It&#x2019;s intimate  and we&#x2019;re all having the same experience. A happening.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.l">Meatballs have arrived. He pops one in  his mouth, has to put his fork down it&#x2019;s so  amazing. &quot;I can&#x2019;t even tell you. Oh my goodness, phenomenal.&quot; <em>Clap clap clap</em>. &quot;I can&#x2019;t say enough. This is just off the charts.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.m">Almost as soon as it aired, <em>Late Night</em> became one of the most buzzed-about  shows on television. &quot;Certainly greeted  more warmly than my choice of Conan  sixteen years earlier,&quot; Michaels says. The  show was loose, freewheeling, the first to  embrace social media as a key element,  and packaged lovingly with house band the  Roots. Fallon offered a new mood for the post-irony crowd&#x2014;a new generation with a taste for immediately streamable chunks  of unabashed pop-culture sugar that didn&#x2019;t  pretend to be nutritious, symbolic, relevant, or important.</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.n">&quot;I just feel like people like a little break,&quot; he  says. &quot;Especially at 12:37 at night, you go like,  &#x2019;I&#x2019;m just tired of the snarky right now. I just  want to lie down and have somebody make  me laugh for an hour. Entertain me and then  I&#x2019;m going to sleep with a smile on my face.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s my job, that&#x2019;s what I do.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.o"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.p"><em>The Tonight Show with...Jimmy Fallon</em>? That  may sound too odd for America to bother  even imagining yet. But Fallon clearly feels the wind of inevitability kicking up.</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.q">He&#x2019;s not obsessing over it, though. &quot;I mean,  in the nicest way, who really cares?&quot; he says.  &quot;In the nicest way.&quot; We&#x2019;re in the car, headed to  the game, and his producer Gavin Purcell is  texting, saying the Nets are down by nine, and he has beer waiting.</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.r">&quot;It would be great, sure, I guess. I&#x2019;d love it,  but it&#x2019;s not on my mind. I&#x2019;m in no rush to do  anything. I&#x2019;m kind of a boring character in  that book. I&#x2019;m not in a fight with Jay or Conan, or any of them. I don&#x2019;t have that story.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.s"> He brings up Kimmel. &quot;<em>Love</em> him! So fun to  play with. I&#x2019;m so happy he&#x2019;s moved to eleven  thirty. It&#x2019;s a good move for him. <em>Love</em> him.</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.t"> &quot;And Colbert, by the way, is so underrated to me I don&#x2019;t even know. Can you even  understand he&#x2019;s doing a character for how  many years now? This is unheard of in comedy. He&#x2019;s doing something that people will  talk about forever. We did a whole bit where  we were BFFs, and we became enemies and  we hated each other. And then we sang  Fievel the mouse, &#x2019;Somewhere Out There.&#x2019;  Looking out the window, remembering that  we were best friends. Such a smart guy. I love  him so much. He&#x2019;s one of my favorite guys to play with.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.u"> It&#x2019;s funny to hear him talk about other  comedians as guys you &quot;play with.&quot; Like his  mom finally let some kids in the yard. Or, even  better, he got to <em>go to a friend&#x2019;s house</em>. Which  would have been unfathomable at the Fallon  home. That&#x2019;s the backdrop against which all  the rest stands in relief. The joy is genuine for  Fallon; everything about being a grown-up is  exciting, phenomenal, so fun. <em>Clap clap clap</em>. He has a wife, Nancy Juvonen-Fallon (Drew  Barrymore&#x2019;s production partner), he makes  millions and millions of dollars, he has a big  apartment in Manhattan, a big farmhouse in  the Hamptons. No kids. He wants kids. He has season tickets to the Nets.</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.v"> I ask if he has a favorite comedian to  play with. No. But he wants to tell me about  Cosby, who came through the curtain and set  in motion the kind of show Fallon holds as  sacred. &quot;He started, like, dancing. And then  I was dancing with him. And then just the  physicality of him walking to the chair. We  just riffed and riffed <em>and riffed</em>.&quot; The segment  went twenty-five minutes, and afterward  Fallon thought: <em>I can&#x2019;t believe we put this out  in the world</em>. &quot;Those moments, like, that&#x2019;s  what you want,&quot; he says. &quot;Not that I want to  be serious, but I guess I want to send a good message without being preachy.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.w">A message?</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.x"> &quot;Fun. &#x2019;Have fun&#x2019; is my message. Be silly.  You&#x2019;re allowed to be silly. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.y"> And yet it&#x2019;s not random. Fallon&#x2019;s com-  edy isn&#x2019;t slacker, or stoner. It&#x2019;s orches-  trated&#x2014;the jokes are polished and the skits  elaborate, like a recent three-part <em>Downton Abbey</em> spoof filmed with costuming and  sets to rival the original. And Fallon&#x2019;s late-night persona is gracious. He wears a suit,  after all. &quot;People say to me, &#x2019;Yeah, dude, lose  the suit. It&#x2019;s so not you.&#x2019; I&#x2019;m like, &#x2019;I&#x2019;m hosting a talk show.&#x2019; You should show respect  for your guests and your audience. I always  wanted to wear the suit.&quot; But not the way,  say, Mitt Romney wears a suit. &quot;I did &#x2019;Mister  Romney&#x2019;s Neighborhood&#x2019; last year. So fun.  Mitt Romney and it&#x2019;s a beautiful day in the neighborhood. I take off the gray jacket, and in the closet there were all just more  gray suit jackets. So funny. My writers are  so funny.&quot; He says he got word from Rogers&#x2019;s  widow after that skit aired: &quot;She loved it. She  said that Fred would have loved it. I was so happy. Because we paid homage.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.z"> He grew up on <em>Mister Rogers&#x2019; Neighborhood</em>. &quot;I loved him,&quot; Fallon says. &quot;Me and my  sister watched that every day, <em>Mister Rogers</em>. He was so friendly and he was so nice and so  interested in everything.&quot; The description, I  point out, sort of sounds like that of Jimmy  Fallon. He straightens his posture, shifts his  gaze out the window like an alarm just went  off. &quot;That&#x2019;s so interesting, I love that you  brought that up. And the message. Be yourself. And be happy with yourself. Be silly. No  matter how weird the neighbor kids think  you are. I never thought of that. Love Mr.  Rogers. Love him. I even watched him when I got too old.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.10"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.11"> When people spot Fallon in public, they  do not shriek or drool or go wobbly in the  knees. It&#x2019;s a different look entirely. A tilt of the  head, mouth agape, eyebrows rolled like you  do when you see a puppy. Everyone does it,  and everyone wants to get closer, and everyone gets a picture. For the most part, that is  the end of it. But it happens constantly, and  it makes snaking through a halftime crowd to  get to your seats at a Nets game a very long, laborious process.</p><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.12"> We&#x2019;re seated nine rows back, smushed, taking in the crisp newness of the place, black  and white and shiny. &quot;This is so, so great,&quot; he  says. &quot;A little brew? A plastic cup? A holder  right here? Look at this, huh?&quot; He holds  his cup up to Gavin for a toast. &quot;<em>De-fense</em>!&quot; he yells. &quot;Isn&#x2019;t this great? You get to yell,  &#x2019;De-fense!&#x2019; &quot; It&#x2019;s a happening he doesn&#x2019;t have to host, can just sit back and enjoy.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.13"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558458dc09f0bee56443b8c9/master/w_768/style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-06.jpg" alt="style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-06.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-fallon-interview-gq-april-2013&amp;t=style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-fallon-interview-gq-april-2013&amp;t=style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-fallon-interview-gq-april-2013&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558458dc09f0bee56443b8c9%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-06.jpg&amp;description=style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-fallon-interview-gq-april-2013&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558458dc09f0bee56443b8c9%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-06.jpg&amp;description=style-2013-04-jimmy-fallon-jimmy-fallon-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".2e0ldbpqxa8.1.1.0.0.4.14"> Cheerleaders come out.
