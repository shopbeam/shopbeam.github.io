  	    "articleBody": "When Niyi Okuboyejo, founder of the label Post-Imperial, left Nigeria at the age of 14, his mother told him how accepting and kind people were in the United States. \u0022But she never dealt with teenagers,\u0022 says Niyi, admitting the culture shock he felt arriving stateside as a high school freshman in Houston, Texas. \u0022I learned very fast that being African was not cool.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis lead Niyi to affect a sort of tough-guy act. \u0022I ended up wearing a lot of masks, pretending to be someone I\u0027m not, and becoming friends with some very not-reputable people,\u0022 he says. \u0022But I would lie to my friends and say that I was cutting class to smoke and sell drugs, but I was really going to honors classes.\u0022 By the time he hit junior year, all that acting (and high school football) left him physically exhausted, so he gave it up. Though being from Africa may not have made him popular back then, his heritage and Nigeria-inspired collection of ties and pocket squares is one of the coolest new accessories labels on the market today. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWhat makes Post-Imperial stand out from your average tie purveyor are its beautiful fabrics, which are made using a Yoruban technique called Adire dyeing. It\u0027s a process so old that there are only a few \u0022master dyers\u0022 left in all of Nigeria. Much like old Japanese fabric dyeing techniques, Adire leans heavily on the use of indigo, but generally uses a wider variety of pattern and color. Its cultural roots come from traditional Nigerian ceremonies, where cloths are exchanged at weddings, each with a motif that has specific reference and meaning.\u000A\u000ANiyi respects and is proud of this cultural history. He says that sharing Nigerian culture as well as the larger African diaspora is at the heart of his brand. But he\u0027s refreshingly wary of being overly nostalgic. \u0022It\u0027s called Post-Imperial because it\u0027s about the time after old regimes, and creating for today,\u0022 he says. \u0022It\u0027s cool to look at old photos and fantasize, but we should be creating our own images. Twenty years from now, people should look at our time and fantasize about it.\u0022 He doesn\u0027t fetishize tradition or allow it to hinder the way he wants the end product to look. For instance, the frayed edges featured on all of his products, from ties to pants to shirts, exist for no other reason than Niyi likes the way they look. \u000A\u000A\u0022I want to make products that people like because they like the way it\u000Alooks. Then once they pick it up, they can start learning about the\u000Astory.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000AThis often leads to friction between Niyi and the master dyers. \u0022Each time I\u0027m with them, the process takes about three hours, and most of that is spent convincing them that my ideas work. These guys have been doing this for years, so I have to convince them to try it.\u0022 He goes to bat for his ideas not out of arrogance, but because he knows the end product has to, above all, be attractive to buyers. \u0022Anyone can make something avant-garde, and people will look at it and think, \u0027Oh that\u0027s interesting,\u0027 but they won\u0027t wear it. I want to make products that people like because they like the way it looks. Once they pick it up, they can start learning about the story,\u0022 he says. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe result of this balancing act between past and present, avant-garde and classic is an unfamiliar but exciting mix of cultures. The ties, scarves, pocket squares, and even apparel are certainly conversation-starters, but are approachable enough to be added to even the most conservative of wardrobes. For men sick of standard rep ties, Post-Imperial has a Adire-dyed version with colors that crack and bleed outside the lines, giving the style newfound personality. Those who want to get even riskier and really light up a big meeting can reach for more complicated motifs in a range of bright colors. And there\u0027s no man on earth who wouldn\u0027t occasionally benefit from a jolt of energy in the form of a Adire-dyed pocket square. \u000A\u000AIf you\u0027re looking to buy Post-Imperial products today, your best bet is the brand\u0027s online store. Most of the the label\u0027s brick-and-mortar retail accounts are currently in Japan, where men are always three steps ahead of even the most stylishly-inclined in the Western world. But Post-Imperial is set to land in stateside this fall at Unis, one of America\u0027s best stores. Niyi learned long ago that people may not be as kind and accepting in the United States as his mother said they would be, but now at 32-years-old, he\u0027s just as American as anyone. \u0022I\u0027ve seen both sides, and I appreciate both sides. And my experiences in America have helped shape my aesthetic,\u0022 he says. As he grows older and experiences new things, Post-Imperial will continue to evolve. As Niyi puts it, \u0022The dyeing process is just one part of what the diaspora has to say.\u0022 It\u0027s easy to fall in love with the fabric-heavy story Post-Imperial is telling now, but we\u0027ll definitely be listening as the brand begins to say new things. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest",

and kind people were in the United States. &quot;But she never dealt with teenagers,&quot; says Niyi, admitting the culture shock he felt arriving stateside as a high school freshman in Houston, Texas. &quot;I learned very fast that being African was not cool.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".5qyst1dekg.1.1.0.0.4.1">This lead Niyi to affect a sort of tough-guy act. &quot;I ended up wearing a lot of masks, pretending to be someone I&apos;m not, and becoming friends with some very not-reputable people,&quot; he says. &quot;But I would lie to my friends and say that I was cutting class to smoke and sell drugs, but I was really going to honors classes.&quot; By the time he hit junior year, all that acting (and high school football) left him physically exhausted, so he gave it up. Though being from Africa may not have made him popular back then, his heritage and Nigeria-inspired collection of ties and pocket squares is one of the coolest new accessories labels on the market today. </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".5qyst1dekg.1.1.0.0.4.2"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55b78aa2962900e47cf125f7/master/w_806/post-imperial-02.jpg" alt="post-imperial-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpost-imperial-ties-interview&amp;t=post-imperial-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpost-imperial-ties-interview&amp;t=post-imperial-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpost-imperial-ties-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b78aa2962900e47cf125f7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpost-imperial-02.jpg&amp;description=post-imperial-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpost-imperial-ties-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b78aa2962900e47cf125f7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpost-imperial-02.jpg&amp;description=post-imperial-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".5qyst1dekg.1.1.0.0.4.3">What makes Post-Imperial stand out from your average tie purveyor are its beautiful fabrics, which are made using a Yoruban technique called Adire dyeing. It&apos;s a process so old that there are only a few &quot;master dyers&quot; left in all of Nigeria. Much like old Japanese fabric dyeing techniques, Adire leans heavily on the use of indigo, but generally uses a wider variety of pattern and color. Its cultural roots come from traditional Nigerian ceremonies, where cloths are exchanged at weddings, each with a motif that has specific reference and meaning.</p><p data-reactid=".5qyst1dekg.1.1.0.0.4.5">Niyi respects and is proud of this cultural history. He says that sharing Nigerian culture as well as the larger African diaspora is at the heart of his brand. But he&apos;s refreshingly wary of being overly nostalgic. &quot;It&apos;s called Post-Imperial because it&apos;s about the time after old regimes, and creating for today,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s cool to look at old photos and fantasize, but we should be creating our own images. Twenty years from now, people should look at our time and fantasize about it.&quot; He doesn&apos;t fetishize tradition or allow it to hinder the way he wants the end product to look. For instance, the frayed edges featured on all of his products, from ties to pants to shirts, exist for no other reason than Niyi likes the way they look. </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".5qyst1dekg.1.1.0.0.4.6"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&quot;I want to make products that people like because they like the way it

These guys have been doing this for years, so I have to convince them to try it.&quot; He goes to bat for his ideas not out of arrogance, but because he knows the end product has to, above all, be attractive to buyers. &quot;Anyone can make something avant-garde, and people will look at it and think, &apos;Oh that&apos;s interesting,&apos; but they won&apos;t wear it. I want to make products that people like because they like the way it looks. Once they pick it up, they can start learning about the story,&quot; he says. </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".5qyst1dekg.1.1.0.0.4.8"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55b78aa5624390b3498114b4/master/w_806/post-imperial-05.jpg" alt="post-imperial-05.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpost-imperial-ties-interview&amp;t=post-imperial-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpost-imperial-ties-interview&amp;t=post-imperial-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpost-imperial-ties-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b78aa5624390b3498114b4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpost-imperial-05.jpg&amp;description=post-imperial-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpost-imperial-ties-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b78aa5624390b3498114b4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fpost-imperial-05.jpg&amp;description=post-imperial-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".5qyst1dekg.1.1.0.0.4.9">The result of this balancing act between past and present, avant-garde and classic is an unfamiliar but exciting mix of cultures. The ties, scarves, pocket squares, and even apparel are certainly conversation-starters, but are approachable enough to be added to even the most conservative of wardrobes. For men sick of standard rep ties, Post-Imperial has a Adire-dyed version with colors that crack and bleed outside the lines, giving the style newfound personality. Those who want to get even riskier and really light up a big meeting can reach for more complicated motifs in a range of bright colors. And there&apos;s no man on earth who wouldn&apos;t occasionally benefit from a jolt of energy in the form of a Adire-dyed pocket square. </p><p data-reactid=".5qyst1dekg.1.1.0.0.4.a">If you&apos;re looking to buy Post-Imperial products today, your best bet is the brand&apos;s <a href="http://post-imperial.com/">online store</a>. Most of the the label&apos;s brick-and-mortar retail accounts are currently in Japan, where men are always three steps ahead of even the most stylishly-inclined in the Western world. But Post-Imperial is set to land in stateside this fall at Unis, one of America&apos;s best stores. Niyi learned long ago that people may not be as kind and accepting in the United States as his mother said they would be, but now at 32-years-old, he&apos;s just as American as anyone. &quot;I&apos;ve seen both sides, and I appreciate both sides. And my experiences in America have helped shape my aesthetic,&quot; he says. As he grows older and experiences new things, Post-Imperial will continue to evolve. As Niyi puts it, &quot;The dyeing process is just one part of what the diaspora has to say.&quot; It&apos;s easy to fall in love with the fabric-heavy story Post-Imperial is telling now, but we&apos;ll definitely be listening as the brand begins to say new things. </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".5qyst1dekg.1.1.0.0.4.b"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div
