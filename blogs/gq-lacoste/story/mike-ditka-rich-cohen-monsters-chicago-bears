  	    "articleBody": "\u000A\u000A The pieces of the 1985 Bears began to come together in 1939, when Mike Ditka was born in Carnegie, Pennsylvania. His parents had emigrated from Ukraine, where the family name was Dyczko, which each uncle Americanized in his own way, Disco being the least fortunate variation. It\u0027s hard to imagine Mike Disco becoming anything but a dancing machine; Ditka was more appropriate for a son of Aliquippa, the tough west Pennsylvania factory town where he spent his formative years. The coach\u0027s father worked as a welder in a steel mill, \u0022a burner\u0022 on a train that ran through the factory that employed just about everyone in town. The old man would come home with blisters on his hands, wounds of a working life. He\u0027d been a Marine and was a strict disciplinarian. \u0022What he said, he said, that was it,\u0022 Ditka wrote. \u0022He didn\u0027t spare the rod.\u0022 Ditka\u0027s autobiography is filled with phrases like \u0022worst beating of my life.\u0022 \u0022If I didn\u0027t [do what he said],\u0022 wrote Ditka, \u0022he gave me a hard time. By a hard time, I mean he simply whipped my ass.\u0022 Such poundings usually came in response to some bit of mischief. A neighbor once described young Mike Ditka as \u0022a high intensity boy.\u0022 On one occasion, experimenting with cigarettes, he burned down a stand of trees behind the family house. When Ditka\u0027s father came home, he wondered what had happened \u0022to the forest.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Ask your son,\u0022 his wife told him.\u000A\u000A \u0022I got nailed,\u0022 Ditka wrote. \u0022He had an old leather Marine belt. It was probably the hardest whipping I ever got.\u0022\u000A\u000A Some people, you see a picture of them taken in third or fourth grade, you have no idea who it is. Of course, when you\u0027re told, the features reassemble themselves in a familiar way and you think, Oh yeah, now I see my friend. But with Ditka, you know right away: the chipmunk cheeks and broad forehead, the mouth turned fiercely down, the amused glint, the peaked, bearlike hairline—it was all there from the start. And the smile. Mike Ditka has a great smile. It wrinkles his cheeks and makes his eyes vanish. It\u0027s a cute smile, surprisingly adorable in an otherwise tough face. In fact, it\u0027s so cute it\u0027s scary. If a bear smiled at you, that would be scary, too. You see a thing like that in the woods, you think, I\u0027m done.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Ditka grew up in the 1940s and 1950s, a boom time for Aliquippa and places like it, hardscrabble towns in Appalachia, where refineries churned out steel for the battleships and fighter planes to defeat the Communists. Main Street was filled with life—candy stores, the men\u0027s shop, the five-and-dine, the union hall, the saloon, parades and banners, excited talk about the high school football game against Beaver Falls. The slums were at the bottom of the valley, in the shadow of the mill, tin roofs, sagging porches, old men in undershirts, smoking cigarettes and drinking beer. \u0022It was a very ethnic area,\u0022 Ditka wrote, \u0022which was also very prejudiced. Whether you were a Polack or a Hunky or a Jew or a Dago or a Wop or a Cake-eater or Colored—we didn\u0027t use the other slang word for blacks—it was prejudiced.\u0022\u000A\u000A The rich people lived up the hill—the more you had, the higher you got, until you reached the mansions built into the ridgeline, from where you could see other valleys where other factories spewed smoke, prejudice, and gridiron heroes. It was the kingdom of football, the breeding ground of so many of the players who defined the game: Bednarik, Unitas, Montana, Marino, Namath—the list is ridiculous. When I asked Ditka why so many great players came from western Pennsylvania, he said, \u0022It\u0027s the work ethic, the way people were brought up. The parents came from the old country and worked in the mills and the mines. People didn\u0027t have anything but didn\u0027t need anything. They were tough. Were they tougher than they were in Nebraska? I don\u0027t know. But they were tough.\u0022\u000A\u000A Ditka spent his free time playing games in the weeds between the houses. Basketball, baseball, mob ball. He was a bad loser from the beginning. If things went wrong, he went nuts, stormed off, stormed back, threw a bat, chucked a ball, hit a guy, stormed off again, came back again, hit someone else. He was made for football. It became increasingly obvious as he got older. He was a late bloomer, small his first years at Aliquippa High School, but this just added intensity to size when he finally grew in his junior year. He credits everything to his high school coach, Carl Aschman, whom he ranks with the other great coaches of his life: George Halas and Tom Landry. Ditka played every position in high school—offensive line, running back, linebacker, punter—but mostly he was just out there kicking ass. Later, speaking of why he loved football, he said, \u0022When you step onto the football field, everybody\u0027s equal. And when you step off, everybody\u0027s not equal anymore. Somebody\u0027s won and somebody\u0027s lost. Somebody\u0027s dominated and somebody\u0027s been dominated. Somebody\u0027s taught and somebody\u0027s learned.\u0022\u000A\u000A Aliquippa won the Pennsylvania State Championship in 1955, with Ditka playing both ways, a mill town all star. He was recruited by Jim Finks at Notre Dame—Finks was the Bears general manager when Ditka took over as coach—and Joe Paterno at Penn State, but chose Pitt for its premed program. Ditka planned on being a dentist after football—imagine those giant fingers rooting around your mouth. By 1959, he\u0027d become one of the best college players in the nation. He played linebacker on defense and fullback on offense. He was quick, hard-hitting, and mean, but his hands were what made him special. It was rare for a big man to have such soft hands. Pitt did not throw often, but when they did go to Ditka, he almost always made the catch. And after he made it, he was nearly impossible to bring down. A player that size running in the open was a new development, so new most pro scouts hardly took notice. It was assumed that Ditka would play defense in the NFL, where his soft hands would help him make interceptions.\u000A\u000A When the Bears drafted Ditka first in 1961, it was with another idea in mind. Halas and his assistant, George Allen, wanted to put Ditka on the offensive line. He would block on most plays but now and then skirt away from the trenches, head downfield ten or fifteen yards, turn around, and catch a pass. Winning football games is not about pitting strength against strength, speed against speed. It\u0027s about finding a mismatch, a situation in which their little guy has to tackle your monster, or their monster has to chase your sprinter. If Ditka got downfield, he\u0027d be covered by defensive backs half his size. It was a strategy made possible only by Ditka\u0027s special gift: Big guys almost never had such soft hands. In this way, Halas created what has since become a dominant weapon in the NFL: Mike Ditka was the first modern tight end. \u0022Nobody threw to the tight end back then,\u0022 he told me. \u0022He was just another guy on the line of scrimmage, next to the tackle. Then Halas had this idea to throw me the ball. He realized it was hard for me to get off the line when I was next to the tackle, so he moved me three or four yards down. I was the first tight end to flex out.\u0022\u000A\u000A Ditka was twenty-one when he arrived at training camp. He had also been drafted by the Houston Oilers of the new American Football League, but his dream had always been to play in the NFL. His first contract paid him $12,000 plus a $6,000 signing bonus, which George Allen said was the \u0022biggest contract we\u0027ve paid anyone since Red Grange.\u0022 When Ditka brought the agreement home to Aliquippa, his father looked it over, frowned in a slightly disapproving way, and said, \u0022Most men have to work a long time to get that kind of money.\u0022\u000A\u000A Ditka had the hands but caught the ball in the untutored way of the sandlot. Turning what you\u0027ve always done by instinct into a practice, a trade—that\u0027s what makes you a professional. Halas brought Sid Luckman back to work with Ditka, teach him the proper way to catch. Sid was forty-four years old, gray, soft, ancient, a figure of lore. He had a method, a way to concentrate the rookie. He gathered a pile of footballs and wrote a number on each: 27, 61, 33. Ditka ran pattern after pattern. As soon as he made a catch, he had to call out the number on the ball. This would teach him the art of high focus: just you and the ball, watching it all the way into your hands. In 1961, Ditka caught 56 passes for 1,076 yards. He scored twelve touchdowns. No tight end had ever done anything like it. He was named Rookie of the Year and made the Pro Bowl, an honor he would secure in each of his first four seasons.\u000A\u000A It was not just the statistics that earned Ditka respect—it was how he played, the fierceness of his game. He answered every challenge, returned every insult. He tore it up. In his fifth game, the Bears played the Baltimore Colts, where Ditka faced Bill Pellington, one of the toughest linebackers in football. He\u0027d knocked the Lions\u0027 tight end Jim Gibbons out not long before. \u0022So all week all I heard was how tough Bill Pellington was and how he was going to knock the crap out of me,\u0022 Ditka wrote later. \u0022Well, I lined up on the first play from scrimmage and by God they were right. He punched me right in the mouth. I wore that little, thin bar [on my helmet] that didn\u0027t protect anything. He punched me right in the mouth and I said, \u0027Oh. Boy.\u0027 On the next play— I don\u0027t know what the play was—didn\u0027t matter. I didn\u0027t even care. I don\u0027t know if it was a pass play or a run. I just gave him a head fake, drew back and punched him as hard as I could.\u0022\u000A\u000A In Green Bay, Ditka battled Packers Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Nitschke on the field and off. One night, after a rough game, they ran into each other in a restaurant. They started jawing back and forth. Then Nitschke pointed a big finger in Ditka\u0027s face and said, \u0022I\u0027m going to get you.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022If you get me, you better get me good,\u0022 said Ditka. \u0022One thing in life you\u0027ve got to remember is if you\u0027re trying to get somebody, you don\u0027t get got.\u0022\u000A\u000A Ditka was guided by a code, a slightly demented sense of football right and wrong. In the third quarter of a game in Los Angeles, a drunken fan dashed onto the field. The cops pursued. The crowd roared. It used to happen a lot: a drunk running higgledy piggledy as police fell all over themselves. As he crossed midfield, Ditka stepped out of the huddle and ended it with a single blow. The guy went up, turned over in the air, then dropped lifelessly to the ground. He looked dead. It was sickening—a butterfly meets a tank. Explaining why he did it after the game, Ditka could have been summing up his entire philosophy: \u0022Because that guy\u0027s got no fucking right to be on the field! The field is for players!\u0022\u000A\u000A Ditka played his first NFL game in Minneapolis against the expansion Vikings. He earned notice from the veterans right away. A rookie is supposed to be quiet in the huddle, but Ditka cursed everyone out for letting the game slip away. Losing to an expansion team is a particular kind of ignominy. The plane was quiet going home, the Convair 320 rumbling through the dark. Halas came on the PA: \u0022I want to say just one thing to you guys. You\u0027re nothing but a bunch of cunts!\u0022\u000A\u000A Halas taught Ditka the game: how to play, how to coach, when to praise, when to call the boys a bunch of cunts. Watching him operate was better than ten years in school. He was a wizard, a pioneer, but it was his attention to detail that really impressed. I mean, here was this guy, a founder of the NFL, a standout for Coach Zuppke, a man who stripped the ball from Jim Thorpe, and what\u0027s he doing at age sixty-six? Weighing every kid on the roster, standing by with a clipboard, stopwatch, and pen. \u0022Nobody weighed anybody except him,\u0022 Ditka said. \u0022He didn\u0027t trust anyone. We had to do it twice a week.\u0022 It was a $23 fine for every pound over. \u0022The most fun anybody even had was the weigh-in. They used to trick the scales. The old man would go crazy. One guy would get on and another guy would put his finger under the cheek of his ass. Another guy would get on the scale with weights in his jockstrap.\u0022\u000A\u000A Halas personally negotiated every contract. No lawyers, no agents, just you and the old man, eyeball to eyeball across the desk. \u0022Halas embarrassed you,\u0022 Ditka wrote. \u0022Ripped you apart. After I signed my first contract for $12,000 plus that $6,000 bonus, I made Rookie of the Year and All-Pro. I came back and he offered me $14,000. I said, \u0027Coach, you\u0027re making a mistake. I made $18,000 last year. You\u0027re giving me a $4,000 cut.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022How do you figure you made $18,000?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Twelve plus six is eighteen.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Well,\u0022 he said, \u0022The six was a bonus, remember? The bonus doesn\u0027t count.\u0022\u000A\u000A Ditka begged and pleaded until Halas agreed to bump him up to $18,000, then reached into his desk and brought out a contract already made out in that amount.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The Bears had floundered in the seasons since Sid Luckman retired. That\u0027s what happens when a dynasty collapses: the palace falls to ruins, the countryside is plunged into darkness. When Ditka was drafted, it had been fifteen years since the team played for a championship. His arrival marked a crucial step on the way back. He gave the Bears a new spirit. They were better in 1961 than they\u0027d been in 1960, and still better in 1962. By 1963, they were ready to make a title run. In addition to Ditka, there was linebacker Bill George, quarterback Bill Wade, running back Willie Galimore, defensive tackle Doug Atkins. Mike Pyle played center, a nasty position: you start the play with the snap, then get hit in the head. In the old days, before it was banned, the defensive player lined up across from the center—the noseguard—and often reared back and slapped the center on the ear, knocking him silly.\u000A\u000A Mike Pyle was unusual. Most pros come from waste places, mill cities and industrial towns. But Pyle grew up in Winnetka, on Chicago\u0027s North Shore. His father was an ecutive at Kraft Foods. Mike went to Yale, where he was tapped by Skull &amp; Bones. (Yalies of that era still speak of the Pyle brothers with awe.) I took a special interest in Pyle because we went to the same high school, New Trier, which has turned out lots of bankers, doctors, actors, and politicians—Charlton Heston, Rock Hudson, Donald Rumsfeld—but few professional athletes. We\u0027re the candy-asses by the lake. It made Pyle seem a kind of wonder, a New Trier Indian who\u0027d gone all the way. He spoke at a pep rally my senior year. There is a picture of it in my yearbook. He was still a big man, straining the stitches of his suit, bearded, with thick wrists. He was forty-seven, forty-eight, the age that I am now, but I feel the same age as always, whereas he seemed so much older. I can\u0027t recall a word he said, but I do remember how he looked, the way he carried himself. He pounded the lectern as the high school football coach nodded at his side. He was like Hemingway returning to Oak Park High in a cape, unbuttoning his tunic to show the seniors his scars. I asked Ditka about Pyle: What\u0027s he up to now? The coach crossed his arms, looked at me. \u0022I love Mike, but he\u0027s not doing well,\u0022 he said. \u0022You know, in my day, the helmets were not the best, just a piece of plastic, and the center got pounded, slapped in the head all game. I used to talk to Mike every week but it\u0027s been a long time since he\u0027s called.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The \u002763 Bears opened with a string of victories. By late November, the fate of the season hung on a game against the Steelers. That Friday, as the players were packing, word came over the radio: President Kennedy had been shot in Dallas. A few hours later, when the first reports were followed by news of the president\u0027s death, the country was plunged into black sorrow. Everyone assumed the game would be canceled. The American Football League canceled everything, but NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle said the games would go on, a decision he later regretted. The Bears did not want to play: How do you gin up the fury? How do you convince yourself it matters? \u0022We wanted no part of it,\u0022 Ditka told me. \u0022We\u0027re Americans first and we were destroyed, but we\u0027re soldiers, too. They tell us to play, we play. Then, of course, you get out there and get popped in the mouth, and the world disappears and there is only the game.\u0022\u000A\u000A November 24, 1963: the emperor lay dead in the capital but the gladiators carried on at the Forum. The game was played at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh in front of a glowering crowd of drunks who should have been somewhere else. Before the coin toss, Halas got his team in a circle and said, \u0022We\u0027re going to play this game to get people\u0027s minds off the assassination.\u0022 Late in the fourth quarter, the Bears were down 17–14. If they lost, no championship. Clouds rolled in from the west. Billy Wade took the snap. Ditka went upfield, hit a linebacker, turned, looked at the ball all the way in, caught it, tucked it, and headed for the end zone, the burner\u0027s son running under an inky sky. He had about seventy yards to go. Every time a Steeler came up to make the stop, Ditka would bring his big forearm around. He broke tackle after tackle, leaving the wounded in his wake. He was finally brought down by defensive back Clendon Thomas deep in Pittsburgh territory. He\u0027d gone fifty yard after the catch. He lay on the field spent, an burned out engine. In Chicago, they called it \u0022the run.\u0022 \u0022That was the luckiest run in the world,\u0022 Ditka said. \u0022It was a combination of me being tired, them being tireder, and poor tackling. It was terrible.\u0022\u000A\u000A The Bears kicker Roger Leclerc hit an eighteen-yard field goal to tie the game. Pittsburgh got the ball back with seconds left, ran a play, then another, then before anyone realized what was happening, a Steelers\u0027 receiver was going downfield for a touchdown. He crossed the goal line and raised his arms, but at some point, way back there, impossible to hear above the crowd, a whistle had been blown. The play was no good though no one was sure why. In the meantime, the last second had run off the clock. It was over. A murmur went through the crowd: Halas paid off the refs! He bought the fuckin\u0027 thing! The drunkest fans came over the wall. It was a mob. The refs blew their whistles but were quickly overwhelmed. The Bears got their coach and raced through a storm of beer cans. They got to the locker room and shut the door only to realize a Pittsburgh reporter had followed them inside. He was waving his notebook in the old man\u0027s face, cursing, You bought it, you evil bastard, you bought it, didn\u0027t you? For a long moment, Halas stared into the face of the reporter as a you stare into a garbage compacter that will not turn, wondering, what the hell is down there? His eyes flashed, but before he could move, Ditka had the reporter and was carrying him through the locker room and dumping him in the hall. He slammed the door. It got quiet. They stared at each other. Someone turned on a TV. Cronkite or Brinkley. What he was saying made no sense: the man who\u0027d shot the president had himself been shot in a garage in Dallas.\u000A\u000A The NFL Title Game was played in Wrigley Field. The Giants were led by the Hall of Fame quarterback Y. A. Tittle. One of those ancients who seemed to play forever—he was thirty-seven when he faced the Bears in the championship—Tittle was the subject of perhaps the greatest sports photo ever taken. It shows him on his knees on the turf. His helmet has been knocked off, blood trickles from his head. Beaten and old, the gladiator suffers stoically. The final score was Bears 14, Giants 10. \u0022I guess today\u0027s game proves that if you live long enough, everything you want to happen will happen,\u0022 Halas said. He was named Coach of the Year. He was sixty-eight. It was the last time he\u0027d see the Bears win a championship.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A \u0022Why didn\u0027t you repeat?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022What\u0027s that?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Why didn\u0027t your championship team repeat?\u0022\u000A\u000A This was me talking to Ditka over dinner one night. He sat back in his chair; his eyes glittering as he said, \u0022Well, you see, right there, you\u0027ve put your finger on the big question. Why\u0027s it so hard for a team that\u0027s won to win again? Maybe winning is the greatest thing that can happen to a team and also the biggest disaster. It\u0027s never the same after you win.\u0022",

this chapter from Rich Cohen&#39;s new book, <em>Monsters: The 1985 Chicago Bears and the Wild Heart of Football</em>, the author tracks the life of Bears tight end and future head coach Mike Ditka, from his days in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania to the 1963 NFL Championship</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed noscript" data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.0"><noscript></noscript></div><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.1"> The pieces of the 1985 Bears began to come together in 1939, when Mike Ditka was born in Carnegie, Pennsylvania. His parents had emigrated from Ukraine, where the family name was Dyczko, which each uncle Americanized in his own way, Disco being the least fortunate variation. It&apos;s hard to imagine Mike Disco becoming anything but a dancing machine; Ditka was more appropriate for a son of Aliquippa, the tough west Pennsylvania factory town where he spent his formative years. The coach&apos;s father worked as a welder in a steel mill, &quot;a burner&quot; on a train that ran through the factory that employed just about everyone in town. The old man would come home with blisters on his hands, wounds of a working life. He&apos;d been a Marine and was a strict disciplinarian. &quot;What he said, he said, that was it,&quot; Ditka wrote. &quot;He didn&apos;t spare the rod.&quot; Ditka&apos;s autobiography is filled with phrases like &quot;worst beating of my life.&quot; &quot;If I didn&apos;t [do what he said],&quot; wrote Ditka, &quot;he gave me a hard time. By a hard time, I mean he simply whipped my ass.&quot; Such poundings usually came in response to some bit of mischief. A neighbor once described young Mike Ditka as &quot;a high intensity boy.&quot; On one occasion, experimenting with cigarettes, he burned down a stand of trees behind the family house. When Ditka&apos;s father came home, he wondered what had happened &quot;to the forest.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.2"> &quot;Ask your son,&quot; his wife told him.</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.3"> &quot;I got nailed,&quot; Ditka wrote. &quot;He had an old leather Marine belt. It was probably the hardest whipping I ever got.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.5"> Some people, you see a picture of them taken in third or fourth grade, you have no idea who it is. Of course, when you&apos;re told, the features reassemble themselves in a familiar way and you think, Oh yeah, now I see my friend. But with Ditka, you know right away: the chipmunk cheeks and broad forehead, the mouth turned fiercely down, the amused glint, the peaked, bearlike hairline&#x2014;it was all there from the start. And the smile. Mike Ditka has a great smile. It wrinkles his cheeks and makes his eyes vanish. It&apos;s a cute smile, surprisingly adorable in an otherwise tough face. In fact, it&apos;s so cute it&apos;s scary. If a bear smiled at you, that would be scary, too. You see a thing like that in the woods, you think, I&apos;m done.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.6"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c3721177d66d68d57894/master/w_806/sports-2013-10-mike-ditka-aliquippa-pennsylvania.jpg" alt="sports-2013-10-mike-ditka-aliquippa-pennsylvania.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmike-ditka-rich-cohen-monsters-chicago-bears&amp;t=sports-2013-10-mike-ditka-aliquippa-pennsylvania.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmike-ditka-rich-cohen-monsters-chicago-bears&amp;t=sports-2013-10-mike-ditka-aliquippa-pennsylvania.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmike-ditka-rich-cohen-monsters-chicago-bears&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c3721177d66d68d57894%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fsports-2013-10-mike-ditka-aliquippa-pennsylvania.jpg&amp;description=sports-2013-10-mike-ditka-aliquippa-pennsylvania.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmike-ditka-rich-cohen-monsters-chicago-bears&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c3721177d66d68d57894%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fsports-2013-10-mike-ditka-aliquippa-pennsylvania.jpg&amp;description=sports-2013-10-mike-ditka-aliquippa-pennsylvania.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.7"> Ditka grew up in the 1940s and 1950s, a boom time for Aliquippa and places like it, hardscrabble towns in Appalachia, where refineries churned out steel for the battleships and fighter planes to defeat the Communists. Main Street was filled with life&#x2014;candy stores, the men&apos;s shop, the five-and-dine, the union hall, the saloon, parades and banners, excited talk about the high school football game against Beaver Falls. The slums were at the bottom of the valley, in the shadow of the mill, tin roofs, sagging porches, old men in undershirts, smoking cigarettes and drinking beer. &quot;It was a very ethnic area,&quot; Ditka wrote, &quot;which was also very prejudiced. Whether you were a Polack or a Hunky or a Jew or a Dago or a Wop or a Cake-eater or Colored&#x2014;we didn&apos;t use the other slang word for blacks&#x2014;it was prejudiced.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.8"> The rich people lived up the hill&#x2014;the more you had, the higher you got, until you reached the mansions built into the ridgeline, from where you could see other valleys where other factories spewed smoke, prejudice, and gridiron heroes. It was the kingdom of football, the breeding ground of so many of the players who defined the game: Bednarik, Unitas, Montana, Marino, Namath&#x2014;the list is ridiculous. When I asked Ditka why so many great players came from western Pennsylvania, he said, &quot;It&apos;s the work ethic, the way people were brought up. The parents came from the old country and worked in the mills and the mines. People didn&apos;t have anything but didn&apos;t need anything. They were tough. Were they tougher than they were in Nebraska? I don&apos;t know. But they were tough.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.9"> Ditka spent his free time playing games in the weeds between the houses. Basketball, baseball, mob ball. He was a bad loser from the beginning. If things went wrong, he went nuts, stormed off, stormed back, threw a bat, chucked a ball, hit a guy, stormed off again, came back again, hit someone else. He was made for football. It became increasingly obvious as he got older. He was a late bloomer, small his first years at Aliquippa High School, but this just added intensity to size when he finally grew in his junior year. He credits everything to his high school coach, Carl Aschman, whom he ranks with the other great coaches of his life: George Halas and Tom Landry. Ditka played every position in high school&#x2014;offensive line, running back, linebacker, punter&#x2014;but mostly he was just out there kicking ass. Later, speaking of why he loved football, he said, &quot;When you step onto the football field, everybody&apos;s equal. And when you step off, everybody&apos;s not equal anymore. Somebody&apos;s won and somebody&apos;s lost. Somebody&apos;s dominated and somebody&apos;s been dominated. Somebody&apos;s taught and somebody&apos;s learned.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.a"> Aliquippa won the Pennsylvania State Championship in 1955, with Ditka playing both ways, a mill town all star. He was recruited by Jim Finks at Notre Dame&#x2014;Finks was the Bears general manager when Ditka took over as coach&#x2014;and Joe Paterno at Penn State, but chose Pitt for its premed program. Ditka planned on being a dentist after football&#x2014;imagine those giant fingers rooting around your mouth. By 1959, he&apos;d become one of the best college players in the nation. He played linebacker on defense and fullback on offense. He was quick, hard-hitting, and mean, but his hands were what made him special. It was rare for a big man to have such soft hands. Pitt did not throw often, but when they did go to Ditka, he almost always made the catch. And after he made it, he was nearly impossible to bring down. A player that size running in the open was a new development, so new most pro scouts hardly took notice. It was assumed that Ditka would play defense in the NFL, where his soft hands would help him make interceptions.</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.b"> When the Bears drafted Ditka first in 1961, it was with another idea in mind. Halas and his assistant, George Allen, wanted to put Ditka on the offensive line. He would block on most plays but now and then skirt away from the trenches, head downfield ten or fifteen yards, turn around, and catch a pass. Winning football games is not about pitting strength against strength, speed against speed. It&apos;s about finding a mismatch, a situation in which their little guy has to tackle your monster, or their monster has to chase your sprinter. If Ditka got downfield, he&apos;d be covered by defensive backs half his size. It was a strategy made possible only by Ditka&apos;s special gift: Big guys almost never had such soft hands. In this way, Halas created what has since become a dominant weapon in the NFL: Mike Ditka was the first modern tight end. &quot;Nobody threw to the tight end back then,&quot; he told me. &quot;He was just another guy on the line of scrimmage, next to the tackle. Then Halas had this idea to throw me the ball. He realized it was hard for me to get off the line when I was next to the tackle, so he moved me three or four yards down. I was the first tight end to flex out.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Ditka was twenty-one when he arrived at training camp. He had also been drafted by the Houston Oilers of the new American Football League, but his dream had always been to play in the NFL. His first contract paid him $12,000 plus a $6,000 signing bonus, which George Allen said was the &quot;biggest contract we&apos;ve paid anyone since Red Grange.&quot; When Ditka brought the agreement home to Aliquippa, his father looked it over, frowned in a slightly disapproving way, and said, &quot;Most men have to work a long time to get that kind of money.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Ditka had the hands but caught the ball in the untutored way of the sandlot. Turning what you&apos;ve always done by instinct into a practice, a trade&#x2014;that&apos;s what makes you a professional. Halas brought Sid Luckman back to work with Ditka, teach him the proper way to catch. Sid was forty-four years old, gray, soft, ancient, a figure of lore. He had a method, a way to concentrate the rookie. He gathered a pile of footballs and wrote a number on each: 27, 61, 33. Ditka ran pattern after pattern. As soon as he made a catch, he had to call out the number on the ball. This would teach him the art of high focus: just you and the ball, watching it all the way into your hands. In 1961, Ditka caught 56 passes for 1,076 yards. He scored twelve touchdowns. No tight end had ever done anything like it. He was named Rookie of the Year and made the Pro Bowl, an honor he would secure in each of his first four seasons.</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.e"> It was not just the statistics that earned Ditka respect&#x2014;it was how he played, the fierceness of his game. He answered every challenge, returned every insult. He tore it up. In his fifth game, the Bears played the Baltimore Colts, where Ditka faced Bill Pellington, one of the toughest linebackers in football. He&apos;d knocked the Lions&apos; tight end Jim Gibbons out not long before. &quot;So all week all I heard was how tough Bill Pellington was and how he was going to knock the crap out of me,&quot; Ditka wrote later. &quot;Well, I lined up on the first play from scrimmage and by God they were right. He punched me right in the mouth. I wore that little, thin bar [on my helmet] that didn&apos;t protect anything. He punched me right in the mouth and I said, &apos;Oh. Boy.&apos; On the next play&#x2014; I don&apos;t know what the play was&#x2014;didn&apos;t matter. I didn&apos;t even care. I don&apos;t know if it was a pass play or a run. I just gave him a head fake, drew back and punched him as hard as I could.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.f"> In Green Bay, Ditka battled Packers Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Nitschke on the field and off. One night, after a rough game, they ran into each other in a restaurant. They started jawing back and forth. Then Nitschke pointed a big finger in Ditka&apos;s face and said, &quot;I&apos;m going to get you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.g"> &quot;If you get me, you better get me good,&quot; said Ditka. &quot;One thing in life you&apos;ve got to remember is if you&apos;re trying to get somebody, you don&apos;t get got.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.h"> Ditka was guided by a code, a slightly demented sense of football right and wrong. In the third quarter of a game in Los Angeles, a drunken fan dashed onto the field. The cops pursued. The crowd roared. It used to happen a lot: a drunk running higgledy piggledy as police fell all over themselves. As he crossed midfield, Ditka stepped out of the huddle and ended it with a single blow. The guy went up, turned over in the air, then dropped lifelessly to the ground. He looked dead. It was sickening&#x2014;a butterfly meets a tank. Explaining why he did it after the game, Ditka could have been summing up his entire philosophy: &quot;Because that guy&apos;s got no fucking right to be on the field! The field is for players!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.i"> Ditka played his first NFL game in Minneapolis against the expansion Vikings. He earned notice from the veterans right away. A rookie is supposed to be quiet in the huddle, but Ditka cursed everyone out for letting the game slip away. Losing to an expansion team is a particular kind of ignominy. The plane was quiet going home, the Convair 320 rumbling through the dark. Halas came on the PA: &quot;I want to say just one thing to you guys. You&apos;re nothing but a bunch of cunts!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.j"> Halas taught Ditka the game: how to play, how to coach, when to praise, when to call the boys a bunch of cunts. Watching him operate was better than ten years in school. He was a wizard, a pioneer, but it was his attention to detail that really impressed. I mean, here was this guy, a founder of the NFL, a standout for Coach Zuppke, a man who stripped the ball from Jim Thorpe, and what&apos;s he doing at age sixty-six? Weighing every kid on the roster, standing by with a clipboard, stopwatch, and pen. &quot;Nobody weighed anybody except him,&quot; Ditka said. &quot;He didn&apos;t trust anyone. We had to do it twice a week.&quot; It was a $23 fine for every pound over. &quot;The most fun anybody even had was the weigh-in. They used to trick the scales. The old man would go crazy. One guy would get on and another guy would put his finger under the cheek of his ass. Another guy would get on the scale with weights in his jockstrap.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.k"> Halas personally negotiated every contract. No lawyers, no agents, just you and the old man, eyeball to eyeball across the desk. &quot;Halas embarrassed you,&quot; Ditka wrote. &quot;Ripped you apart. After I signed my first contract for $12,000 plus that $6,000 bonus, I made Rookie of the Year and All-Pro. I came back and he offered me $14,000. I said, &apos;Coach, you&apos;re making a mistake. I made $18,000 last year. You&apos;re giving me a $4,000 cut.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.l"> &quot;How do you figure you made $18,000?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.m"> &quot;Twelve plus six is eighteen.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.n"> &quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;The six was a bonus, remember? The bonus doesn&apos;t count.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.o"> Ditka begged and pleaded until Halas agreed to bump him up to $18,000, then reached into his desk and brought out a contract already made out in that amount.</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.p">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.q"> The Bears had floundered in the seasons since Sid Luckman retired. That&apos;s what happens when a dynasty collapses: the palace falls to ruins, the countryside is plunged into darkness. When Ditka was drafted, it had been fifteen years since the team played for a championship. His arrival marked a crucial step on the way back. He gave the Bears a new spirit. They were better in 1961 than they&apos;d been in 1960, and still better in 1962. By 1963, they were ready to make a title run. In addition to Ditka, there was linebacker Bill George, quarterback Bill Wade, running back Willie Galimore, defensive tackle Doug Atkins. Mike Pyle played center, a nasty position: you start the play with the snap, then get hit in the head. In the old days, before it was banned, the defensive player lined up across from the center&#x2014;the noseguard&#x2014;and often reared back and slapped the center on the ear, knocking him silly.</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.r"> Mike Pyle was unusual. Most pros come from waste places, mill cities and industrial towns. But Pyle grew up in Winnetka, on Chicago&apos;s North Shore. His father was an ecutive at Kraft Foods. Mike went to Yale, where he was tapped by Skull &amp; Bones. (Yalies of that era still speak of the Pyle brothers with awe.) I took a special interest in Pyle because we went to the same high school, New Trier, which has turned out lots of bankers, doctors, actors, and politicians&#x2014;Charlton Heston, Rock Hudson, Donald Rumsfeld&#x2014;but few professional athletes. We&apos;re the candy-asses by the lake. It made Pyle seem a kind of wonder, a New Trier Indian who&apos;d gone all the way. He spoke at a pep rally my senior year. There is a picture of it in my yearbook. He was still a big man, straining the stitches of his suit, bearded, with thick wrists. He was forty-seven, forty-eight, the age that I am now, but I feel the same age as always, whereas he seemed so much older. I can&apos;t recall a word he said, but I do remember how he looked, the way he carried himself. He pounded the lectern as the high school football coach nodded at his side. He was like Hemingway returning to Oak Park High in a cape, unbuttoning his tunic to show the seniors his scars. I asked Ditka about Pyle: What&apos;s he up to now? The coach crossed his arms, looked at me. &quot;I love Mike, but he&apos;s not doing well,&quot; he said. &quot;You know, in my day, the helmets were not the best, just a piece of plastic, and the center got pounded, slapped in the head all game. I used to talk to Mike every week but it&apos;s been a long time since he&apos;s called.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.s">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.t"> The &apos;63 Bears opened with a string of victories. By late November, the fate of the season hung on a game against the Steelers. That Friday, as the players were packing, word came over the radio: President Kennedy had been shot in Dallas. A few hours later, when the first reports were followed by news of the president&apos;s death, the country was plunged into black sorrow. Everyone assumed the game would be canceled. The American Football League canceled everything, but NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle said the games would go on, a decision he later regretted. The Bears did not want to play: How do you gin up the fury? How do you convince yourself it matters? &quot;We wanted no part of it,&quot; Ditka told me. &quot;We&apos;re Americans first and we were destroyed, but we&apos;re soldiers, too. They tell us to play, we play. Then, of course, you get out there and get popped in the mouth, and the world disappears and there is only the game.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.u"> November 24, 1963: the emperor lay dead in the capital but the gladiators carried on at the Forum. The game was played at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh in front of a glowering crowd of drunks who should have been somewhere else. Before the coin toss, Halas got his team in a circle and said, &quot;We&apos;re going to play this game to get people&apos;s minds off the assassination.&quot; Late in the fourth quarter, the Bears were down 17&#x2013;14. If they lost, no championship. Clouds rolled in from the west. Billy Wade took the snap. Ditka went upfield, hit a linebacker, turned, looked at the ball all the way in, caught it, tucked it, and headed for the end zone, the burner&apos;s son running under an inky sky. He had about seventy yards to go. Every time a Steeler came up to make the stop, Ditka would bring his big forearm around. He broke tackle after tackle, leaving the wounded in his wake. He was finally brought down by defensive back Clendon Thomas deep in Pittsburgh territory. He&apos;d gone fifty yard after the catch. He lay on the field spent, an burned out engine. In Chicago, they called it &quot;the run.&quot; &quot;That was the luckiest run in the world,&quot; Ditka said. &quot;It was a combination of me being tired, them being tireder, and poor tackling. It was terrible.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.v"> The Bears kicker Roger Leclerc hit an eighteen-yard field goal to tie the game. Pittsburgh got the ball back with seconds left, ran a play, then another, then before anyone realized what was happening, a Steelers&apos; receiver was going downfield for a touchdown. He crossed the goal line and raised his arms, but at some point, way back there, impossible to hear above the crowd, a whistle had been blown. The play was no good though no one was sure why. In the meantime, the last second had run off the clock. It was over. A murmur went through the crowd: <em>Halas paid off the refs! He bought the fuckin&apos; thing!</em> The drunkest fans came over the wall. It was a mob. The refs blew their whistles but were quickly overwhelmed. The Bears got their coach and raced through a storm of beer cans. They got to the locker room and shut the door only to realize a Pittsburgh reporter had followed them inside. He was waving his notebook in the old man&apos;s face, cursing, <em>You bought it, you evil bastard, you bought it, didn&apos;t you?</em> For a long moment, Halas stared into the face of the reporter as a you stare into a garbage compacter that will not turn, wondering, <em>what the hell is down there?</em> His eyes flashed, but before he could move, Ditka had the reporter and was carrying him through the locker room and dumping him in the hall. He slammed the door. It got quiet. They stared at each other. Someone turned on a TV. Cronkite or Brinkley. What he was saying made no sense: the man who&apos;d shot the president had himself been shot in a garage in Dallas.</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.w"> The NFL Title Game was played in Wrigley Field. The Giants were led by the Hall of Fame quarterback Y. A. Tittle. One of those ancients who seemed to play forever&#x2014;he was thirty-seven when he faced the Bears in the championship&#x2014;Tittle was the subject of perhaps the greatest sports photo ever taken. It shows him on his knees on the turf. His helmet has been knocked off, blood trickles from his head. Beaten and old, the gladiator suffers stoically. The final score was Bears 14, Giants 10. &quot;I guess today&apos;s game proves that if you live long enough, everything you want to happen will happen,&quot; Halas said. He was named Coach of the Year. He was sixty-eight. It was the last time he&apos;d see the Bears win a championship.</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.x">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.y"> &quot;Why didn&apos;t you repeat?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.z"> &quot;What&apos;s that?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.10"> &quot;Why didn&apos;t your championship team repeat?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oo1q2jur5s.1.1.0.0.4.11"> This was me talking to Ditka over dinner one night.
