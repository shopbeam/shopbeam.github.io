It\u0027s the feeling that the shadowy monster might actually be real....\u000A\u000A I wanted the audience to feel like they had a pair of hands wrapped\u000A gently around their neck that they couldn\u0027t shake, and that grip kept\u000A getting tighter and tighter until they couldn\u0027t breathe. And then an\u000A explosion of everything crushing down on them. Suspense has more to do\u000A with musicality and the rhythm that music contains. (Carpenter films\u000A influenced me so much.) I wanted to be relentless and not let up on\u000A the audience. Jennifer Kent, Writer/Director\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ABONUS! John Carpenter on spooky sounds:\u000A\u000A\u0022I composed my own music because we didn\u0027t have any money to hire\u000Aanyone. When I wrote the theme from Halloween, it was a rhythm my\u000Adad taught me on bongos. I just walked it up an octave on piano, then\u000Ait modulates. There\u0027s no more to it than that. It\u0027s repetitive.\u000ARepetitive stuff makes you tense.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: IFC Midnight/ Everett Collection\u000A\u000AWhat makes Freaks (1932) frightening at a more primitive level than other horror flicks is its cast: The deformed circus performers who act out their revenge on a beautiful but callous trapeze artist (Olga Baclanova) were real sideshow attractions, from \u0022Half Boy\u0022 Johnny Eckwhose miniature body ended at the waistto Siamese twins Daisy and Violet Hilton. We know they\u0027re being exploited for sensationalism\u0027s sake, but that\u0027s how they earned a living in those rubbernecking times; in its opportunistic, semi-documentary way, Tod Browning\u0027s film preserved a carny subculture that nobody belonged to by choice. The frequently crude filmmaking, artless dialogue, and tinny soundtrack augment the queasy effect, but there\u0027s nothing inept about the movie\u0027s showpiece sequences: the \u0022wedding feast\u0022 that celebrates Baclanova\u0027s gruesome marriage to a dapper dwarf (future Wizard of Oz Lollipop Guild Member Harry Earles) and the terrifying climax, when the freaks stalk their prey in a rainstorm. If Freaks doesn\u0027t give you the heebie-jeebies, not much will. Tom Carson\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Everett Collection\u000A\u000AWhat Could Possibly Scare The Creator Of The Human Centipede?\u000A\u000AWell, to me, films like Sleepless in\u000ASeattle are extreme\u000Ahorror. The sugary ending with Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, and the little kid\u000Aon the rooftop of the Empire State Building is nightmarish. Happy\u000Aendings only exist at Amsterdam massage parlors. Tom Six\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: MGM/Everett Collection\u000A\u000APoltergeist (1982) is lodged in the collective cultural memory as a kiddie-scare flick with an adorable catchphrase. But it\u0027s actually a rare example of a fiendishly efficient all-ages horror movie, blending the stuff that frightens kids (thunderstorms, monsters in the closet, clown dolls) with the stuff that frightens mortgage-holders (children in peril, sudden collapses in property values, clown dolls). It\u0027s effectively a war movie about a family defending itself against an uprising of lost souls, and part of its genius is that the battlefield isn\u0027t, say, a creaky Gothic mansion or a haunted hotel complex in winter but a cookie-cutter suburban-California house where even the most mundane objectsthe TV set, chairs around the kitchen tablecan be recruited to the dark side. Jessica Winter\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: 20th Century Fox/The Kobal Collection\u000A\u000AWHAT COULD POSSIBLY SCARE O. J. SIMPSON?\u000A\u000AYou want to have fun while you\u0027re being scared. Like a roller\u000Acoaster ride, your heart should be in your mouth but you need to be\u000Astrapped in tightly. The biggest Oh my God!-scary movie is Alien. I\u000Awatched it at an industry screening two rows behind O. J. Simpson.\u000AThat moment where the alien comes out of the guy\u0027s stomach took me out\u000Aof my chair. I would\u0027ve been embarrassed if Simpson hadn\u0027t jumped much\u000Ahigher and much faster. If it could scare the Juice, I was okay.\u000ASean Cunningham, Director, Friday The 13th\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Warner Bros/ Everett Collection\u000A\u000A The Blair Witch Project (1999) gave me nightmares for about a year. It still causes major problems in my personal relationship with Joshua Leonard, one of the movie\u0027s stars. I have a hard time being around him whenever he\u0027s facing a corner. Like, We can hang out; you just gotta stay in the middle of the fucking room, dude. That image was ingrained in my subconscious forever. The feeling behind the movie was very realistic. Something about the way the movie is shot, with the lo-fi camera, gave a bit of intimacy to it all. It was just unique and unsettling. There was no thinking; it was mostly just urinating. Mark Duplass, Actor/Filmmaker\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Everett Collection\u000A\u000AHoly crap, The Exorcist (1973). I was 14 when I saw it, permanently scarred for life. Thereafter, for many years, I wouldn\u0027t, couldn\u0027t, be left alone in a room at night. My bad dreams revolved around scenes in the movie, of green puke and the voice of Beelzebub, saying really really inappropriate stuff. If I became feverish, I was pretty sure it was Pazuzuthe evil spirit who inhabits Linda Blaircome to mess me up. And Ouija boards? Forget it! But the real horror is the horrible realization that darkness may really win out over good, that our universe is bursting at the seams with violence and entropy. It\u0027s the horror of a really sweet, loving, decent kidjust like all of us, for fuck\u0027s sake!suddenly turned against her mother and a bunch of priests, even, with such rabid malevolence that there seems no justice in the world. It\u0027s the horror of possession and the proximity of chaos and a glimmer of that unconscious force that might unravel all of us. The Exorcist is a game of chicken for our souls, and you know from early on, that someone\u0027s gonna end up dead. You just keeping hoping it won\u0027t be you. Michael Paterniti\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Stanley Bielecki Movie Collection/Getty Images\u000A\u000AEasily the most traumatizing aspect of The Omen (1976) is what it sounds like. It\u0027s a noisy film replete with bloodcurdling screamsbut what really gets under your skin is the cacophony of dog attacks, baboon creeches, and sheer ghoulishness of happy kids shrieking and then going silent for the ropy recoil of a noose. Zero suspension of disbelief required. It was to me entirely plausible that Lucifer\u0027s son was a podgy English boy in a spread-collar, bell-bottom pile-fabric suit, and a kid being diabolical scared me as a non-practicing baby Catholic. I was trapped in the catch-22 of believing in hell just enough to think that doubting it all would send me there. Mary H.K. Choi\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Mary Evans/ Ronald Grant/ Everett Collection\u000A\u000AI showed Who Can Kill a Child? (a.k.a. Island of the Damned; 1976) to Quentin Tarantino, and he said it was the best horror movie that he hadn\u0027t seen before. It\u0027s like a Hitchcock moviebrilliant and so simple. A guy and his pregnant wife go on vacation to this island off the coast of Spain; they get there, and the adults are gone. Just very, very creepy kids. They realize that something infected the kids and they all went crazy, killed the adults. So he\u0027s got to defend himself, but how do you kill a 3-year-old kid? Like, you can\u0027t. It\u0027s your instinct to protect children, but these are amazing killer kids. There\u0027s a scene where they\u0027re trapped in a jail cell, and they look up, and there\u0027s a 3-year-old, and he\u0027s got a gun and starts pointing it at the couple in the jail cell. And the kid\u0027s just smiling. Totally nuts. Eli Roth, Writer/Director, Hostel, Cabin Fever\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Everett Collection\u000A\u000AThe films that have really scared me give me the feeling that whoever made it is dangerous and crazy. Like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). I really, literally, thought that was made by a Manson Family-like group in Texas somewhere. As a filmmaker, you have to cross those lines, as I did in my first couple of films to the point where people spurned my company. The audience has to feel like the director is dangerous: He crossed lines he shouldn\u0027t cross, and he might put anything up on the screen. Wes Craven, Filmmaker, Scream series, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The Last House On The Left\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADavid Lynch taps into something unexplainable. Like the scene in Mulholland Dr. where two people meet up in a diner in the middle of the day and one of the guys describes his dreams to the other guy. It\u0027s one of the scariest scenes ever committed to film, but it shouldn\u0027t be. Nothing about that scene should be scary at all. Lynch is able to tap into something that\u0027s scary for human beings: fear of the unknown. A big clich about Lynch is that his films are dreamlike, but it\u0027s true. Dreams follow weird logic. Lynch\u0027s films are like that: feels like a nightmare. Leigh Whannell, Writer, Saw and Insidious series\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Everett Collection\u000A\u000AIn 1974, with the bad half of a marijuana cigarette in me, I experienced this film on Hollywood Boulevard that just rocks my world: Sisters (1973) plays on the fear of Siamese twins. The Brian De Palma film stars Margot Kidder, in French-Canadian lushness. And there\u0027s a phenomenal mad doctor played by William Finley. He\u0027s like a giant sweating grasshopper. It\u0027s just an incredible performance; he literally cuts the Siamese twins in half so that he can fuck one of them. That\u0027s what he\u0027s after. I would love to see it correctly projected, although I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a Blu-ray out. It would look great on a fifty-inch flat-screen with curvature in the goddamn man cave. Robert Englund, Actor (Freddy Krueger)\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Universal/The Kobal Collection\u000A\u000AI jumped up and ran screaming to the back of the theater but eventually sat back down, because I was fascinated. Horrified, but fascinated. I saw It Came from Outer Space (1953) in 3-D, which was not a good thing for a young kid. A meteor (we find out later it\u0027s a spaceship) streaks across the desert night sky. Cut to an angle where the burning ball of fire comes hurtling straight into the camera and explodes. I didn\u0027t understand anything. Why is this meteor blowing up in my face? Horror works best when you\u0027re young, when we have these imaginations that are still very active. As you get older, your knowledge of your own limits, and of death, sometimes takes away from horror\u0027s appeal. John Carpenter, Creator, Halloween\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Universal/The Kobal Collection\u000A\u000AThe reason I made Young Frankenstein was because when I was 5 or 6 years old, I was scared out of my wits by James Whale\u0027s Frankenstein. I could not get images of Boris Karloff\u0027s face out of my head. I would see him in every alley and around every dark corner. One very hot night in July, I asked my mother to close my bedroom window. In Brooklyn in 1931, there was no such thing as air-conditioning. I explained that Frankenstein (that is what we mistakenly called The Monster) was out to get me! And since my bedroom window was on the fire escape, it would be easy for him to climb up and crush me like a bug. My mother patiently explained that he would have to crawl out of his burning cellar in Transylvania and find the money to buy a railway ticket to get a train to take him to Hamburg. He would then have to raise the money to buy a boat ticket to get from Hamburg to New York City. When he landed in New York, he would have to find the right subway train to take him to Brooklyn. He would have to ask a lot of people to find out where I lived, and she was sure nobody would tell him. I said, \u0022Okay, leave the window open!\u0022 And that\u0027s why I\u0027m alive today. Mel Brooks\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Universal/The Kobal Collection\u000A\u000AI remember really being scared by, of all movies, Halloween III: Season of the Witch , which has a horrible subplot about a deranged mask manufacturer, Silver Shamrock, who, for some reason, on a Halloween has designed these masks that you can pick up at any drugstore. They bombard the United States with advertisements about buying these masks for your kids: Wear \u0027em on Halloween! But this guy has put in chipsthis is so absurd I can\u0027t even explain itwhich I think he got from Stonehenge. On Halloween night, these chips get activated and fill kids\u0027 heads with beetles, crickets, and snakes, and your entire head becomes this pulsating mass with beetles and crickets and snakes. The first time I saw it in a theater I said, \u0022The most awful thing I\u0027ve ever seen.\u0022 Bret Easton Ellis, Author, American Psycho\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Royal Films international / Neal Peters Collection\u000A\u000ARepulsion is a psychological drama, but it\u0027s the scariest movie I\u0027ve ever seen. It\u0027s about a woman\u0027s descent into madness. It\u0027s done quietly but creepily. She sees hands coming out of the wall and a guy breaking into her room. It gets under your skin. Roman Polanski knows the buttons to push. You feel like you\u0027re going crazy yourself. George Romero, Director, Night Of The Living Dead\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve had crazy blonde girlfriends, and this focuses on the psychology behind a psychotic blonde who is, you know, repulsed by sex and by men, so she does the unthinkable. I married a brunette. Nick Carter, Singer, The Backstreet Boys\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Mary Evans/Ronald Grant/Everett Collection\u000A\u000AThe Scariest Movie You Don\u0027t Actually Want to Watch\u000A\u000AIt goes beyond any bounds of good taste: It\u0027s so violent, so bloody, so nasty. The thing I remember the most is a scene where they kill a huge river turtle. No way is that entertaining in any way. You can see it\u0027s real. They rip the shell off, you know, they kill it all on camera, and it\u0027s just horrible. And then they move right from that to other people doing things that are obviously fake, but just as nasty and brutally violent. It\u0027s the closest thing you\u0027re going to get to watching a snuff film, other than actually watching a snuff film if they actually exist. So yeah, there\u0027s the feel-bad movie of your fall: Cannibal Holocaust (1980).  Rob Zombie, Writer/Director, House Of 1000 Corpses\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHEADFriday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989): Jason punches a guy so hard his head flies off.EYEBALLUn Chien Andalou (1929): In the opening scene, a man holds a razor up to a woman\u0027s eye.

Eye-guts spill out.STOMACHAlien (1979): You\u0027ve seen this one.SPINESpecies (1995): Beautiful but deadly monstress Natasha Henstridge follows a woman into a nightclub bathroom and rips out her spine.ARM127 Hours (2010): Contains frightfully realistic gore.

Harder and harder it claws. What\u0027s going to happen? The worst thing: Fingernail snaps off and skitters across the floor.VEINSA Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987): Freddy Krueger wakes up a puppet-maker by slicing open his arms and legs, tugging on his veins like marionette strings, and making him walk out an open window.ACHILLES TENDONPet Sematary (1989): Zombie boy sneaks up on Fred Gwynne, the kindly old neighbor, and excruciatingly slices into his Achilles tendon. Gwynne goes down, and the boy eats his throat.TOELake Placid (1999): A giant crocodile eats a scuba diver, and all that remains is his left big toe. Bill Pullman finds it on the shore of the lake.DONGCannibal Holocaust(1980): In an entirely convincing scene that\u0027s impossible to watch twice, a guy gets his penis sliced right offI think. I lost consciousness.BALLSPlanet Terror (2007): Abby has an unexplained obsession with cutting off his enemies\u0027 goolies, which he carries around with him in a jar.CLITORISAntichrist (2009): Nothing happens here. Nope, nothing at all.FOOTSaw (2004): Just one of the body parts cut off in this movie.ANKLEMisery (1990): Superfan Kathy Bates loves a novelist so much that she shoves a block of wood between his feet and smashes his ankles with a sledgehammer.LEGSShaun of the Dead (2004): In a tribute scene to Day of the Dead, Simon Pegg\u0027s priggish frenemy David gets dragged through a pub window and disemboweled by zombies. Pegg &amp; Co. accidentally rip David\u0027s legs off, trying to save him.ENTIRE BODYVideodrome (1983): James Woods, a hallucinating human VCR, guns down a sinister TV executive.

His jaw falls off. Then the rest of him.TONGUEBlood Feast (1963): The gore is explicit but ineptly done, which for some reason makes it all the more disturbing. See: the scene in which the lead cannibal rips out a woman\u0027s tongue.SCALP\u000A\u000AManiac (2012): Elijah\u000AWood plays a serial killer who scalps his victims.

We know they&#x2019;re being exploited for sensationalism&#x2019;s sake, but that&#x2019;s how they earned a living in those rubbernecking times; in its opportunistic, semi-documentary way, Tod Browning&#x2019;s film preserved a carny subculture that nobody belonged to by choice. The frequently crude filmmaking, artless dialogue, and tinny soundtrack augment the queasy effect, but there&#x2019;s nothing inept about the movie&#x2019;s showpiece sequences: the &quot;wedding feast&quot; that celebrates Baclanova&#x2019;s gruesome marriage to a dapper dwarf (future <em>Wizard of Oz </em>Lollipop Guild Member Harry Earles) and the terrifying climax, when the freaks stalk their prey in a rainstorm. If <em>Freaks </em>doesn&#x2019;t give you the heebie-jeebies, not much will. <strong></strong><strong>Tom Carson</strong></p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.c"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bBXyB7niEc0" height="315" width="420"></iframe></div></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.d"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.e"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55931aec7dbd34d650ec8714/master/w_806/entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-sleepless-in-seattle.jpg" alt="entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-sleepless-in-seattle.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-sleepless-in-seattle.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-sleepless-in-seattle.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aec7dbd34d650ec8714%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-sleepless-in-seattle.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-sleepless-in-seattle.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aec7dbd34d650ec8714%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-sleepless-in-seattle.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-sleepless-in-seattle.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Everett Collection</div></figcaption></figure></div><div class="embed h1" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.f"><h1>What Could Possibly Scare The Creator Of <em>The Human Centipede</em>?</h1></div><div class="embed blockquote" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.g"><blockquote><p>Well, to me, films like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeY1mkXqKgk"><em>Sleepless in

But it&#x2019;s actually a rare example of a fiendishly efficient all-ages horror movie, blending the stuff that frightens kids (thunderstorms, monsters in the closet, clown dolls) with the stuff that frightens mortgage-holders (children in peril, sudden collapses in property values, clown dolls). It&#x2019;s effectively a war movie about a family defending itself against an uprising of lost souls, and part of its genius is that the battlefield isn&#x2019;t, say, a creaky Gothic mansion or a haunted hotel complex in winter but a cookie-cutter suburban-California house where even the most mundane objectsthe TV set, chairs around the kitchen tablecan be recruited to the dark side. <strong>Jessica Winter</strong></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.k"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55931af27dbd34d650ec876b/master/w_806/wp-content-uploads-2014-05-poltergeisthand.gif" alt="wp-content-uploads-2014-05-poltergeisthand.gif"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=wp-content-uploads-2014-05-poltergeisthand.gif"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=wp-content-uploads-2014-05-poltergeisthand.gif" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931af27dbd34d650ec876b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fwp-content-uploads-2014-05-poltergeisthand.gif&amp;description=wp-content-uploads-2014-05-poltergeisthand.gif"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931af27dbd34d650ec876b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fwp-content-uploads-2014-05-poltergeisthand.gif&amp;description=wp-content-uploads-2014-05-poltergeisthand.gif" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.l"><hr></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.m"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55931aedd804e2df1837bf67/master/w_600/entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-alien-1979.jpg" alt="entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-alien-1979.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-alien-1979.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-alien-1979.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aedd804e2df1837bf67%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-alien-1979.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-alien-1979.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aedd804e2df1837bf67%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-alien-1979.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-alien-1979.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: 20th Century Fox/The Kobal Collection</div></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="embed h1" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.n"><h1><strong>WHAT COULD POSSIBLY SCARE O.

Like, <em>We can hang out; you just gotta stay in the middle of the fucking room, dude.</em> That image was ingrained in my subconscious forever. The feeling behind the movie was very realistic. Something about the way the movie is shot, with the lo-fi camera, gave a bit of intimacy to it all. It was just unique and unsettling.

(1973). I was 14 when I saw it, permanently scarred for life. Thereafter, for many years, I wouldn&#x2019;t, couldn&#x2019;t, be left alone in a room at night. My bad dreams revolved around scenes in the movie, of green puke and the voice of Beelzebub, saying really <em>really</em> inappropriate stuff. If I became feverish, I was pretty sure it was Pazuzuthe evil spirit who inhabits Linda Blaircome to mess me up. And Ouija boards? Forget it! But the real horror is the horrible realization that darkness may really win out over good, that our universe is bursting at the seams with violence and entropy. It&#x2019;s the horror of a really sweet, loving, decent kidjust like all of us, for fuck&#x2019;s sake!suddenly turned against her mother and a bunch of priests, even, with such rabid malevolence that there seems no justice in the world. It&#x2019;s the horror of possession and the proximity of chaos and a glimmer of that unconscious force that might unravel all of us. <em>The Exorcist</em> is a game of chicken for our souls, and you know from early on, that someone&#x2019;s gonna end up dead. You just keeping hoping it won&#x2019;t be you. <strong>Michael Paterniti</strong></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.y"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.z"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55931aeed804e2df1837bf6f/master/w_806/entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-omen.jpg" alt="entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-omen.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-omen.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-omen.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aeed804e2df1837bf6f%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-omen.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-omen.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aeed804e2df1837bf6f%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-omen.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-omen.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Stanley Bielecki Movie Collection/Getty Images</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.10">Easily the most traumatizing aspect of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABfS-H1xmE"><strong><em>The Omen</em></strong></a> (1976) is what it <em>sounds</em> like. It&#x2019;s a noisy film replete with bloodcurdling screamsbut what really gets under your skin is the cacophony of dog attacks, baboon creeches, and sheer ghoulishness of happy kids shrieking and then going silent for the ropy recoil of a noose. Zero suspension of disbelief required. It was to me entirely plausible that Lucifer&#x2019;s son was a podgy English boy in a spread-collar, bell-bottom pile-fabric suit, and a kid being diabolical scared me as a non-practicing baby Catholic. I was trapped in the catch-22 of believing in hell <em>just enough</em> to think that doubting it all would send me there. <strong>Mary H.K.

It&#x2019;s like a Hitchcock moviebrilliant and so simple. A guy and his pregnant wife go on vacation to this island off the coast of Spain; they get there, and the adults are gone. Just very, very creepy kids. They realize that something infected the kids and they all went crazy, killed the adults. So he&#x2019;s got to defend himself, but how do you kill a 3-year-old kid? Like, you can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s your instinct to protect children, but these are amazing killer kids. There&#x2019;s a scene where they&#x2019;re trapped in a jail cell, and they look up, and there&#x2019;s a 3-year-old, and he&#x2019;s got a gun and starts pointing it at the couple in the jail cell. And the kid&#x2019;s just smiling.

Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRNTepXZd8o"><em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em></a> (1974). I really, literally, thought that was made by a Manson Family-like group in Texas somewhere. As a filmmaker, you have to cross those lines, as I did in my first couple of films to the point where people spurned my company. The audience has to feel like the director is dangerous: He crossed lines he shouldn&#x2019;t cross, and he might put anything up on the screen. <strong>Wes Craven, Filmmaker, <em>Scream</em> series, <em>A Nightmare On Elm Street</em>, <em>The Last House On The Left</em></strong></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.18"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55931af07dbd34d650ec8753/master/w_806/ei1p-horror-trivia-40th-anniversary-of-the-texas-chainsaw-massacre.gif" alt="ei1p-horror-trivia-40th-anniversary-of-the-texas-chainsaw-massacre.gif"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=ei1p-horror-trivia-40th-anniversary-of-the-texas-chainsaw-massacre.gif"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=ei1p-horror-trivia-40th-anniversary-of-the-texas-chainsaw-massacre.gif" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931af07dbd34d650ec8753%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fei1p-horror-trivia-40th-anniversary-of-the-texas-chainsaw-massacre.gif&amp;description=ei1p-horror-trivia-40th-anniversary-of-the-texas-chainsaw-massacre.gif"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931af07dbd34d650ec8753%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fei1p-horror-trivia-40th-anniversary-of-the-texas-chainsaw-massacre.gif&amp;description=ei1p-horror-trivia-40th-anniversary-of-the-texas-chainsaw-massacre.gif" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.19"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1a"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55931aee7dbd34d650ec872e/master/w_806/entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-muholland_drive.jpg" alt="entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-muholland_drive.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-muholland_drive.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-muholland_drive.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aee7dbd34d650ec872e%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-muholland_drive.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-muholland_drive.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aee7dbd34d650ec872e%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-muholland_drive.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-muholland_drive.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1b">David Lynch taps into something unexplainable. Like the scene in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzWDzGxqqa0"><em><strong>Mulholland Dr.</strong></em></a> where two people meet up in a diner in the middle of the day and one of the guys describes his dreams to the other guy. It&#x2019;s one of the scariest scenes ever committed to film, but it shouldn&#x2019;t be. Nothing about that scene should be scary at all. Lynch is able to tap into something that&#x2019;s scary for human beings: fear of the unknown. A big clich about Lynch is that his films are dreamlike, but it&#x2019;s true. Dreams follow weird logic. Lynch&#x2019;s films are like that: feels like a nightmare. <strong>Leigh Whannell, Writer, <em>Saw</em> and <em>Insidious</em> series</strong></p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/yusKlHgtvIE" height="315" width="560"></iframe></div></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55931aeed804e2df1837bf78/master/w_806/entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-siamese_twins.jpg" alt="entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-siamese_twins.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-siamese_twins.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-siamese_twins.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aeed804e2df1837bf78%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-siamese_twins.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-siamese_twins.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aeed804e2df1837bf78%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-siamese_twins.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-siamese_twins.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Everett Collection</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1f">In 1974, with the bad half of a marijuana cigarette in me, I experienced this film on Hollywood Boulevard that just rocks my world: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YlyiTbMMOE"><strong><em>Sisters</em></strong></a> (1973) plays on the fear of Siamese twins. The Brian De Palma film stars Margot Kidder, in French-Canadian lushness. And there&#x2019;s a phenomenal mad doctor played by William Finley. He&#x2019;s like a giant sweating grasshopper. It&#x2019;s just an incredible performance; he literally cuts the Siamese twins in half so that he can fuck one of them. That&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;s after. I would love to see it correctly projected, although I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s a Blu-ray out. It would look great on a fifty-inch flat-screen with curvature in the goddamn man cave.<strong> Robert Englund, Actor (Freddy Krueger)</strong></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55931aef7dbd34d650ec8747/master/w_806/entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-1-5-not-scariest-horror-movie-tropes%20copy.jpg" alt="entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-1-5-not-scariest-horror-movie-tropes%20copy.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-1-5-not-scariest-horror-movie-tropes%2520copy.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-1-5-not-scariest-horror-movie-tropes%2520copy.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aef7dbd34d650ec8747%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-1-5-not-scariest-horror-movie-tropes%2520copy.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-1-5-not-scariest-horror-movie-tropes%2520copy.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aef7dbd34d650ec8747%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-1-5-not-scariest-horror-movie-tropes%2520copy.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-1-5-not-scariest-horror-movie-tropes%2520copy.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1i"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1j"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55931aefd804e2df1837bf7d/master/w_806/entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-outspace.jpg" alt="entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-outspace.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-outspace.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-outspace.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aefd804e2df1837bf7d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-outspace.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-outspace.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aefd804e2df1837bf7d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-outspace.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-outspace.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Universal/The Kobal Collection</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1k">I jumped up and ran screaming to the back of the theater but eventually sat back down, because I was fascinated. Horrified, but fascinated. I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85xpN_Ohwqs"><strong><em>It Came from Outer Space</em></strong></a> (1953) in 3-D, which was not a good thing for a young kid. A meteor (we find out later it&#x2019;s a spaceship) streaks across the desert night sky. Cut to an angle where the burning ball of fire comes hurtling straight into the camera and explodes. I didn&#x2019;t understand anything. <em>Why is this meteor blowing up in my face?</em> Horror works best when you&#x2019;re young, when we have these imaginations that are still very active. As you get older, your knowledge of your own limits, and of death, sometimes takes away from horror&#x2019;s appeal. <strong>John Carpenter, Creator, <em>Halloween</em></strong></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1l"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1m"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55931aefd804e2df1837bf83/master/w_806/entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-frankenstein.jpg" alt="entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-frankenstein.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-frankenstein.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;t=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-frankenstein.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aefd804e2df1837bf83%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-frankenstein.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-frankenstein.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fscariest-horror-movies-ever&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55931aefd804e2df1837bf83%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2014-11-horror-package-frankenstein.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2014-11-horror-package-frankenstein.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Universal/The Kobal Collection</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1n">The reason I made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8GRQHsAVjI">Young Frankenstein</a> was because when I was 5 or 6 years old, I was scared out of my wits by James Whale&#x2019;s <em><strong>Frankenstein</strong></em>. I could not get images of Boris Karloff&#x2019;s face out of my head. I would see him in every alley and around every dark corner. One very hot night in July, I asked my mother to close my bedroom window. In Brooklyn in 1931, there was no such thing as air-conditioning. I explained that Frankenstein (that is what we mistakenly called The Monster) was out to get me! And since my bedroom window was on the fire escape, it would be easy for him to climb up and crush me like a bug. My mother patiently explained that he would have to crawl out of his burning cellar in Transylvania and find the money to buy a railway ticket to get a train to take him to Hamburg. He would then have to raise the money to buy a boat ticket to get from Hamburg to New York City. When he landed in New York, he would have to find the right subway train to take him to Brooklyn. He would have to ask a lot of people to find out where I lived, and she was sure nobody would tell him. I said, &quot;Okay, leave the window open!&quot; And that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m alive today. <strong>Mel Brooks</strong></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".963isrjyf4.1.1.0.0.4.1o"><figure

The thing I remember the most is a scene where they kill a huge river turtle. No way is that entertaining in any way. You can see it&#x2019;s real. They rip the shell off, you know, they kill it all on camera, and it&#x2019;s just horrible. And then they move right from that to other people doing things that are obviously fake, but just as nasty and brutally violent. It&#x2019;s the closest thing you&#x2019;re going to get to watching a snuff film, other than actually watching a snuff film if they actually exist.
