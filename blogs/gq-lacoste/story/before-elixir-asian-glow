  	    "articleBody": "Koreatown, New York. The scene at Third Floor Cafe is decadent and plush, a little slice of Vegas nightlife tucked above the busy foot traffic of 32nd Street. The lights in here are dim, save for some gaudy red, purple, and blue laser lights and the lusty red illuminating the back of the lounge where the couches are. My friend leads me to a table surrounded by a few of his friends and out-of-town guests just as their bottle service arrives: Grey Goose and cranberry juice for a mixer. I introduce myself and nervously, sheepishly, open up my big purse and pull out a small eight-ounce clear bottle of a pink drink. Not gonna lie: I feel like a drug dealer. \u000A\u000A\u0022What\u0027s that?\u0022 they ask. \u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s supposed to prevent Asian Glow.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a collective round of suspicious laughs as several people reach for the bottle. \u0022Really?! How?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhat is Asian glow? In the simplest terms, it\u0027s when you consume alcohol and your skin turns red. It\u0027s most present in those of East Asian descent. Though many people mistake the reaction as an allergy to alcohol, the flush is actually due to a variation or deficiency in the gene that helps break down alcohol. \u0022If you\u0027re Asian, you know this problem. It\u0027s plagued you your entire life,\u0022 says Jen Du, creator and CEO of Before Elixir, the new drink that claims to prevent Asian glow. \u0022Sometimes I get a response of, ‘Oh, my gosh, are you kidding me? I\u0027ve been needing something like this my entire life.\u0027 Their eyes bug out and their jaws literally drop when I tell them what the drink does.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe reasons for the \u0022glow\u0022 are twofold, according to the doctors I spoke with. When you drink, an enzyme called ADH converts alcohol into acetaldehyde, a toxin, which another enzyme called ALDH2 then metabolizes into a less harmful substance called acetate. People who flush have a variant in their enzymes that causes them to metabolize and process alcohol up to 100 times faster than the average human. This means that the 50 percent of East Asians who possess this enzyme often skip right past the buzzy, fun effects of alcohol and basically start feeling shitty right away: flushing, racing heartbeat, headaches—the works. Then there\u0027s a smaller portion of those who suffer from the reaction (5 to 7 percent) who actually lack that enzyme entirely and end up having a much more severe reaction. \u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not bad. It tastes like Vitamin Water.Twitter\u000A\u000ADu says she falls in the latter category. \u0022I have both—I have the variant of the first enzyme, and I lack the second enzyme. So when I drink, I turn not only red, but I get really sick,\u0022 she says. \u0022I get headaches, my heart is pounding, my head is pounding, and I\u0027m bedridden for six hours when I drink. Even after half a shot, I\u0027ll feel terrible.\u0022\u000A\u000ABefore Elixir was born out of a startup workshop competition Du entered and won in 2013, she was attending Rutgers Business School in New Jersey. Challenged with finding an idea that she knew was a problem, Du thought of her own experiences with Asian glow. After a few ill-fated attempts at drinking during undergrad, a friend offered her a B-complex vitamin. It helped. She didn\u0027t get sick, though she did turn slightly red. So it dawned on her: Maybe some kind of vitamin cocktail is the ticket to winning this whole thing and launching her own business. \u000A\u000ASo she set out looking for a more natural alternative to the histamine blockers, like Pepcid AC, that many Asian people illicitly use to combat redness. Du teamed up with Dr. David Sprague, department chair of biotechnology at Temple College, who became her advisor and angel investor. Du says she also worked with beverage formulators to research and test the ingredients that make up Before Elixir, which is a combo of B-complex vitamins, amino acids, antioxidants like mangosteen and lipoic acid, milk thistle, and pomegranate and raspberry extracts to help with the flavor profile. She recommends finishing a whole 8-ounce bottle before drinking. \u000A\u000A\u0022B vitamins boost your immunity, so if you\u0027re metabolizing alcohol too quickly, you want something to slow that down,\u0022 Du claims. \u0022Pepcid AC works because [it\u0027s a histamine blocker], and it slows down your digestion.\u0022 And while histamine blockers and antacids have been a favorite among people who flush, studies have shown that mixing the medicine with alcohol can significantly increase blood alcohol levels. \u0022I\u0027m not a doctor or a scientist,\u0022 Du says, a fact I kept mulling over the course of reporting this story. \u0022But I don\u0027t think it\u0027s a good idea to take a medicine to solve a problem it\u0027s not intended to solve,\u0022 . \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe K-Town party group is interested but skeptical. \u0022I\u0027m not gonna end up in a roadside ditch, am I?\u0022 says one friend. A couple of people stare at the label; a few go to the drink\u0027s Indiegogo page before deciding to try it out. \u000A\u000AAfter a few sips I ask the group how it tastes. \u0022It\u0027s not bad,\u0022 says my friend Jen, 28. \u0022It tastes like Vitamin Water.\u0022  (Vitamin Water turns out to be a common refrain—on a separate occasion, another friend described it as having \u0022a hint of a sulfur-y aftertaste., sorta like rotten eggs, like when you go to Yellowstone or something.\u0022) \u0022It\u0027s not, like, disgusting,\u0022 says another tester, Phil. \u0022But it\u0027s not something I would drink voluntarily.\u0022 (For what it\u0027s worth, Du has since revamped the formulation to improve the taste slightly. The first batch of samples I received were Version 1.0.) \u000A\u000AAs we wait for the 30 minutes to pass and watch finance bros chat up groups of girls by the bar, I ask my friend Roger, 28, whether he thinks turning red is a source of concern when dating. \u0022I think it depends,\u0022 he says. \u0022Like if the girl herself gets Asian glow, then I don\u0027t think she\u0027ll mind if [a guy] gets Asian glow. You\u0027ll have these two people who are a couple Asian glow together and that\u0027s pretty adorable.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut he\u0027s buzzed, and a few minutes later he crashes—hard. He belches a groan, and begins to redden. \u0022I just want to take a nap now.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000ABut it can be a social faux pas for some guys, Roger conceded. \u0022It\u0027s kind of like in Hitch when he gets all swollen and has to get Benadryl. I know guys that get really red, and on dates it\u0027s kind of embarrassing because they\u0027re supposed to be really macho but instead they get embarrassingly red, like chili pepper red.\u0022\u000A\u000AI check in with my testers after they\u0027ve had a drink or two. My friend Jen says she\u0027s feeling the alcohol more than she thought she would, but that she doesn\u0027t seem to be as flush as she normally is. Another friend has his doubts. \u0022The thing is, I don\u0027t want to have to finish a whole bottle drink and wait a half an hour before I actually consume any alcohol,\u0022 Phil says. \u0022I think maybe [they should] make it a pill, that\u0027s easier to consume and you don\u0027t have to taste it.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe night\u0027s experiment wasn\u0027t quite conclusive, so I decide to test the elixir\u0027s new formula on several other friends over the course of the next month. Version 2.0 showed an improvement in taste—the sulfuric aftertaste was replaced with a spicy citrus flavor, which was more pleasant. After an informal afternoon test of two shots of vodka, David, 30, finds his face is less flush than normal. It seems like the drink has worked cosmetically, though he still feels warm and feels his heart beating funny.\u000A\u000AFor the more serious glowers (those who probably lack the second enzyme), the results are more complicated. \u0022I feel like I should be getting red right around now,\u0022 Howard, 33, says after a shot, which would normally be enough to send him straight to bed. Surprisingly, there\u0027s no flush in sight yet. But he\u0027s buzzed, and a few minutes later he crashes—hard. He belches a groan, and begins to redden. \u0022I just want to take a nap now.\u0022\u000A\u000ATuwie, 28, also finds that the drink has helped prevent her usual glow, though a trip to the restaurant bathroom reveals that her stomach and legs are covered in red hives like usual. \u0022My face is the important part, though,\u0022 she says with a smile.\u000A\u000AMy friend Liz, 28, is the most eager tester, texting me excitedly from across the country in San Francisco upon hearing about the experiment. A Pepcid AC loyalist for years who typically glows \u0022like a watermelon\u0022 after one drink, she was interested in seeing if anything could match her preventative drug of choice. Her first test was to see if it could withstand the copious drinking of the Work Business Trip Dinner. The one bottle was able to keep redness at bay for an hour-and-a-half before things took a turn. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHer second test was during the day, this time with beers instead of liquor, which yielded better results. Her conclusion: It worked pretty well, but not as well as Pepcid. \u0022Before I even started drinking alcohol, I felt my chest tighten and heart rate increase,\u0022 she Gchats me, noting the sour taste. \u0022I didn\u0027t like how indiscreet it was. I\u0027d be carrying the drink and people would ask about it.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo: Does it work? To find out, I asked a few scientists to weigh in. \u0022I was hoping one of the ingredients would be tryptophan,\u0022 Dr. Hans Fisher, a nutritional biochemist and Professor Emeritus of Rutgers University, tells me on the phone after I read him the ingredients. \u0022That is one amino acid that could really have an effect.\u0022 The vitamins, Fisher explains, would help metabolize alcohol, but couldn\u0027t specifically target it to the point where it would have a huge effect on flush. \u000A\u000AAccording to Dr. Akira Yokoyama of the Kurihama Alcohol Center in Japan, the ingredients in the elixir could help slow down the metabolization of the alcohol, and thus the production of the harmful acetaldehyde. Cysteine—one of the amino acids in the drink—\u0022is known to be a scavenger of acetaldehyde,\u0022 Yokoyama wrote to me in an email. However, he noted that he didn\u0027t think it substantially affects the acetaldehyde concentrations—meaning it probably won\u0027t do anything if you have heart palpitations—but it could have a little impact in the initial flush trigger.\u000A\u000AOf course, some of it could simply be the placebo effect. \u0022If people believe in it, they\u0027ll get some positive results,\u0022 Dr. Fisher says. \u0022[There might not be] anything in it that\u0027s of any value, but if you believe in it, often it helps at least for a while. This placebo effect is extremely effective for many people because they\u0027re so anxious to find something that will work, that it really does help.\u0022\u000A\u000AIf people believe in it, they\u0027ll get some positive results. [There might not be] anything in it that\u0027s of any value, but if you believe in it, often it helps at least for a while.Twitter\u000A\u000AAnother night in K-Town. It\u0027s  2 a.m. and I\u0027m at a popular after-hours spot for drinks and fried chicken. As I\u0027m waiting for friends, I pull the small pink bottle out from my purse and lean over to the two model-esque male bartenders across from me. They\u0027re gorgeous and they know it; their arms look like they\u0027re chiseled out of marble. As I\u0027m explaining to one of them what it does, I notice a young Asian guy next to me alone at the bar. \u000A\u000AHe taps me on the arm. \u0022Wait, does that actually work?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, hopefully we\u0027re gonna find out,\u0022 I say, a little surprised by the eavesdropping. I turn back to my conversation. Two minutes later, another tap. \u0022So, it actually works, though? Because I would definitely want to try it out. Where can I get it?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAylin Zafar is a writer based in New York. She has also written for BuzzFeed, TIME, and The Atlantic.",

The scene at Third Floor Cafe is decadent and plush, a little slice of Vegas nightlife tucked above the busy foot traffic of 32nd Street. The lights in here are dim, save for some gaudy red, purple, and blue laser lights and the lusty red illuminating the back of the lounge where the couches are. My friend leads me to a table surrounded by a few of his friends and out-of-town guests just as their bottle service arrives: Grey Goose and cranberry juice for a mixer. I introduce myself and nervously, sheepishly, open up my big purse and pull out a small eight-ounce clear bottle of a pink drink. Not gonna lie: I feel like a drug dealer. </p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.1">&#x201C;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201D; they ask. </p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s supposed to prevent Asian Glow.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.3">There&#x2019;s a collective round of suspicious laughs as several people reach for the bottle. &#x201C;Really?! How?&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.5"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.6">What is Asian glow? In the simplest terms, it&#x2019;s when you consume alcohol and your skin turns red. It&#x2019;s most present in those of East Asian descent. Though many people mistake the reaction as an allergy to alcohol, the flush is actually due to a variation or deficiency in the gene that helps break down alcohol. &#x201C;If you&#x2019;re Asian, you know this problem. It&#x2019;s plagued you your entire life,&#x201D; says Jen Du, creator and CEO of <a href="http://www.beforeelixir.com/">Before Elixir</a>, the new drink that claims to prevent Asian glow. &#x201C;Sometimes I get a response of, &#x2018;Oh, my gosh, are you kidding me? I&#x2019;ve been needing something like this my entire life.&#x2019; Their eyes bug out and their jaws literally drop when I tell them what the drink does.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.7">The reasons for the &#x201C;glow&#x201D; are twofold, according to the doctors I spoke with. When you drink, an enzyme called ADH converts alcohol into acetaldehyde, a toxin, which another enzyme called ALDH2 then metabolizes into a less harmful substance called acetate. People who flush have a variant in their enzymes that causes them to metabolize and process alcohol up to 100 times faster than the average human. This means that the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Db=gene&amp;Cmd=ShowDetailView&amp;TermToSearch=217">50 percent of East Asians who possess this enzyme</a> often skip right past the buzzy, fun effects of alcohol and basically start feeling shitty right away: flushing, racing heartbeat, headaches&#x2014;the works. Then there&apos;s a smaller portion of those who suffer from the reaction (5 to 7 percent) who actually lack that enzyme <em>entirely</em> and end up having a much more severe reaction. </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.8"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>It&#x2019;s not bad. It tastes like Vitamin Water.</p></blockquote></span><div class="pullquote-share twitter"><a class="pullquote-share-icon" href="https://twitter.com/share?via=GQ&amp;text=%22It%E2%80%99s%20not%20bad.%20It%20tastes%20like%20Vitamin%20Water.%22" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.9">Du says she falls in the latter category. &#x201C;I have both&#x2014;I have the variant of the first enzyme, and I lack the second enzyme. So when I drink, I turn not only red, but I get really sick,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;I get headaches, my heart is pounding, my head is pounding, and I&#x2019;m bedridden for six hours when I drink. Even after half a shot, I&#x2019;ll feel terrible.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.a">Before Elixir was born out of a startup workshop competition Du entered and won in 2013, she was attending Rutgers Business School in New Jersey. Challenged with finding an idea that she knew was a problem, Du thought of her own experiences with Asian glow. After a few ill-fated attempts at drinking during undergrad, a friend offered her a B-complex vitamin. It helped. She didn&apos;t get sick, though she did turn slightly red. So it dawned on her: Maybe some kind of vitamin cocktail is the ticket to winning this whole thing and launching her own business. </p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.b">So she set out looking for a more natural alternative to the histamine blockers, like Pepcid AC, that many Asian people illicitly use to combat redness. Du teamed up with Dr. David Sprague, department chair of biotechnology at Temple College, who became her advisor and angel investor. Du says she also worked with beverage formulators to research and test the ingredients that make up Before Elixir, which is a combo of B-complex vitamins, amino acids, antioxidants like mangosteen and lipoic acid, milk thistle, and pomegranate and raspberry extracts to help with the flavor profile. She recommends finishing a whole 8-ounce bottle before drinking. </p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.c">&#x201C;B vitamins boost your immunity, so if you&#x2019;re metabolizing alcohol too quickly, you want something to slow that down,&#x201D; Du claims. &#x201C;Pepcid AC works because [it&#x2019;s a histamine blocker], and it slows down your digestion.&#x201D; And while histamine blockers and antacids have been a favorite among people who flush, studies have shown that mixing the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18080701">medicine with alcohol</a> can significantly <a href="http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/news/20000215/zantac-alcohol-dont-mix">increase</a> blood alcohol levels. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not a doctor or a scientist,&quot; Du says, a fact I kept mulling over the course of reporting this story. &#x201C;But I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a good idea to take a medicine to solve a problem it&#x2019;s not intended to solve,&#x201D; . </p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.d"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.e">The K-Town party group is interested but skeptical. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not gonna end up in a roadside ditch, am I?&#x201D; says one friend. A couple of people stare at the label; a few go to the drink&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/before-elixir">Indiegogo page</a> before deciding to try it out. </p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.f">After a few sips I ask the group how it tastes. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not bad,&#x201D; says my friend Jen, 28. &#x201C;It tastes like Vitamin Water.&#x201D;  (Vitamin Water turns out to be a common refrain&#x2014;on a separate occasion, another friend described it as having &#x201C;a hint of a sulfur-y aftertaste., sorta like rotten eggs, like when you go to Yellowstone or something.&#x201D;) &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not, like, disgusting,&#x201D; says another tester, Phil. &#x201C;But it&#x2019;s not something I would drink voluntarily.&#x201D; (For what it&#x2019;s worth, Du has since revamped the formulation to improve the taste slightly. The first batch of samples I received were Version 1.0.) </p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.g">As we wait for the 30 minutes to pass and watch finance bros chat up groups of girls by the bar, I ask my friend Roger, 28, whether he thinks turning red is a source of concern when dating. &#x201C;I think it depends,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Like if the girl herself gets Asian glow, then I don&#x2019;t think she&apos;ll mind if [a guy] gets Asian glow. You&#x2019;ll have these two people who are a couple Asian glow together and that&#x2019;s pretty adorable.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.h"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>But he&#x2019;s buzzed, and a few minutes later he crashes&#x2014;hard.

I know guys that get really red, and on dates it&#x2019;s kind of embarrassing because they&#x2019;re supposed to be really macho but instead they get embarrassingly red, like chili pepper red.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.j">I check in with my testers after they&#x2019;ve had a drink or two. My friend Jen says she&apos;s feeling the alcohol more than she thought she would, but that she doesn&apos;t seem to be as flush as she normally is. Another friend has his doubts. &#x201C;The thing is, I don&#x2019;t want to have to finish a whole bottle drink and wait a half an hour before I actually consume any alcohol,&#x201D; Phil says. &#x201C;I think maybe [they should] make it a pill, that&apos;s easier to consume and you don&#x2019;t have to taste it.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.k"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.l">The night&#x2019;s experiment wasn&apos;t quite conclusive, so I decide to test the elixir&#x2019;s new formula on several other friends over the course of the next month. Version 2.0 showed an improvement in taste&#x2014;the sulfuric aftertaste was replaced with a spicy citrus flavor, which was more pleasant. After an informal afternoon test of two shots of vodka, David, 30, finds his face is less flush than normal. It seems like the drink has worked cosmetically, though he still feels warm and feels his heart beating funny.</p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.m">For the more serious glowers (those who probably lack the second enzyme), the results are more complicated. &#x201C;I feel like I should be getting red right around now,&#x201D; Howard, 33, says after a shot, which would normally be enough to send him straight to bed. Surprisingly, there&#x2019;s no flush in sight yet. But he&#x2019;s buzzed, and a few minutes later he crashes&#x2014;hard. He belches a groan, and begins to redden. &#x201C;I just want to take a nap now.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.n">Tuwie, 28, also finds that the drink has helped prevent her usual glow, though a trip to the restaurant bathroom reveals that her stomach and legs are covered in red hives like usual. &#x201C;My face is the important part, though,&#x201D; she says with a smile.</p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.o">My friend Liz, 28, is the most eager tester, texting me excitedly from across the country in San Francisco upon hearing about the experiment. A Pepcid AC loyalist for years who typically glows &#x201C;like a watermelon&#x201D; after one drink, she was interested in seeing if anything could match her preventative drug of choice. Her first test was to see if it could withstand the copious drinking of the Work Business Trip Dinner. The one bottle was able to keep redness at bay for an hour-and-a-half before things took a turn. </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.p"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55e0bdeef83274863bb015a4/master/w_600/asian-glow-screenshot.png" alt="asian-glow-screenshot.png"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbefore-elixir-asian-glow&amp;t=asian-glow-screenshot.png"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbefore-elixir-asian-glow&amp;t=asian-glow-screenshot.png" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbefore-elixir-asian-glow&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55e0bdeef83274863bb015a4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fasian-glow-screenshot.png&amp;description=asian-glow-screenshot.png"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbefore-elixir-asian-glow&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55e0bdeef83274863bb015a4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fasian-glow-screenshot.png&amp;description=asian-glow-screenshot.png" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.q">Her second test was during the day, this time with beers instead of liquor, which yielded better results. Her conclusion: It worked pretty well, but not as well as Pepcid. &#x201C;Before I even started drinking alcohol, I felt my chest tighten and heart rate increase,&#x201D; she Gchats me, noting the sour taste. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t like how indiscreet it was. I&#x2019;d be carrying the drink and people would ask about it.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.r">So: Does it work? To find out, I asked a few scientists to weigh in. &#x201C;I was hoping one of the ingredients would be tryptophan,&#x201D; Dr. Hans Fisher, a nutritional biochemist and Professor Emeritus of Rutgers University, tells me on the phone after I read him the ingredients. &#x201C;That is one amino acid that could really have an effect.&#x201D; The vitamins, Fisher explains, would help metabolize alcohol, but couldn&#x2019;t specifically target it to the point where it would have a huge effect on flush. </p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.s">According to Dr. Akira Yokoyama of the Kurihama Alcohol Center in Japan, the ingredients in the elixir <em>could</em> help slow down the metabolization of the alcohol, and thus the production of the harmful acetaldehyde. Cysteine&#x2014;one of the amino acids in the drink&#x2014;&#x201C;is known to be a scavenger of acetaldehyde,&#x201D; Yokoyama wrote to me in an email. However, he noted that he didn&#x2019;t think it substantially affects the acetaldehyde concentrations&#x2014;meaning it <em>probably</em> won&apos;t do anything if you have heart palpitations&#x2014;but it could have a little impact in the initial flush trigger.</p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.t">Of course, some of it could simply be the placebo effect. &#x201C;If people believe in it, they&#x2019;ll get some positive results,&#x201D; Dr. Fisher says. &#x201C;[There might not be] anything in it that&#x2019;s of any value, but if you believe in it, often it helps at least for a while. This placebo effect is extremely effective for many people because they&#x2019;re so anxious to find something that will work, that it really does help.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.u"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>If people believe in it, they&#x2019;ll get some positive results.

As I&apos;m explaining to one of them what it does, I notice a young Asian guy next to me alone at the bar. </p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.w">He taps me on the arm. &#x201C;Wait, does that actually work?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.x">&#x201C;Well, hopefully we&#x2019;re gonna find out,&#x201D; I say, a little surprised by the eavesdropping. I turn back to my conversation. Two minutes later, another tap. &#x201C;So, it actually works, though? Because I would definitely want to try it out. Where can I get it?&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.y"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1ph2eza9pmo.1.1.0.0.4.z"><em><a href="http://twitter.com/azafar">Aylin Zafar</a> is a writer based in New York.
