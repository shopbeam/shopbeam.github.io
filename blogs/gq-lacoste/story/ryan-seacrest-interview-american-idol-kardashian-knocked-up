  	    "articleBody": "One of the greatest instances of a celebrity breaking the fourth wall with the American public came during the 2007 Judd Apatow movie Knocked Up. In a scene which took place at E! News, Ryan Seacrest, playing himself, gets visibly upset when he is told than Jessica Simpson was running late for her interview. (This was 2007, after all.) \u0022I got four jobs...hell, I\u0027m more famous than half the people we interview anyway....And all these stars just fuck it up, that\u0027s what they do. They fuck my day up!\u0022 You can watch the clip for yourself, but beneath the rant is greater truth: Ryan Seacrest is the busiest man in Hollywood. The question is, how does one man manage to host radio shows, interview stars on the red carpet every awards season, design a collection of suits and formalwear for men, and run the production company that was responsible for birthing the Kardashians, all the while avoiding any real life meltdowns? We talked to Ryan himself to find out. \u000A\u000AHow many jobs do you actually have right now?I actually don\u0027t know the answer. I\u0027ve got three radio shows, American Idol, red carpets for E!, the production company, hosting New Year\u0027s Eve, the clothing line, the Ryan Seacrest Foundation, so nine...close to ten. \u000A\u000AJust day-to-day, how do you manage all of those different projects?I work pretty fast and efficiently. Consolidation is something I\u0027ve learned. I\u0027ve got a lot of things in the same place. For instance, I\u0027ve got the radio show, but then I can walk across the hall to the TV studio. Another thing that allows me to stay on top of things is that I\u0027ve got a great team. I try to find an expert in each of the places I\u0027m working, and I keep updated through them. It\u0027s a puzzle each day, and at the end of the day I get an email brief of everything that happened in every division. \u000A\u000AWhat time do you wake up? Do you work out, and when?I wake up at about five or five-fifteen. I was on the radio at about six. So usually I\u0027ll get up and get ready quickly, have a tea or coffee before I walk out the door. I get to the studio about fifteen minutes before we get on the air. As for working out, there were times in my life when I wasn\u0027t getting it done, and it\u0027s because I wasn\u0027t making it a priority on my schedule. So now, I treat all of my workouts as if they are an executive meeting. Once they\u0027re in the schedule, they\u0027re locked in. But the time can float. It can happen at 10 a.m., it can happen at 5 p.m. \u000A\u000AI\u0027m completely impatient. It\u0027s one of the reasons I manage to get stuff done all the time.Twitter\u000A\u000AAre you someone who relies on coffee and caffeine to get through the day?I don\u0027t drink it every day. I love it, but I don\u0027t drink it every day, just because I think that I shouldn\u0027t. But I am one of those people that goes to bed excited to have coffee in the morning. I just don\u0027t need it every day. I\u0027m usually just motivated once the light goes on, because a lot of what I do is live. So I get a rush out of that. \u000A\u000ADo you keep a clean inbox, or do you have a lot of unread emails?I\u0027m one of those people that if I get an email, I immediately reply. I\u0027ll usually see an email and respond as quickly as possible. I see them all, really. Right now in my inbox there\u0027s a reminder to call you, and then an update to call my scripted division boss. My inbox is pretty active, but I try and see them all within 30 minutes to an hour of receiving them. \u000A\u000AWhat would you consider to be your big break?For me, one of the most exciting moments was being able to be on the radio as a kid, and get that experience at 16-years-old in Atlanta. You know, just opening up that microphone and realizing there\u0027s some power and exposure in that platform. I found that to be incredibly fascinating. But the actual \u0022break\u0022 I think would have to be American Idol. When it started, we realized it was something significantly special and unique. What it did for me individually, was motivate me to do more. I saw it as an opportunity to expand my businesses because I now had access to get the meeting that I didn\u0027t have before the success of that show. \u000A\u000ASo, what\u0027s the secret? How do you stay so motivated to keep on top of all these projects?I\u0027m completely impatient. It\u0027s one of the reasons I manage to get stuff done all the time. I like things to get done quickly. Also, I haven\u0027t had a lunch meeting in 10 years. I never stop for lunch or waste time traveling to a lunch meeting. \u000A\u000ADo you eat lunch?I do. But it\u0027s usually sitting in front of me in a plastic container or in the form of some sort of shake if I\u0027ve decided I look bloated that week. I eat at my desk, I eat in my car, I eat standing, but never do I get in my car, drive somewhere, have an hour lunch and drive back. \u000A\u000AYou went to the University of Georgia, but dropped out. What was the moment you realized college wasn\u0027t for you?I had some opportunities to move out to California, and I thought that if I stayed in school and were to wait, I wouldn\u0027t be able to do it. I wasn\u0027t sure that I could make it, but I remember telling my parents, you know, \u0022I\u0027m at school, I\u0027m distracted because I\u0027m thinking about what I want to do, and I know what I want to do. I don\u0027t need to figure it out. I think I\u0027m okay at it, so I\u0027d like to give it a shot. But if I\u0027m not supporting myself within one year, I\u0027ll come back to school.\u0022 But in my mind I was hell bent on making sure I did everything I could possibly do to not have to come back. \u000A\u000AThis season of American Idol will be the last. Once it\u0027s over, are you planning on filling that time with something?I think so. I don\u0027t know exactly what it will be, but I\u0027ve been talking about a couple different ideas. I don\u0027t see myself being idle after \u0027Idol\u0027, but I know it will be hard to find something like that. It would be nice to find another vehicle in prime time. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestSadao Turner/Ryan Seacrest Enterprises\u000A\u000AIn terms of your accomplishments, where do rank being an executive producer and co-creator of Keeping Up With the Kardashians?Ten years ago, I started this production company with just one employee, and I was watching The Osbournes, and I thought it was great. I just thought it was so funny, and interesting, and cool. This family is not quite normal, but it\u0027s fun to watch. So I said to the guy who worked for me, \u0022Let\u0027s go find another show in this world.\u0022 Kris Jenner simultaneously had been wanting to do a show, and felt her family would be compelling on TV. So she and I met and had a conversation, and I ended up sending a camera crew to a barbecue they had. We shot their barbecue, and looked at the tape, and it was just priceless material. You could see how much love there was in that family. And her and I decided to take the tape to E!. But now, it\u0027s a well-oiled machine. I don\u0027t have to do anything at all. \u000A\u000AAre you proud of what it\u0027s become since that barbecue?I think it\u0027s amazing. It\u0027s a phenomenon. They are literally like a first family in this country, and are tremendously popular around the world. I never would have thought it would become this story after story, year after year business. Kris is an amazing force in that family. She always has something going on with them. But of course, no one could have predicted that Kim was going to get married and then divorced, and then fall in love with Kanye and get married to him, or that even Kendall and Kylie would become superstars too. So it just continues to be a machine of entertainment. \u000A\u000AYour clothing line, Ryan Seacrest Distinction, seemed to get mentioned several times during the Emmys this year. Was that a pre-planned plug, or did Jimmy Kimmel actually not know you were wearing your own brand?I hadn\u0027t spoken to any of those people before hand, so no, Jimmy Kimmel especially. But with Distinction, we pride ourselves on having really great cuts. Before I had my own brand, Christopher Bailey of Burberry was making my suits. I wanted to create clothes that I liked, but I\u0027m not a designer even though I have a good eye for knowing what I like. So I told Christopher that I wanted to make affordable, well-fitted versions of suits and tuxedos and ties and shirts and cufflinks. And he thought it was a great idea and gave me some good advice. \u000A\u000ADo you ever get tired of asking people \u0022What are you wearing?\u0022 season after season?I kind of stopped asking that to everyone over the last year or so. I do sometimes, because women love to show off the designers and give them the publicity, but I remember at the Emmys that there were a handful of people I didn\u0027t ask that question to. Back when I started, I got in trouble for not asking it. But it just depends on the moment, who it is, and I try to read them to see if it\u0027s something they want to talk about. \u000A\u000AWhat kind of mark do you want to leave on the world?I\u0027ve never thought about it. I think about the people that have motivated me. I think it\u0027s so important for young people to have mentors, and to have people to turn to for advice and study. And for me those people were Merv Griffin, and Dick Clark, and Larry King. I think the legacy that I hope to leave is that people think of me as their friend on the radio, their friend on TV, who made it look pretty easy and was a source or a conduit for escapism. I don\u0027t do surgery and it\u0027s not rocket science. And the shows that I\u0027m a part of are versions of escapism. \u000A\u000AYou seem very confident, and not at all embarrassed, to say that.I think my job is to get out of the way. My job is to get things started, get out of the way, and say goodnight. When I\u0027m hosting a show, it\u0027s not about me, it\u0027s about the others that are there, and making them shine, and trying to get the best out of the moments. Whether that means an artist is singing a song on stage or someone is about to perform live on stage in Times Square in front of millions of people around the world. I think the most important trait of hosting is listening and knowing when to get out of the way. \u000A\u000ASpeaking to your cameo in Knocked Up, did that frustration and anger with celebrities come from a real place?Of course! That was my impatience. I\u0027m not as arrogant in real life I hope, but certainly the impatience part was real life. \u000A\u000A",

Idol</em> host/radio talk-show host/E! News red carpet reporter/Kardashian Kreator about how he manages to do it all</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.0">One of the greatest instances of a celebrity breaking the fourth wall with the American public came during the 2007 Judd Apatow movie <em>Knocked Up</em>. In a scene which took place at E! News, Ryan Seacrest, playing himself, gets visibly upset when he is told than Jessica Simpson was running late for her interview. (This was 2007, after all.) &quot;I got four jobs...hell, I&apos;m more famous than half the people we interview anyway....And all these stars just fuck it up, that&apos;s what they do. They fuck my day up!&quot; You can watch the clip for yourself, but beneath the rant is greater truth: Ryan Seacrest is the busiest man in Hollywood. The question is, how does one man manage to host radio shows, interview stars on the red carpet every awards season, design a collection of suits and formalwear for men, and run the production company that was responsible for birthing the Kardashians, all the while avoiding any real life meltdowns? We talked to Ryan himself to find out. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.1"><strong>How many jobs do you actually have right now?</strong><br>I actually don&apos;t know the answer. I&apos;ve got three radio shows, <em>American Idol</em>, red carpets for E!, the production company, hosting New Year&apos;s Eve, the clothing line, the Ryan Seacrest Foundation, so nine...close to ten. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>Just day-to-day, how do you manage all of those different projects?</strong><br>I work pretty fast and efficiently. Consolidation is something I&apos;ve learned. I&apos;ve got a lot of things in the same place. For instance, I&apos;ve got the radio show, but then I can walk across the hall to the TV studio. Another thing that allows me to stay on top of things is that I&apos;ve got a great team. I try to find an expert in each of the places I&apos;m working, and I keep updated through them. It&apos;s a puzzle each day, and at the end of the day I get an email brief of everything that happened in every division. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>What time do you wake up? Do you work out, and when?</strong><br>I wake up at about five or five-fifteen. I was on the radio at about six. So usually I&apos;ll get up and get ready quickly, have a tea or coffee before I walk out the door. I get to the studio about fifteen minutes before we get on the air. As for working out, there were times in my life when I wasn&apos;t getting it done, and it&apos;s because I wasn&apos;t making it a priority on my schedule. So now, I treat all of my workouts as if they are an executive meeting. Once they&apos;re in the schedule, they&apos;re locked in. But the time can float. It can happen at 10 a.m., it can happen at 5 p.m. </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.5"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>I&apos;m completely impatient. It&apos;s one of the reasons I manage to get stuff done all the time.</p></blockquote></span><div class="pullquote-share twitter"><a class="pullquote-share-icon" href="https://twitter.com/share?via=GQ&amp;text=%22I%26%2339%3Bm%20completely%20impatient.%20It%26%2339%3Bs%20one%20of%20the%20reasons%20I%20manage%20to%20get%20stuff%20done%20all%20the%20time.%22" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Are you someone who relies on coffee and caffeine to get through the day?</strong><br>I don&apos;t drink it every day. I love it, but I don&apos;t drink it every day, just because I think that I shouldn&apos;t. But I am one of those people that goes to bed excited to have coffee in the morning. I just don&apos;t need it every day. I&apos;m usually just motivated once the light goes on, because a lot of what I do is live. So I get a rush out of that. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Do you keep a clean inbox, or do you have a lot of unread emails?</strong><br>I&apos;m one of those people that if I get an email, I immediately reply. I&apos;ll usually see an email and respond as quickly as possible. I see them all, really. Right now in my inbox there&apos;s a reminder to call you, and then an update to call my scripted division boss. My inbox is pretty active, but I try and see them all within 30 minutes to an hour of receiving them. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>What would you consider to be your big break?</strong><br>For me, one of the most exciting moments was being able to be on the radio as a kid, and get that experience at 16-years-old in Atlanta. You know, just opening up that microphone and realizing there&apos;s some power and exposure in that platform. I found that to be incredibly fascinating. But the actual &quot;break&quot; I think would have to be <em>American Idol</em>. When it started, we realized it was something significantly special and unique. What it did for me individually, was motivate me to do more. I saw it as an opportunity to expand my businesses because I now had access to get the meeting that I didn&apos;t have before the success of that show. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>So, what&apos;s the secret? How do you stay so motivated to keep on top of all these projects?</strong><br>I&apos;m completely impatient. It&apos;s one of the reasons I manage to get stuff done all the time. I like things to get done quickly. Also, I haven&apos;t had a lunch meeting in 10 years. I never stop for lunch or waste time traveling to a lunch meeting. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Do you eat lunch?</strong><br>I do. But it&apos;s usually sitting in front of me in a plastic container or in the form of some sort of shake if I&apos;ve decided I look bloated that week. I eat at my desk, I eat in my car, I eat standing, but never do I get in my car, drive somewhere, have an hour lunch and drive back. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>You went to the University of Georgia, but dropped out. What was the moment you realized college wasn&apos;t for you?</strong><br>I had some opportunities to move out to California, and I thought that if I stayed in school and were to wait, I wouldn&apos;t be able to do it. I wasn&apos;t sure that I could make it, but I remember telling my parents, you know, &quot;I&apos;m at school, I&apos;m distracted because I&apos;m thinking about what I want to do, and I know what I want to do. I don&apos;t need to figure it out. I think I&apos;m okay at it, so I&apos;d like to give it a shot. But if I&apos;m not supporting myself within one year, I&apos;ll come back to school.&quot; But in my mind I was hell bent on making sure I did everything I could possibly do to not have to come back. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>This season of <em>American Idol</em> will be the last. Once it&apos;s over, are you planning on filling that time with something?</strong><br>I think so. I don&apos;t know exactly what it will be, but I&apos;ve been talking about a couple different ideas. I don&apos;t see myself being idle after &apos;Idol&apos;, but I know it will be hard to find something like that. It would be nice to find another vehicle in prime time. </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.d"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/561fcde702a8cebe217a6252/master/w_806/west_kardashian_seacrest_grammys_2015.jpg" alt="west_kardashian_seacrest_grammys_2015.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fryan-seacrest-interview-american-idol-kardashian-knocked-up&amp;t=west_kardashian_seacrest_grammys_2015.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fryan-seacrest-interview-american-idol-kardashian-knocked-up&amp;t=west_kardashian_seacrest_grammys_2015.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fryan-seacrest-interview-american-idol-kardashian-knocked-up&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F561fcde702a8cebe217a6252%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fwest_kardashian_seacrest_grammys_2015.jpg&amp;description=west_kardashian_seacrest_grammys_2015.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fryan-seacrest-interview-american-idol-kardashian-knocked-up&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F561fcde702a8cebe217a6252%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fwest_kardashian_seacrest_grammys_2015.jpg&amp;description=west_kardashian_seacrest_grammys_2015.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Sadao Turner/Ryan Seacrest Enterprises</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>In terms of your accomplishments, where do rank being an executive producer and co-creator of <em>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</em>?</strong><br>Ten years ago, I started this production company with just one employee, and I was watching <em>The Osbournes,</em> and I thought it was great. I just thought it was so funny, and interesting, and cool. This family is not quite normal, but it&apos;s fun to watch. So I said to the guy who worked for me, &quot;Let&apos;s go find another show in this world.&quot; Kris Jenner simultaneously had been wanting to do a show, and felt her family would be compelling on TV. So she and I met and had a conversation, and I ended up sending a camera crew to a barbecue they had. We shot their barbecue, and looked at the tape, and it was just priceless material. You could see how much love there was in that family. And her and I decided to take the tape to E!. But now, it&apos;s a well-oiled machine. I don&apos;t have to do anything at all. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Are you proud of what it&apos;s become since that barbecue?</strong><br>I think it&apos;s amazing. It&apos;s a phenomenon. They are literally like a first family in this country, and are tremendously popular around the world. I never would have thought it would become this story after story, year after year business. Kris is an amazing force in that family. She always has something going on with them. But of course, no one could have predicted that Kim was going to get married and then divorced, and then fall in love with Kanye and get married to him, or that even Kendall and Kylie would become superstars too. So it just continues to be a machine of entertainment. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Your clothing line, Ryan Seacrest Distinction, seemed to get mentioned several times <a href="ryan-seacrest-emmys-tuxedo-distinction">during the Emmys</a> this year. Was that a pre-planned plug, or did Jimmy Kimmel actually not know you were wearing your own brand?</strong><br>I hadn&apos;t spoken to any of those people before hand, so no, Jimmy Kimmel especially. But with Distinction, we pride ourselves on having really great cuts. Before I had my own brand, Christopher Bailey of Burberry was making my suits. I wanted to create clothes that I liked, but I&apos;m not a designer even though I have a good eye for knowing what I like. So I told Christopher that I wanted to make affordable, well-fitted versions of suits and tuxedos and ties and shirts and cufflinks. And he thought it was a great idea and gave me some good advice. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>Do you ever get tired of asking people &quot;What are you wearing?&quot; season after season?</strong><br>I kind of stopped asking that to everyone over the last year or so. I do sometimes, because women love to show off the designers and give them the publicity, but I remember at the Emmys that there were a handful of people I didn&apos;t ask that question to. Back when I started, I got in trouble for not asking it. But it just depends on the moment, who it is, and I try to read them to see if it&apos;s something they want to talk about. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>What kind of mark do you want to leave on the world?</strong><br>I&apos;ve never thought about it. I think about the people that have motivated me. I think it&apos;s so important for young people to have mentors, and to have people to turn to for advice and study. And for me those people were Merv Griffin, and Dick Clark, and Larry King. I think the legacy that I hope to leave is that people think of me as their friend on the radio, their friend on TV, who made it look pretty easy and was a source or a conduit for escapism. I don&apos;t do surgery and it&apos;s not rocket science. And the shows that I&apos;m a part of are versions of escapism. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>You seem very confident, and not at all embarrassed, to say that.</strong><br>I think my job is to get out of the way. My job is to get things started, get out of the way, and say goodnight. When I&apos;m hosting a show, it&apos;s not about me, it&apos;s about the others that are there, and making them shine, and trying to get the best out of the moments. Whether that means an artist is singing a song on stage or someone is about to perform live on stage in Times Square in front of millions of people around the world. I think the most important trait of hosting is listening and knowing when to get out of the way. </p><p data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Speaking to your cameo in <em>Knocked Up</em>, did that frustration and anger with celebrities come from a real place?</strong><br>Of course! That was my impatience. I&apos;m not as arrogant in real life I hope, but certainly the impatience part was real life. </p><div class="embed figure" data-reactid=".ctia41x9mo.1.1.0.0.4.l"><figure
