  	    "articleBody": "My eyes are blurry from too many post-midnight hours in front of my laptop, trolling through scores of Internet-dating profiles of women. I\u0027m carpet bombing them with the same boilerplate message, suggesting, with unsurpassed creativity and seductiveness, that we get together for a drink.\u000A\u000AJust one catch: Most of them are married.\u000A\u000AActually, a second catch: I have a girlfriend.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI\u0027m on AshleyMadison.com, the behemoth of extramarital-dating sites, whose controversial slogan is \u0022Life is short. Have an affair.®\u0022 You\u0027ve probably heard of it. But you probably don\u0027t know anyone on it—or at least anyone who admits to being on it.\u000A\u000ABecause if you go on the site, you\u0027ll find a lot of avatars adorned with a simple drawing of a woman\u0027s face and a confidential finger over pursed pink lips, with the promise of additional \u0022Private Showcase\u0022 photos, viewable only if the member sends you a \u0022key.\u0022 Many profiles are eloquent and demure, asking men to compose thoughtful missives and to refrain from sending erection photos. But a number are either fake, or appear to be from sex workers, or are written like the following: \u0022to have a well built guy with a huge spear shove it in my tight MILF [orifice not anatomically designed for sexual intercourse] in front of my husband all night long!!!!!!!! TO BE TREATED LIKE I WAS THE LAST WOMAN ON EARTH BY A HUNGRY GROUP OF MEN, PREFERABLY ALL [ethnic group whose male members are often hypersexualized in American culture, due in part to a complex legacy of discrimination]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BIG THICK [rhyming masculine body part] NEED APPLY!!!\u0022\u000A\u000AClearly I need to embellish my résumé. My first e-mail blitz, which doesn\u0027t specify that I\u0027m a journalist hoping to interview subjects, nets me a grand total of zero replies. Still got it! I change tack and name-drop GQ and assure recipients that their anonymity will be preserved. Most women continue to ignore me, some flatly respond no, and several are dubious about my identity.\u000A\u000AYet a few replies roll in. One is from Megan. (Identifying details have been obscured or altered slightly to ensure anonymity, and all names are fictitious.) She lists her weight at well over 200 pounds, her limits are \u0022Anything Goes,\u0022 and her tagline is \u0022I\u0027m too much for you.\u0022 And what is she looking for? \u0022Sex.... I\u0027m not here at AM to meet someone for the opera, I assure you.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Just to be clear, is this a sexy date or a formal interview?\u0022 she writes. \u0022Ideally we could combine the two.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat the hell is going on here? What, exactly, is compelling these married women to set up \u0022sexy dates\u0022 in droves, aside from easy Internet access? For years, our collective narrative of the errant housewife has run thusly: Neglected by her aloof or abusive husband and dying a slow death from her suburban prison, she falls into the arms of a dashing, romantic gentleman. In myths, novels, and films, from Helen of Troy to Hester Prynne in The Scarlet Letter to Diane Lane in 2002\u0027s Unfaithful, the affair of the rare philandering female is the centerpiece of the story, and its punishments are draconian (the Trojan War, ostracism and branding with an A, being cast in Must Love Dogs). On the other hand, just try to name every single guy who has cheated on Mad Men—and gotten away with it. Then again, Mad Men takes place fifty years ago.\u000A\u000AIn the real world, with greater professional equality between the genders and third-wave-feminist sexual liberation, are women cheating for the same reason that men have throughout history, as Megan\u0027s profile suggests—that is, to sate their sex drives and gratify their egos?\u000A\u000AIn the spirit of this gender reversal, I invite you to picture me as Carrie Bradshaw, sprawled out on her bed with her PowerBook G3, as she voice-overs, \u0022I couldn\u0027t help but wonder: Are unfaithful women the new adulterous men? Has Casanova turned into...Cassandra?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AMegan\u000A\u000AMegan has picked Coppelia, a Latin American diner at the border of Chelsea and the West Village in Manhattan, and she\u0027s waiting in a booth when I arrive. She recognizes me from my profile photo, and I slide in across from her. She\u0027s around 40, wearing casual, loose-fitting clothes and a pleasant smile. In short, she doesn\u0027t fit the portrait of the promiscuous, inconstant woman cast as the adulteress in Hollywood dramas.\u000A\u000AI thank her for meeting me. She says it\u0027s no big deal. It is, though—if her identity were somehow unmasked, it could torpedo her high-powered career: She\u0027s worked for one of the most prominent political figures in the country and nearly ended up in Obama\u0027s administration.\u000A\u000AOver cold Cusque&amp;#xF1;a beers on a hot July afternoon, Megan drops the professional mien. \u0022I\u0027m a dirty old man trapped in a woman\u0027s body,\u0022 she says. \u0022I lust after younger men the way dirty old men lust after younger girls. I get dirty old men. I\u0027m looking for eye candy. I\u0027m very shallow.\u0022\u000A\u000AShe tells me that she\u0027s been corporeally disloyal in relationships since she started having sex at 16 and has don\u0027t-ask, don\u0027t-tell permission to frolic with other lovers from her \u0022nerd\u0022 husband of nearly two decades, with whom she has several children.\u000A\u000A\u0022He can barely handle me, and he\u0027s super-vanilla,\u0022 Megan says. \u0022But he\u0027s also a fantastic guy and father. We have a really happy and functional house.\u0022\u000A\u000AShe hoped marriage would change her cheating ways, but two years later found herself straying—as much out of a lust for life as for flesh. \u0022I find myself living my life in the third person and deciding whether it\u0027d be a good story.\u0022 She takes a sip of beer. \u0022I want it to be dramatic.\u0022\u000A\u000ASince then, she\u0027s averaged one or two new men per year, with a few women sprinkled in, and in the digital age has supplemented her search with Ashley Madison, Craigslist, and CougarLife. As is customary for women on Ashley Madison, she gets bombarded by suitors, then rejects about 90 percent of those she meets. To her, the main contrast in the libidos of the genders is not their size but their pickiness.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022Women want their affairs to have sexual attraction,\u0022 she opines. \u0022Men just want their affairs to have a vagina.\u0022\u000A\u000AFor some reason, a professional photographer sets up a tripod and camera at the entrance and walks past us several times. Megan seems discomfited. I assure her the photographer is not with me.\u000A\u000AHer friends (granted, a self-selecting cohort) are just as randy as she is, though not all seek out external solutions—to their detriment, she believes. \u0022They\u0027re all unhappy with the amount of sex they\u0027re getting—the ones who are still married,\u0022 she says. \u0022I feel like I\u0027m the healthiest one out there. The ones who\u0027ve started playing around are much happier.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut what about the guilt? \u0022I really consider it a favor to my husband. My marriage would be in shambles if I wasn\u0027t playing outside the marriage.\u0022 Such playing is not without its risks; she\u0027s fallen for men before, she admits, and says heartbreak is part of the game.\u000A\u000AMegan prefers younger men whom she can think of as her \u0022boy toys—my playthings.\u0022 She asks how old I am. I tell her 33, and she points at me and says, \u0022That\u0027s my perfect age.\u0022 Later she clasps her hand over mine for a few seconds when I make a joke. Soon after, she removes my glasses without asking permission. \u0022Your glasses are so clouded, I need to clean them,\u0022 she explains, wiping them on her shirt.\u000A\u000AMegan also has some olfactory qualifications. \u0022I need to smell men,\u0022 she tells me. \u0022They need to smell good to me: healthy, alive, confident. I can smell fear; I want them to smell like they deserve me. I\u0027ve met guys who are theoretically attractive, but they don\u0027t smell right.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a pregnant pause; we both know what\u0027s coming next. \u0022Do you want to smell me?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A\u0022I haven\u0027t really put my nose into your neck, which is where the smell holds,\u0022 she says, and stands to the side of the table. I join her, expecting her to crane just her nostrils into me, but she embraces me in a hug, pulls me tightly into her expansive bosom, and burrows her face into the crook of my neck for a deep whiff.\u000A\u000A\u0022You smell good,\u0022 she says with the cool detachment of a pheromone connoisseur, eyeing me in what seems to be a new light.\u000A\u000AAs our interview winds down, she asks what my romantic situation is. I tell her I have a girlfriend. \u0022Are you in an open relationship?\u0022 she asks. No, I answer. \u0022Too bad,\u0022 she says softly.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAshley\u000A\u000A\u0022The women\u0027s movement into the workplace was the first massive jump into unfaithfulness,\u0022 says Noel Biderman, CEO of Ashley Madison. \u0022The more financial independence women have, the more it correlates to how unfaithful they\u0027ll be.\u0022 When Biderman launched the site in 2001, he predicted \u0022that the Internet would be the second massive jump and usher in an era where women would behave like men. Ten years later, having built a female brand, I think I was right.\u0022\u000A\u000AAshley Madison now says it has approximately 6 million active members in thirty countries (about 4 million in the United States). Revenues in 2012 were $100 million—more than decent, but still far behind the titans of online dating like Match.com and eHarmony. While the overall membership skews 70 percent male, Biderman claims gender parity among people in their thirties (which translates to lots of lecherous 65-year-old men hitting on 30-year-old women).\u000A\u000ABiderman says he is happily married and regards his venture as a release valve for those in sexually unfulfilling, but otherwise effective, unions. In a joint interview with his wife on Australian TV\u0027s A Current Affair (ha!), he defended his company by saying, \u0022I would rather see people pursue [an affair] and stay true to their families.\u0022 His wife was more ambivalent. \u0022I don\u0027t think it\u0027s the best thing, no—but...I can\u0027t take on the burden of everybody else\u0027s lives,\u0022 she offered. Both conceded they would be \u0022devastated\u0022 if the other used its services.\u000A\u000ABut whatever is driving women to these infidelity sites, the one notion nearly everyone agrees with is that our understanding of female sexuality is outdated. As Dan Slater wrote in a New York Times op-ed this year, some studies have shown that women report more sexual partners than men, are less selective in certain contexts, and are nearly as likely to accept casual sex from a celebrity or from a close friend they\u0027ve been told is good in the sack.\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s also a keeping-up-with-the-Mrs.-Robinsons pressure, especially among wives who have at least as much power as their spouses, says Kate Bolick, author of The Atlantic\u0027s much discussed \u0022All the Single Ladies\u0022 cover article. \u0022When I\u0027ve watched women cheat in their thirties, they\u0027re not necessarily unhappy with their husbands, but they\u0027re all alpha women, and they feel entitled to what they want,\u0022 she says. \u0022If you\u0027re a 34-year-old woman successful in your career and you\u0027ve got a great husband but you\u0027re bored sexually, and you watch all your single friends run around town having sex, you think you should be able to have that, too.\u0022\u000A\u000AI ask Bolick to scroll through her phone and count the number of women she knows of who have had affairs. \u0022Fifteen!\u0022 she announces.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AGloria\u000A\u000AGloria is a slender, pretty woman in her late forties whom I meet on a Friday night at The Bar Downstairs at the Andaz hotel in midtown. She\u0027s had two enjoyable long-term affairs with male colleagues. Recently, however, without any opportunities presenting themselves, she joined Ashley Madison. She wants to fall in love again but doesn\u0027t feel the need to leave her husband—at least not yet.\u000A\u000A\u0022There are more reasons to stay than to leave. There\u0027s still love that holds us together,\u0022 she tells me over cocktails and tapas. \u0022But I don\u0027t believe any one person ever fulfills a person\u0027s needs. And lifelong passion is extremely rare. If I left him and married someone else, it\u0027d probably just be a matter of time until I had the same situation. It\u0027s unusual for a strong sexual component to remain after a few years, and I\u0027m not willing to give up that part of my life.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AShe says she\u0027s been with \u0022publishers of magazines, CEOs, politicians, managing partners at law or investment firms\u0022—all via Ashley Madison.\u000A\u000A\u0022Politicians?\u0022 I exclaim, astonished anyone in elected office would be so brazen in the aftermath of Anthony Weiner. \u0022Can I ask what level of government?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I won\u0027t say any more,\u0022 she laughs. \u0022I like him and don\u0027t want to get him in trouble.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhereas some might get off on devising a secret rendezvous, Gloria seems to be troubled by it. \u0022I don\u0027t feel guilt about the effect of the affair,\u0022 she says. \u0022I feel guilt about the circumstances—to see someone, I need to come up with an outright lie.\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve gotten a taste of how physically and mentally fatiguing it can be to set up these arrangements, and I\u0027m not even leading a double life. Gloria is the third woman I\u0027ve met up with in about ten days, and I\u0027ve had long phone calls with three others, not to mention a seventy-text spree with a woman in Albany (which included plenty of boastful sexts on her end, like: \u0022This little fat girl knows how to play. You\u0027ll see when we walk into [REDACTED SPORTS BAR]. I give it 5 min before someone hits on me. Not even. Lmfao.\u0022) We tend to imagine infidelity as a state of heightened eroticism, three-hour binges of lingerie and champagne in a hotel suite. We don\u0027t think of the far greater chunk of time the cheater spends lying to his or her spouse, questioning the marriage\u0027s foundation, and seeking an exit strategy. There\u0027s nothing dramatic (in an exciting way) or sexy about that.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASarah and Laura\u000A\u000AOne early-thirties woman, Sarah, has just met a date—she\u0027s ambivalent about him—before she joins me for lunch at the French bistro L\u0027Express near Gramercy Park. She goes for eight-to-ten-mile runs several times a week and posts a semi-blurry photo of her cute, corn-fed face on her profile, one of the few women to do so.\u000A\u000ASarah tells me she\u0027s had \u0022ten years of boredom. I want to have fun.\u0022 She married young to appease her religious parents and finds her bourgeois life and sexually unadventurous husband \u0022suffocating.\u0022 As with most of the women I\u0027ve interviewed, she labels herself \u0022more of the controller\u0022 in the relationship: \u0022I earn more. I repair everything. I fix up the house.\u0022\u000A\u000AShe joined Ashley Madison two months ago to \u0022sort of test the waters,\u0022 she says. The first man she met on the site came over to her house for their first meeting while her husband was on a trip. She met him on the steps to her home, and with minimum conversation they progressed to the shower and the bedroom. \u0022It was the hottest sex of my life,\u0022 she says, beaming. \u0022Porn-star sex.\u0022 Why haven\u0027t they met again since then? \u0022He\u0027s Muslim, and it\u0027s Ramadan, so I haven\u0027t talked to him for a few weeks.\u0022 She laughs. \u0022It\u0027s so hypocritical—all this holier-than-thou stuff.\u0022\u000A\u000ASarah also has a forensic-science degree, and when she mentions a hotel she visited during her affair, I ask if it was the meatpacking district\u0027s notorious Liberty Inn, with its reasonably priced two-hour rooms. She says no, but reveals a fun fact: Hotels aren\u0027t required to wash comforters. \u0022So when you go to a hotel, always pull the comforter off, because there are semen stains all over,\u0022 she advises.\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t mention these lax hygienic standards when Laura, around the same age, tells me about the time a professional athlete she was sleeping with got busted after his wife discovered the receipt for their $600 night in Union Square\u0027s W hotel. Laura has called me from her corporate office on a Monday night shortly after we exchange an Ashley Madison e-mail. A few minutes in, she orders a secretary who has entered her office not to interrupt her conference call.\u000A\u000ALike Sarah, she\u0027s been with her unambitious husband for around a decade and is not only sexually uninspired and no longer in love but also chafing under the shackles of her conservative upbringing and professional demeanor. Her rebellion includes sexting her boyfriends under the table at dinner with her husband.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHer views on gender relations are of a modified-traditionalist strain. \u0022In the workplace, it should be equal,\u0022 she says. \u0022But in the house, the only way it works is if there\u0027s a strong masculine and feminine component. You need to give your husband a blow job every day. He should feel like a king. Seeking it out in my sexual life is to make up for it in my real life. I want my husband to be dominant and more successful. I don\u0027t want to be the man in the relationship.\u0022\u000A\u000ALaura also expresses a level of self-esteem that many might envy. \u0022I lost a lot of weight, and then I realized that I\u0027m hot. All of a sudden, people were asking if I\u0027m a movie star—I get that every day,\u0022 she tells me, along with, \u0022Everyone tells me that I\u0027m amazingly good at sex, that it\u0027s beyond anything they\u0027ve ever experienced.\u0022\u000A\u000ANinety minutes in, she\u0027s still hesitant to reveal too much, though, so I try to persuade her to meet me that night. It\u0027s already 9 P.M. She asks if we can do so two nights later when she\u0027s less tired. I don\u0027t trust that she\u0027ll follow through. Throughout our call, she\u0027s told me several times that her hands are sweaty from confessing her secret to me. So like any respectable journalist hoping to secure a meeting with a reluctant source, I play to her proclivities.\u000A\u000A\u0022I think you like talking about this in your office,\u0022 I suggest.\u000A\u000A\u0022I do like it,\u0022 she admits. \u0022I feel kind of naughty telling you. Like I\u0027m doing something really bad. Sometimes I wish I could tell people. But I feel like such a deviant. Because it turns me on. Being bad.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022And I think you like the idea of reading about yourself in an article.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You\u0027re right, I do,\u0022 she says. \u0022I want to take it to lunch with my girlfriends\u0022—suburbanites she\u0027s dismissed as Keeping Up with the Kardashians-watching Stepford wives—\u0022and discuss how shocking it is that people like this are out there and they\u0027re such whores, and make a big deal out of it and see what everyone says. I like the idea of feeling like a whore.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Of feeling naughty,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000AShe pauses, then says, \u0022It\u0027d be really naughty if I were to fuck a GQ journalist.\u0022 A few seconds pass. My heartbeat quickens. Various boundaries—professional and personal—are shifting under my feet. It feels dramatic.\u000A\u000ALaura breaks the silence. \u0022Not that I\u0027m offering,\u0022 she says with a small, ambiguous laugh. \u0022I\u0027m not.\u0022\u000A\u000AShe tells me I have an attractive voice. I deepen it, make it more gravelly, promise to reimburse her for a cab down to a meeting spot.\u000A\u000A\u0022Stop talking in your sexy voice,\u0022 she giggles. \u0022You\u0027re using your sexual powers against me to get me to meet with you.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd there goes my Pulitzer eligibility. After a few quick calls—and a request I immediately reject to send a photo of my genitalia for insurance against the possible exposure of her identity—she says she\u0027s told her husband she\u0027s going running and agrees to meet me. I sprint to an ATM and withdraw money for her cab, then jump in a taxi myself to the twenty-four-hour L\u0027Express and sit at the bar. She calls me as I\u0027m on my second vodka tonic. I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s to cancel or to mock me for showing up, but she says she\u0027s en route. Ten minutes later she walks in. I can\u0027t describe her appearance, except to say that she has listed her weight in the mid-one-hundreds, calls herself \u0022fit,\u0022 and wears corporate attire. I can see how she would be some men\u0027s type; she\u0027s not exactly mine, but I could also envision a scenario in which, if I were single and feeling lascivious, something might happen.\u000A\u000AAfter a few mojitos, the details pour out about her liaisons, generally with men who are \u0022very rich and older and dominant\u0022—with whom, she says, \u0022I feel like an expensive toy.\u0022 There\u0027s the gentleman who, during a two-hour lunch date at Babbo, Mario Batali\u0027s West Village restaurant, fingered her under the table. And the spiritual leader who hit on her in his house of worship. And the husband\u0027s friend she flirts with to get back at his obnoxious wife. And her on-again, off-again relationship with the W-frequenting athlete. And the supposed Harvard professor whose classroom she visited one day: \u0022The sex sucked. He folded my clothes neatly over the podium, and he just bent me over a chair and fucked me kind of roughly.\u0022 When she tells me he\u0027s still working on his dissertation, I feel obligated to inform her that she had podium-sex with a lowly graduate student.\u000A\u000AShe presses her leg against mine and periodically leans in close to whisper, but generally comports herself more properly than she did on the phone. She texts her husband after midnight that she wants some more alone time. At 1 A.M. she shows me her phone. \u0022Look, he hasn\u0027t even responded,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000ALaura and I stumble out of the bistro at two in the morning. We walk into a bank so I can withdraw $60 more to pay for her long cab ride home, back to the suburbs. \u0022I want to see your apartment,\u0022 she says when we come back out on the street. \u0022You\u0027re living my dream, living in Manhattan.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI could do this if I wanted. I could take this woman I just met home to my apartment and have sex with her and not tell my girlfriend, and Laura would concoct a wild story for her husband, as she did to cover up her W hotel romp. Whatever feels romantically or sexually lacking in or injurious to your life—your current relationship, the girls in high school who didn\u0027t give you the time of day, stultifying routine—can be compensated for, at least for a few hours, in the fashion of so many unsatisfied people: through clandestine congress.\u000A\u000ABut I don\u0027t want to do it. Other than Megan, the only one who is open with her husband, the women I have met are all, by their own admission, either deeply unhappy or deeply dishonest with their spouses. Monogamy may defy certain biological imperatives and may not make as much sense for modern eighty-year life spans, but that\u0027s the contract you sign up for; if it isn\u0027t for you, then opt out or marry someone new.\u000A\u000A\u0022I really can\u0027t show you my apartment,\u0022 I tell Laura as I hail her a taxi. Tomorrow she\u0027ll e-mail me that she wrote an essay about our encounter on the ride home; a week later, that she\u0027s left her husband and that \u0022I bet the next time that I do have mind-blowing sex it will not be with someone who is married.\u0022 Then, a few weeks after, that she\u0027s quit her job. She wants to be a writer, and asks me for advice.\u000A\u000AFor most, is cheating just about sex or sexual ego? I would still submit that the latter is the case more for men than for women. But with Laura, it\u0027s about desire for another life altogether. There\u0027s still no Ashley Madison for that.\u000A\u000ATeddy Wayne (@TeddyWayne1999) lives in Manhattan and __is the author of, most recently, the novel The Love Song of Jonny Valentine.

Have an affair.&#xAE;&quot; You&#x2019;ve probably heard of it. But you probably don&#x2019;t know anyone on it&#x2014;or at least anyone who admits to being on it.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.6">Because if you go on the site, you&#x2019;ll find a lot of avatars adorned with a simple drawing of a woman&#x2019;s face and a confidential finger over pursed pink lips, with the promise of additional &quot;Private Showcase&quot; photos, viewable only if the member sends you a &quot;key.&quot; Many profiles are eloquent and demure, asking men to compose thoughtful missives and to refrain from sending erection photos. But a number are either fake, or appear to be from sex workers, or are written like the following: &quot;to have a well built guy with a huge spear shove it in my tight MILF [orifice not anatomically designed for sexual intercourse] in front of my husband all night long!!!!!!!! TO BE TREATED LIKE I WAS THE LAST WOMAN ON EARTH BY A HUNGRY GROUP OF MEN, PREFERABLY ALL [ethnic group whose male members are often hypersexualized in American culture, due in part to a complex legacy of discrimination]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BIG THICK [rhyming masculine body part] NEED APPLY!!!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.7">Clearly I need to embellish my r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;. My first e-mail blitz, which doesn&#x2019;t specify that I&#x2019;m a journalist hoping to interview subjects, nets me a grand total of zero replies. Still got it! I change tack and name-drop <em>GQ</em> and assure recipients that their anonymity will be preserved. Most women continue to ignore me, some flatly respond no, and several are dubious about my identity.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.8">Yet a few replies roll in. One is from Megan. (Identifying details have been obscured or altered slightly to ensure anonymity, and all names are fictitious.) She lists her weight at well over 200 pounds, her limits are &quot;Anything Goes,&quot; and her tagline is &quot;I&#x2019;m too much for you.&quot; And what is she looking for? &quot;Sex.... I&#x2019;m not here at AM to meet someone for the opera, I assure you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.9">&quot;Just to be clear, is this a sexy date or a formal interview?&quot; she writes. &quot;Ideally we could combine the two.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.a">What the hell is going on here? What, exactly, is compelling these married women to set up &quot;sexy dates&quot; in droves, aside from easy Internet access? For years, our collective narrative of the errant housewife has run thusly: Neglected by her aloof or abusive husband and dying a slow death from her suburban prison, she falls into the arms of a dashing, romantic gentleman. In myths, novels, and films, from Helen of Troy to Hester Prynne in <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> to Diane Lane in 2002&#x2019;s<em> Unfaithful, </em>the affair of the rare philandering female is the centerpiece of the story, and its punishments are draconian (the Trojan War, ostracism and branding with an A, being cast in <em>Must Love Dogs</em>). On the other hand, just try to name every single guy who has cheated on <em>Mad Men</em>&#x2014;and gotten away with it. Then again, <em>Mad Men </em>takes place fifty years ago.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.b">In the real world, with greater professional equality between the genders and third-wave-feminist sexual liberation, are women cheating for the same reason that men have throughout history, as Megan&#x2019;s profile suggests&#x2014;that is, to sate their sex drives and gratify their egos?</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.c">In the spirit of this gender reversal, I invite you to picture me as Carrie Bradshaw, sprawled out on her bed with her PowerBook G3, as she voice-overs, &quot;I couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder: Are unfaithful women the new adulterous men? Has Casanova turned into...Cassandra?&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.d"><hr></div><div class="embed h4" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.e"><h4>Megan</h4></div><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.f">Megan has picked Coppelia, a Latin American diner at the border of Chelsea and the West Village in Manhattan, and she&#x2019;s waiting in a booth when I arrive. She recognizes me from my profile photo, and I slide in across from her. She&#x2019;s around 40, wearing casual, loose-fitting clothes and a pleasant smile. In short, she doesn&#x2019;t fit the portrait of the promiscuous, inconstant woman cast as the adulteress in Hollywood dramas.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.g">I thank her for meeting me. She says it&#x2019;s no big deal. It is, though&#x2014;if her identity were somehow unmasked, it could torpedo her high-powered career: She&#x2019;s worked for one of the most prominent political figures in the country and nearly ended up in Obama&#x2019;s administration.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.h">Over cold Cusque&amp;#xF1;a beers on a hot July afternoon, Megan drops the professional mien. &quot;I&#x2019;m a dirty old man trapped in a woman&#x2019;s body,&quot; she says. &quot;I lust after younger men the way dirty old men lust after younger girls. I <em>get</em> dirty old men. I&#x2019;m looking for eye candy. I&#x2019;m very shallow.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.i">She tells me that she&#x2019;s been corporeally disloyal in relationships since she started having sex at 16 and has don&#x2019;t-ask, don&#x2019;t-tell permission to frolic with other lovers from her &quot;nerd&quot; husband of nearly two decades, with whom she has several children.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.j">&quot;He can barely handle me, and he&#x2019;s super-vanilla,&quot; Megan says. &quot;But he&#x2019;s also a fantastic guy and father. We have a really happy and functional house.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.k">She hoped marriage would change her cheating ways, but two years later found herself straying&#x2014;as much out of a lust for life as for flesh. &quot;I find myself living my life in the third person and deciding whether it&#x2019;d be a good story.&quot; She takes a sip of beer. &quot;I want it to be dramatic.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.l">Since then, she&#x2019;s averaged one or two new men per year, with a few women sprinkled in, and in the digital age has supplemented her search with Ashley Madison, Craigslist, and CougarLife. As is customary for women on Ashley Madison, she gets bombarded by suitors, then rejects about 90 percent of those she meets. To her, the main contrast in the libidos of the genders is not their size but their pickiness.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.m"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558301c509f0bee56440d836/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-2.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-2.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;t=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-2.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;t=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558301c509f0bee56440d836%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-2.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-2.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558301c509f0bee56440d836%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-2.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.n">&quot;Women want their affairs to have sexual attraction,&quot; she opines. &quot;Men just want their affairs to have a vagina.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.o">For some reason, a professional photographer sets up a tripod and camera at the entrance and walks past us several times. Megan seems discomfited. I assure her the photographer is not with me.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.p">Her friends (granted, a self-selecting cohort) are just as randy as she is, though not all seek out external solutions&#x2014;to their detriment, she believes. &quot;They&#x2019;re all unhappy with the amount of sex they&#x2019;re getting&#x2014;the ones who are still married,&quot; she says. &quot;I feel like I&#x2019;m the healthiest one out there. The ones who&#x2019;ve started playing around are much happier.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.q">But what about the guilt? &quot;I really consider it a favor to my husband. My marriage would be in shambles if I wasn&#x2019;t playing outside the marriage.&quot; Such playing is not without its risks; she&#x2019;s fallen for men before, she admits, and says heartbreak is part of the game.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.r">Megan prefers younger men whom she can think of as her &quot;boy toys&#x2014;my playthings.&quot; She asks how old I am. I tell her 33, and she points at me and says, &quot;That&#x2019;s my perfect age.&quot; Later she clasps her hand over mine for a few seconds when I make a joke. Soon after, she removes my glasses without asking permission. &quot;Your glasses are so clouded, I need to clean them,&quot; she explains, wiping them on her shirt.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.s">Megan also has some olfactory qualifications. &quot;I need to smell men,&quot; she tells me. &quot;They need to smell good to me: healthy, alive, confident. I can smell fear; I want them to smell like they deserve me. I&#x2019;ve met guys who are theoretically attractive, but they don&#x2019;t smell right.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.t">There&#x2019;s a pregnant pause; we both know what&#x2019;s coming next. &quot;Do you want to smell me?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.u">&quot;I haven&#x2019;t really put my nose into your neck, which is where the smell holds,&quot; she says, and stands to the side of the table. I join her, expecting her to crane just her nostrils into me, but she embraces me in a hug, pulls me tightly into her expansive bosom, and burrows her face into the crook of my neck for a deep whiff.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.v">&quot;You smell good,&quot; she says with the cool detachment of a pheromone connoisseur, eyeing me in what seems to be a new light.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.w">As our interview winds down, she asks what my romantic situation is. I tell her I have a girlfriend. &quot;Are you in an open relationship?&quot; she asks. No, I answer. &quot;Too bad,&quot; she says softly.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.x"><hr></div><div class="embed h4" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.y"><h4>Ashley</h4></div><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.z">&quot;The women&#x2019;s movement into the workplace was the first massive jump into unfaithfulness,&quot; says Noel Biderman, CEO of Ashley Madison. &quot;The more financial independence women have, the more it correlates to how unfaithful they&#x2019;ll be.&quot; When Biderman launched the site in 2001, he predicted &quot;that the Internet would be the second massive jump and usher in an era where women would behave like men. Ten years later, having built a female brand, I think I was right.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.10">Ashley Madison now says it has approximately 6 million active members in thirty countries (about 4 million in the United States). Revenues in 2012 were $100 million&#x2014;more than decent, but still far behind the titans of online dating like Match.com and eHarmony. While the overall membership skews 70 percent male, Biderman claims gender parity among people in their thirties (which translates to lots of lecherous 65-year-old men hitting on 30-year-old women).</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.11">Biderman says he is happily married and regards his venture as a release valve for those in sexually unfulfilling, but otherwise effective, unions. In a joint interview with his wife on Australian TV&#x2019;s <em>A Current Affair</em> (ha!), he defended his company by saying, &quot;I would rather see people pursue [an affair] and stay true to their families.&quot; His wife was more ambivalent. &quot;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s the best thing, no&#x2014;but...I can&#x2019;t take on the burden of everybody else&#x2019;s lives,&quot; she offered. Both conceded they would be &quot;devastated&quot; if the other used its services.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.12">But whatever is driving women to these infidelity sites, the one notion nearly everyone agrees with is that our understanding of female sexuality is outdated. As Dan Slater wrote in a <em>New York Times</em> op-ed this year, some studies have shown that women report more sexual partners than men, are less selective in certain contexts, and are nearly as likely to accept casual sex from a celebrity or from a close friend they&#x2019;ve been told is good in the sack.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.13">There&#x2019;s also a keeping-up-with-the-Mrs.-Robinsons pressure, especially among wives who have at least as much power as their spouses, says Kate Bolick, author of <em>The Atlantic&#x2019;</em>s much discussed &quot;All the Single Ladies&quot; cover article. &quot;When I&#x2019;ve watched women cheat in their thirties, they&#x2019;re not necessarily unhappy with their husbands, but they&#x2019;re all alpha women, and they feel entitled to what they want,&quot; she says. &quot;If you&#x2019;re a 34-year-old woman successful in your career and you&#x2019;ve got a great husband but you&#x2019;re bored sexually, and you watch all your single friends run around town having sex, you think you should be able to have that, too.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.14">I ask Bolick to scroll through her phone and count the number of women she knows of who have had affairs. &quot;Fifteen!&quot; she announces.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.15"><hr></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.16"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558301c53655c24c6c956179/master/w_600/entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-03.jpg" alt="entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;t=entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;t=entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558301c53655c24c6c956179%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-03.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558301c53655c24c6c956179%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-03.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><div class="embed h4" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.17"><h4>Gloria</h4></div><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.18">Gloria is a slender, pretty woman in her late forties whom I meet on a Friday night at The Bar Downstairs at the Andaz hotel in midtown. She&#x2019;s had two enjoyable long-term affairs with male colleagues. Recently, however, without any opportunities presenting themselves, she joined Ashley Madison. She wants to fall in love again but doesn&#x2019;t feel the need to leave her husband&#x2014;at least not yet.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.19">&quot;There are more reasons to stay than to leave. There&#x2019;s still love that holds us together,&quot; she tells me over cocktails and tapas. &quot;But I don&#x2019;t believe any one person ever fulfills a person&#x2019;s needs. And lifelong passion is extremely rare. If I left him and married someone else, it&#x2019;d probably just be a matter of time until I had the same situation. It&#x2019;s unusual for a strong sexual component to remain after a few years, and I&#x2019;m not willing to give up that part of my life.&quot;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1a"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558301c509f0bee56440d83d/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-3.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-3.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;t=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-3.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;t=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-3.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558301c509f0bee56440d83d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-3.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-3.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558301c509f0bee56440d83d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-3.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-3.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1b">She says she&#x2019;s been with &quot;publishers of magazines, CEOs, politicians, managing partners at law or investment firms&quot;&#x2014;all via Ashley Madison.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1c">&quot;Politicians?&quot; I exclaim, astonished anyone in elected office would be so brazen in the aftermath of Anthony Weiner. &quot;Can I ask what level of government?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1d">&quot;I won&#x2019;t say any more,&quot; she laughs. &quot;I like him and don&#x2019;t want to get him in trouble.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1e">Whereas some might get off on devising a secret rendezvous, Gloria seems to be troubled by it. &quot;I don&#x2019;t feel guilt about the effect of the affair,&quot; she says. &quot;I feel guilt about the circumstances&#x2014;to see someone, I need to come up with an outright lie.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1f">I&#x2019;ve gotten a taste of how physically and mentally fatiguing it can be to set up these arrangements, and I&#x2019;m not even leading a double life. Gloria is the third woman I&#x2019;ve met up with in about ten days, and I&#x2019;ve had long phone calls with three others, not to mention a seventy-text spree with a woman in Albany (which included plenty of boastful sexts on her end, like: &quot;This little fat girl knows how to play. You&#x2019;ll see when we walk into [REDACTED SPORTS BAR]. I give it 5 min before someone hits on me. Not even. Lmfao.&quot;) We tend to imagine infidelity as a state of heightened eroticism, three-hour binges of lingerie and champagne in a hotel suite. We don&#x2019;t think of the far greater chunk of time the cheater spends lying to his or her spouse, questioning the marriage&#x2019;s foundation, and seeking an exit strategy. There&#x2019;s nothing dramatic (in an exciting way) or sexy about that.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><hr></div><div class="embed h4" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><h4>Sarah and Laura</h4></div><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1i">One early-thirties woman, Sarah, has just met a date&#x2014;she&#x2019;s ambivalent about him&#x2014;before she joins me for lunch at the French bistro L&#x2019;Express near Gramercy Park. She goes for eight-to-ten-mile runs several times a week and posts a semi-blurry photo of her cute, corn-fed face on her profile, one of the few women to do so.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1j">Sarah tells me she&#x2019;s had &quot;ten years of boredom. I want to have fun.&quot; She married young to appease her religious parents and finds her bourgeois life and sexually unadventurous husband &quot;suffocating.&quot; As with most of the women I&#x2019;ve interviewed, she labels herself &quot;more of the controller&quot; in the relationship: &quot;I earn more. I repair everything. I fix up the house.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1k">She joined Ashley Madison two months ago to &quot;sort of test the waters,&quot; she says. The first man she met on the site came over to her house for their first meeting while her husband was on a trip. She met him on the steps to her home, and with minimum conversation they progressed to the shower and the bedroom. &quot;It was the hottest sex of my life,&quot; she says, beaming. &quot;Porn-star sex.&quot; Why haven&#x2019;t they met again since then? &quot;He&#x2019;s Muslim, and it&#x2019;s Ramadan, so I haven&#x2019;t talked to him for a few weeks.&quot; She laughs. &quot;It&#x2019;s so hypocritical&#x2014;all this holier-than-thou stuff.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1l">Sarah also has a forensic-science degree, and when she mentions a hotel she visited during her affair, I ask if it was the meatpacking district&#x2019;s notorious Liberty Inn, with its reasonably priced two-hour rooms. She says no, but reveals a fun fact: Hotels aren&#x2019;t required to wash comforters. &quot;So when you go to a hotel, always pull the comforter off, because there are semen stains all over,&quot; she advises.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1m">I don&#x2019;t mention these lax hygienic standards when Laura, around the same age, tells me about the time a professional athlete she was sleeping with got busted after his wife discovered the receipt for their $600 night in Union Square&#x2019;s W hotel. Laura has called me from her corporate office on a Monday night shortly after we exchange an Ashley Madison e-mail. A few minutes in, she orders a secretary who has entered her office not to interrupt her conference call.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1n">Like Sarah, she&#x2019;s been with her unambitious husband for around a decade and is not only sexually uninspired and no longer in love but also chafing under the shackles of her conservative upbringing and professional demeanor. Her rebellion includes sexting her boyfriends under the table at dinner with her husband.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1o"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558301c509f0bee56440d833/master/w_600/entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-04.jpg" alt="entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-04.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;t=entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;t=entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558301c509f0bee56440d833%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-04.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558301c509f0bee56440d833%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-04.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-10-immediate-offline-boinking-online-married-ladies-seek-immediate-offline-boinking-gq-magazine-october-2013-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1p">Her views on gender relations are of a modified-traditionalist strain. &quot;In the workplace, it should be equal,&quot; she says. &quot;But in the house, the only way it works is if there&#x2019;s a strong masculine and feminine component. You need to give your husband a blow job every day. He should feel like a king. Seeking it out in my sexual life is to make up for it in my real life. I want my husband to be dominant and more successful. I don&#x2019;t want to be the man in the relationship.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1q">Laura also expresses a level of self-esteem that many might envy. &quot;I lost a lot of weight, and then I realized that I&#x2019;m hot. All of a sudden, people were asking if I&#x2019;m a movie star&#x2014;I get that every day,&quot; she tells me, along with, &quot;Everyone tells me that I&#x2019;m amazingly good at sex, that it&#x2019;s beyond anything they&#x2019;ve ever experienced.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1r">Ninety minutes in, she&#x2019;s still hesitant to reveal too much, though, so I try to persuade her to meet me that night. It&#x2019;s already 9 P.M. She asks if we can do so two nights later when she&#x2019;s less tired. I don&#x2019;t trust that she&#x2019;ll follow through. Throughout our call, she&#x2019;s told me several times that her hands are sweaty from confessing her secret to me. So like any respectable journalist hoping to secure a meeting with a reluctant source, I play to her proclivities.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1s">&quot;I think you like talking about this in your office,&quot; I suggest.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1t">&quot;I do like it,&quot; she admits. &quot;I feel kind of naughty telling you. Like I&#x2019;m doing something really bad. Sometimes I wish I could tell people. But I feel like such a deviant. Because it turns me on. Being bad.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1u">&quot;And I think you like the idea of reading about yourself in an article.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1v">&quot;You&#x2019;re right, I do,&quot; she says. &quot;I want to take it to lunch with my girlfriends&quot;&#x2014;suburbanites she&#x2019;s dismissed as <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em>-watching Stepford wives&#x2014;&quot;and discuss how shocking it is that people like this are out there and they&#x2019;re such whores, and make a big deal out of it and see what everyone says. I like the idea of feeling like a whore.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1w">&quot;Of feeling naughty,&quot; I say.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1x">She pauses, then says, &quot;It&#x2019;d be really naughty if I were to fuck a <em>GQ</em> journalist.&quot; A few seconds pass. My heartbeat quickens. Various boundaries&#x2014;professional and personal&#x2014;are shifting under my feet. It feels dramatic.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1y">Laura breaks the silence. &quot;Not that I&#x2019;m offering,&quot; she says with a small, ambiguous laugh. &quot;I&#x2019;m not.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.1z">She tells me I have an attractive voice. I deepen it, make it more gravelly, promise to reimburse her for a cab down to a meeting spot.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.20">&quot;Stop talking in your sexy voice,&quot; she giggles. &quot;You&#x2019;re using your sexual powers against me to get me to meet with you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.21">And there goes my Pulitzer eligibility. After a few quick calls&#x2014;and a request I immediately reject to send a photo of my genitalia for insurance against the possible exposure of her identity&#x2014;she says she&#x2019;s told her husband she&#x2019;s going running and agrees to meet me. I sprint to an ATM and withdraw money for her cab, then jump in a taxi myself to the twenty-four-hour L&#x2019;Express and sit at the bar. She calls me as I&#x2019;m on my second vodka tonic. I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s to cancel or to mock me for showing up, but she says she&#x2019;s en route. Ten minutes later she walks in. I can&#x2019;t describe her appearance, except to say that she has listed her weight in the mid-one-hundreds, calls herself &quot;fit,&quot; and wears corporate attire. I can see how she would be some men&#x2019;s type; she&#x2019;s not exactly mine, but I could also envision a scenario in which, if I were single and feeling lascivious, something might happen.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.22">After a few mojitos, the details pour out about her liaisons, generally with men who are &quot;very rich and older and dominant&quot;&#x2014;with whom, she says, &quot;I feel like an expensive toy.&quot; There&#x2019;s the gentleman who, during a two-hour lunch date at Babbo, Mario Batali&#x2019;s West Village restaurant, fingered her under the table. And the spiritual leader who hit on her in his house of worship. And the husband&#x2019;s friend she flirts with to get back at his obnoxious wife. And her on-again, off-again relationship with the W-frequenting athlete. And the supposed Harvard professor whose classroom she visited one day: &quot;The sex sucked. He folded my clothes neatly over the podium, and he just bent me over a chair and fucked me kind of roughly.&quot; When she tells me he&#x2019;s still working on his dissertation, I feel obligated to inform her that she had podium-sex with a lowly graduate student.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.23">She presses her leg against mine and periodically leans in close to whisper, but generally comports herself more properly than she did on the phone. She texts her husband after midnight that she wants some more alone time.

We walk into a bank so I can withdraw $60 more to pay for her long cab ride home, back to the suburbs. &quot;I want to see your apartment,&quot; she says when we come back out on the street. &quot;You&#x2019;re living my dream, living in Manhattan.&quot;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.25"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558301c53655c24c6c95617d/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-4.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-4.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;t=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-4.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;t=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-4.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558301c53655c24c6c95617d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-4.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-4.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fashley-madison-affair-cheating-site&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558301c53655c24c6c95617d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-4.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2013-10-ashley-maddison-stat-4.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.26">I could do this if I wanted. I could take this woman I just met home to my apartment and have sex with her and not tell my girlfriend, and Laura would concoct a wild story for her husband, as she did to cover up her W hotel romp. Whatever feels romantically or sexually lacking in or injurious to your life&#x2014;your current relationship, the girls in high school who didn&#x2019;t give you the time of day, stultifying routine&#x2014;can be compensated for, at least for a few hours, in the fashion of so many unsatisfied people: through clandestine congress.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.27">But I don&#x2019;t want to do it. Other than Megan, the only one who is open with her husband, the women I have met are all, by their own admission, either deeply unhappy or deeply dishonest with their spouses. Monogamy may defy certain biological imperatives and may not make as much sense for modern eighty-year life spans, but that&#x2019;s the contract you sign up for; if it isn&#x2019;t for you, then opt out or marry someone new.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.28">&quot;I really can&#x2019;t show you my apartment,&quot; I tell Laura as I hail her a taxi. Tomorrow she&#x2019;ll e-mail me that she wrote an essay about our encounter on the ride home; a week later, that she&#x2019;s left her husband and that &quot;I bet the next time that I do have mind-blowing sex it will not be with someone who is married.&quot; Then, a few weeks after, that she&#x2019;s quit her job. She wants to be a writer, and asks me for advice.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.29">For most, is cheating just about sex or sexual ego? I would still submit that the latter is the case more for men than for women. But with Laura, it&#x2019;s about desire for another life altogether. There&#x2019;s still no Ashley Madison for that.</p><p data-reactid=".onfkyj7egw.1.1.0.0.4.2a"><a href="../contributors/teddy-wayne">Teddy Wayne</a> (<a
