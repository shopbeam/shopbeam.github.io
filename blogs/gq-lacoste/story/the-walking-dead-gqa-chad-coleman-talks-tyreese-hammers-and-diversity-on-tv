  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWhen The Walking Dead returns for its fourth season premiere this Sunday at 10 p.m. on AMC, you might think it\u0027s a different show for the first few minutes. With The Governor vanquished (at least temporarily), the remaining survivors from Woodbury have joined the show\u0027s main characters in what appears to be a pretty idyllic little life behind the prison\u0027s chain-link fence. There are horses and pigs and crops in the ground providing for a few cellblocks full of folks. Now, this is The Walking Dead we\u0027re talking about, so this little slice of heaven doesn\u0027t last for too long, but it\u0027s an interesting change of pace. GQ sat down with Chad Coleman—formerly Cutty from The Wire, now the man behind fan favorite Tyreese—to discuss the new season, his iconic hammer, diversity on TV, and his favorite show growing up (the answer will surprise you).\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AGQ: Having seen the first two episodes of season four, it\u0027s almost as if you guys are trying to lull the audience into a false sense of security similar to the one the people in the prison are experiencing. Was that intentional?\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: Yeah, I think so. Coming off the end of a nightmarish season three, the producers wanted to get a sense of trying to build a new community at the prison. Everybody\u0027s trying to find their place and some sense of normalcy.\u000A\u000AGQ: It seems like everyone has calmed down and the prison has become this idyllic place. Things do get pretty crazy, though.\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: You know, as they say, the calm before the storm. [Laughs]\u000A\u000AGQ: Last year\u0027s big story was the Governor, and the arrival of Tyreese and Michonne. Fans have been waiting a long time to see all that. How do you possibly top that this year?\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: It\u0027s more epic. It\u0027s even more gut-wrenching. Everybody is being pushed to the max. There was some level of respite in the fact that it wasn\u0027t balls to the wall, after my introduction, but now everybody is going to get turned inside out. It\u0027s just going to be relentless.\u000A\u000AGQ: I feel like the Tyreese we\u0027re seeing in the beginning of season four is much closer to the Tyreese people were hoping to see from the comics.\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: This was all a part of the plan, and definitely everything that they (Robert Kirkman and Scott Gimple and everyone else) said they were going to deliver for this character is definitely being delivered. Everybody has high regard for the comic book, and who he was in that format, but when you get an opportunity to take a second pass at a character and you have great writers, you want to bring something more to the table. We want the comic book audience to be incredibly satisfied so it\u0027s not a rehash, but it\u0027s more like Tyreese 3.0.\u000A\u000AGQ: Did you feel more pressure when you were first introduced, or going into the new season?\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: I try to steer away from pressure. I feel the challenge of the stakes. The stakes are incredibly high, so I feel the challenge to meet the epic creative heights that have been thrown my way. I live for it and obviously they felt the aesthetic of me as an actor could definitely fill the shoes, but it\u0027s just epic, man. It\u0027s awesome. It\u0027s off the scales.\u000A\u000AGQ: You went from being a fan favorite on The Wire to now being a fan favorite on The Walking Dead. Is that luck, or just hard work?\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: Both. You put the work in and, of course, you want the audience to be able to receive you and recognize and appreciate the work you do. That happened and that was the gateway to this role. Robert Kirkman is a huge fan of The Wire, as are many of the ecutive producers on the show, so that was kind of a precursor for me. To be able to step into this one is incredibly awesome. So far, so good.\u000A\u000AGQ: You even get to have a bit of a love interest in the beginning of this season. That must have been a nice change from killing zombies all day.\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: Absolutely. The stakes are high on that, too. In this world, with everything going on, to put your heart on the line is just as big as having to deal with zombies or having to deal with a villain like the Governor. How much security do you have when you begin a relationship like that? Most people think longevity and, in this world, you just don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen around the corner. Just like you see in Glenn and Maggie, it\u0027s a brave thing to do. It also gives the audience something else to identify with and root for, and it can make them feel vulnerable as well. [Laughs] Hoping upon hope that they can make it through.\u000A\u000AGQ: I have to ask about the iconic hammer. How many hammers do you have on set there?\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: [Laughs] It works two ways: You have to have the fake hammer, obviously, if I\u0027m going to be making contact. So I\u0027ve gone through maybe four or five of those. It\u0027s a lot of fun, because I can just really go for it. It\u0027s also weird, because when you really think about it, a hammer is probably one of more gruesome ways to kill somebody. It\u0027s a hell of a way to take them out. So, yeah, I\u0027ve gone through about four or five. It\u0027s an adrenaline rush. When you hit it, and hit it right, it\u0027s really powerful. It gets everybody charged up.\u000A\u000AGQ: Does the show going through several different showrunners affect the cast at all? \u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: I can tell you that I was a fan of Glen Mazzara. No question about it. I really dig the guy and his pedigree and track record. But the plan wasn\u0027t for my character to put his foot on the gas right away, so I didn\u0027t get to experience a lot of his gifts in that way. But Scott Gimple is obviously just an amazing storyteller. So, no, it doesn\u0027t really affect us. We\u0027re fortunate to have an abundance of talent over here. It really only affected me in that, \u0022Damn, I really wanted to work with Glen.\u0022\u000A\u000AGQ: Up until recently with Michonne and Tyreese, The Walking Dead didn\u0027t have the best track record with keeping their African-American characters alive. Was there any concern on your part about that when you signed on?\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: No, no. These people have high artistic integrity. They\u0027re incredibly creative people who are not in the business of exclusion. No way. None of these people. These are my neighbors. They know my kid. Even though sometimes perception is one thing but, come on, everybody gets it on this show. Andrea was taken out and many more preceding that.\u000A\u000AI understood where my African-American folks were coming from, but at the same time, the comic book was written and laid out the way it was, and those other characters were never meant to be that integral or in the epicenter of the story. So people like myself and Michonne, as you can see (and you\u0027ll see even further with me), look at what she\u0027s been given to do. It\u0027s pretty amazing stuff. Even the five episodes I did last season, I liked the color and the flavoring of this character. I think it\u0027s someone that African-Americans can be proud of. Even more so this coming season.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you feel like the landscape in TV overall is changing as well, with shows like Netflix\u0027s Orange is the New Black being so diverse?\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: I hope so, man. I\u0027m always cautious, but I just hope that people continue to evolve and be the best humanists we can be and recognize that there are many different stories that we can tell. Let\u0027s have a fair representation across the board and let\u0027s just tell dynamic stories. At some point, we can be proud that we all keep evolving in this industry to where we may be able to quell some of that conversation.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you ever get a chance to watch TV yourself?\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: Right now I\u0027ve got a three-month-old, and the work has been incredibly intense so I really haven\u0027t had a chance to watch too much. There are so many things I would love to catch up on though.\u000A\u000AGQ: Is there any show that you grew up watching that you always wished you could have been on?\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: Oh, man. Hmm. Oh! Fame!\u000A\u000AGQ: [Laughs] That is probably the last show I would have guessed you\u0027d say. \u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: [Laughs] I was just a big artistic geek like that. I know, I know. Growing up, I fell in love with the theater early on and I was going to after-school programs, doing theater, and learning about Stanislavski and method and all that. So when I watched Fame, I was like, \u0022Wow. I wish I could be on that show.\u0022 [Laughs] My physicality now is a lot different, but I was 5\u00278\u0022, 115 pounds back then.\u000A\u000AGQ: Once The Walking Dead has run its course, do you plan to move more toward film work?\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: I don\u0027t mind going both ways with it, because there\u0027s so much incredible storytelling going on in television, but that\u0027s my goal. I always wanted to push towards features and major roles. I\u0027ve made a few appearances in some big movies, but I hope The Walking Dead will help in that regard.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you have a favorite memory of your time on the show so far, either on-screen or off?\u000A\u000A Chad Coleman: When we went shot the introduction of the character, it was just crazy because it was pouring. It was raining so hard that we were forgetting our lines. The ground was so moist that trees were just tipping over, and we had to get it done. That was one of the first moments where it was like, \u0022Wow. These guys don\u0027t mess around.\u0022 [Laughs]",

Walking Dead</em> returns for its fourth season premiere this Sunday at 10 p.m. on AMC, you might think it&apos;s a different show for the first few minutes. With The Governor vanquished (at least temporarily), the remaining survivors from Woodbury have joined the show&apos;s main characters in what appears to be a pretty idyllic little life behind the prison&apos;s chain-link fence. There are horses and pigs and crops in the ground providing for a few cellblocks full of folks. Now, this <em>is</em> <em>The Walking Dead</em> we&apos;re talking about, so this little slice of heaven doesn&apos;t last for too long, but it&apos;s an interesting change of pace. <em>GQ</em> sat down with Chad Coleman&#x2014;formerly Cutty from <em>The Wire, </em>now the man behind fan favorite Tyreese&#x2014;to discuss the new season, his iconic hammer, diversity on TV, and his favorite show growing up (the answer will surprise you).</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>GQ: Having seen the first two episodes of season four, it&apos;s almost as if you guys are trying to lull the audience into a false sense of security similar to the one the people in the prison are experiencing. Was that intentional?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong>Yeah, I think so. Coming off the end of a nightmarish season three, the producers wanted to get a sense of trying to build a new community at the prison. Everybody&apos;s trying to find their place and some sense of normalcy.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>GQ: It seems like everyone has calmed down and the prison has become this idyllic place. Things do get pretty crazy, though.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong>You know, as they say, the calm before the storm. <em>[Laughs]</em></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>GQ: Last year&apos;s big story was the Governor, and the arrival of Tyreese and Michonne. Fans have been waiting a long time to see all that. How do you possibly top that this year?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.9"> <strong>Chad Coleman:</strong> It&apos;s more epic. It&apos;s even more gut-wrenching. Everybody is being pushed to the max. There was some level of respite in the fact that it wasn&apos;t balls to the wall, after my introduction, but now everybody is going to get turned inside out. It&apos;s just going to be relentless.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>GQ: I feel like the Tyreese we&apos;re seeing in the beginning of season four is much closer to the Tyreese people were hoping to see from the comics.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.b"> <strong>Chad Coleman:</strong> This was all a part of the plan, and definitely everything that they (Robert Kirkman and Scott Gimple and everyone else) said they were going to deliver for this character is definitely being delivered. Everybody has high regard for the comic book, and who he was in that format, but when you get an opportunity to take a second pass at a character and you have great writers, you want to bring something <em>more</em> to the table. We want the comic book audience to be incredibly satisfied so it&apos;s not a rehash, but it&apos;s more like Tyreese 3.0.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>GQ: Did you feel more pressure when you were first introduced, or going into the new season?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.d"> <strong>Chad Coleman:</strong> I try to steer away from pressure. I feel the challenge of the stakes. The stakes are incredibly high, so I feel the challenge to meet the epic creative heights that have been thrown my way. I live for it and obviously they felt the aesthetic of me as an actor could definitely fill the shoes, but it&apos;s just epic, man. It&apos;s awesome. It&apos;s off the scales.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>GQ: You went from being a fan favorite on <em>The Wire</em> to now being a fan favorite on <em>The Walking Dead</em>. Is that luck, or just hard work?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.f"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong>Both. You put the work in and, of course, you want the audience to be able to receive you and recognize and appreciate the work you do. That happened and that was the gateway to this role. Robert Kirkman is a huge fan of <em>The Wire,</em> as are many of the ecutive producers on the show, so that was kind of a precursor for me. To be able to step into this one is incredibly awesome. So far, so good.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>GQ: You even get to have a bit of a love interest in the beginning of this season. That must have been a nice change from killing zombies all day.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.h"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong>Absolutely. The stakes are high on that, too. In this world, with everything going on, to put your heart on the line is just as big as having to deal with zombies or having to deal with a villain like the Governor. How much security do you have when you begin a relationship like that? Most people think longevity and, in this world, you just don&apos;t know what&apos;s going to happen around the corner. Just like you see in Glenn and Maggie, it&apos;s a brave thing to do. It also gives the audience something else to identify with and root for, and it can make them feel vulnerable as well. <em>[Laughs]</em> Hoping upon hope that they can make it through.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>GQ: I have to ask about the iconic hammer. How many hammers do you have on set there?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.j"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong><em>[Laughs]</em> It works two ways: You have to have the fake hammer, obviously, if I&apos;m going to be making contact. So I&apos;ve gone through maybe four or five of those. It&apos;s a lot of fun, because I can just really go for it. It&apos;s also weird, because when you really think about it, a hammer is probably one of more gruesome ways to kill somebody. It&apos;s a hell of a way to take them out. So, yeah, I&apos;ve gone through about four or five. It&apos;s an adrenaline rush. When you hit it, and hit it right, it&apos;s really <em>powerful</em>. It gets everybody charged up.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>GQ: Does the show going through several different showrunners affect the cast at all? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.l"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong>I can tell you that I was a fan of Glen Mazzara. No question about it. I really dig the guy and his pedigree and track record. But the plan wasn&apos;t for my character to put his foot on the gas right away, so I didn&apos;t get to experience a lot of his gifts in that way. But Scott Gimple is obviously just an amazing storyteller. So, no, it doesn&apos;t really affect us. We&apos;re fortunate to have an abundance of talent over here. It really only affected me in that, &quot;Damn, I really wanted to work with Glen.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>GQ: Up until recently with Michonne and Tyreese, <em>The Walking Dead</em> didn&apos;t have the best track record with keeping their African-American characters alive. Was there any concern on your part about that when you signed on?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.n"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong>No, no. These people have high artistic integrity. They&apos;re incredibly creative people who are not in the business of exclusion. No way. None of these people. These are my neighbors. They know my kid. Even though sometimes perception is one thing but, come on, <em>everybody</em> gets it on this show. Andrea was taken out and many more preceding that.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.o">I understood where my African-American folks were coming from, but at the same time, the comic book was written and laid out the way it was, and those other characters were never meant to be that integral or in the epicenter of the story. So people like myself and Michonne, as you can see (and you&apos;ll see even further with me), look at what she&apos;s been given to do. It&apos;s pretty amazing stuff. Even the five episodes I did last season, I liked the color and the flavoring of this character. I think it&apos;s someone that African-Americans can be proud of. Even more so this coming season.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>GQ: Do you feel like the landscape in TV overall is changing as well, with shows like Netflix&apos;s <em>Orange is the New Black</em> being so diverse?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.q"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong>I hope so, man. I&apos;m always cautious, but I just hope that people continue to evolve and be the best humanists we can be and recognize that there are many different stories that we can tell. Let&apos;s have a fair representation across the board and let&apos;s just tell dynamic stories. At some point, we can be proud that we all keep evolving in this industry to where we <em>may</em> be able to quell some of that conversation.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>GQ: Do you ever get a chance to watch TV yourself?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.s"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong>Right now I&apos;ve got a three-month-old, and the work has been incredibly intense so I really haven&apos;t had a chance to watch too much. There are so many things I would love to catch up on though.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>GQ: Is there any show that you grew up watching that you always wished you could have been on?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.u"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong>Oh, man. Hmm. Oh! <em>Fame</em>!</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>GQ: <em>[Laughs]</em> That is probably the <em>last</em> show I would have guessed you&apos;d say. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.w"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong><em>[Laughs]</em> I was just a big artistic geek like that. I know, I know. Growing up, I fell in love with the theater early on and I was going to after-school programs, doing theater, and learning about Stanislavski and method and all that. So when I watched <em>Fame</em>, I was like, &quot;Wow. I wish I could be on that show.&quot; <em>[Laughs]</em> My physicality now is a lot different, but I was 5&apos;8&quot;, 115 pounds back then.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>GQ: Once <em>The Walking Dead</em> has run its course, do you plan to move more toward film work?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.y"> <strong>Chad Coleman:</strong> I don&apos;t mind going both ways with it, because there&apos;s so much incredible storytelling going on in television, but that&apos;s my goal. I always wanted to push towards features and major roles. I&apos;ve made a few appearances in some big movies, but I hope <em>The Walking Dead</em> will help in that regard.</p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>GQ: Do you have a favorite memory of your time on the show so far, either on-screen or off?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.4.10"> <strong>Chad Coleman: </strong>When we went shot the introduction of the character, it was just crazy because it was <em>pouring</em>. It was raining so hard that we were forgetting our lines. The ground was so moist that trees were just tipping over, and we had to get it done. That was one of the first moments where it was like, &quot;Wow. These guys don&apos;t mess around.&quot; <em>[Laughs]</em></p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".10aobnc2ups.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col
