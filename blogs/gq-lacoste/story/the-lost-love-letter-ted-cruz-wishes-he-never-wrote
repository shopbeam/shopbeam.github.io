  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFor a gentleman painter currently whiling away his days in a ritzy Dallas neighborhood, George W. Bush casts a long shadow over the Republican presidential field. Although he left the White House six years ago, and his approval ratings currently aren\u0027t as dismal as they used to be, the specter of his failed presidency is a cudgel Tea Party conservatives will wield against establishment Republicans in the GOP primaries, as well as Hillary Clinton\u0027s perhaps greatest piece of ammunition against her eventual GOP opponent. It would make sense for Dubya\u0027s shadow to loom largest over his brother, Jeb, who has taken great pains to show voters that he is his own man. (By telling them, for instance, \u0022I am my own man,\u0022 while Dubya himself has chimed in about Jeb, \u0022[H]e\u0027s totally different from me.\u0022) But there\u0027s another GOP presidential wannabe whose ties to Dubya, while not blood, are surprisingly close and thus could prove problematic: Ted Cruz.\u000A\u000AAt first glance, that would seem unlikely. Cruz, after all, is running to be the standard-bearer of the Tea Party—a political movement that, for all its fear and loathing of Barack Obama, actually traces its origins to its fear and loathing of George W. Bush and his handling of the financial crisis. Cheered along by these activists on the right wing since he arrived in Washington in 2013, Cruz has been waging war against the GOP establishment that both Bushes embody. And yet, before Cruz became a Texas Senator and the scourge of establishment Republicans, he worked on George W. Bush\u0027s 2000 presidential campaign (where he met his wife, Heidi); played an instrumental role (by his own account, at least) on the legal team that won Bush the Florida recount; and served two years in the Bush administration.\u000A\u000AThis isn\u0027t a scandal in and of itself. Bush was the last Republican president and a two-term one at that. It\u0027s a good bet that every candidate in the GOP field has some sort of incriminating connection to him, even if it\u0027s just a grip and grin picture. But the normally silver-tongued Cruz tends to tie himself into knots when trying to resolve the seeming contradiction between his previous work for Dubya and his current Tea Party poster-boy status. The latest example came earlier this month, in an interview with CNBC\u0027s John Harwood, who asked Cruz whether he supported Bush\u0027s expansion of Medicare to cover prescription drugs—something that Bush\u0027s critics on the right, no fans of big government programs, especially despise. Cruz replied:\u000A\u000AThat was a policy fight I was not engaged in at the time. I had other issues on my plate. I\u0027ll tell you what wasn\u0027t right. When George W. Bush entered office, the national debt was $5 trillion. When he left, it was $10 trillion. That wasn\u0027t right.And, now, Obama has taken that and made it much worse. He\u0027s taken it from $10 trillion to over $18 trillion. But I respect George W. Bush a great deal. I spent a number of years of my life working for him. I think he is an honorable man. I think he did what he believed was right. But I think domestically, his administration spent far too much money.\u000A\u000AWhen Harwood pressed Cruz on whether he thought Bush\u0027s Medicare expansion was \u0022a mistake,\u0022 the Texas Senator continued to hem and haw, eventually saying, \u0022George W. Bush did not campaign as a small government conservative… He campaigned under the banner of compassionate conservatism.\u0022\u000A\u000ANew York magazine\u0027s Jonathan Chait has noted the disingenuousness (and, at times, incoherence) of Cruz\u0027s Medicare dodge: even if Cruz wasn\u0027t \u0022engaged\u0022 in the fight at the time—which is a bit hard to believe, considering how big a fight it was—there\u0027s nothing preventing him from having an opinion about it now. Meanwhile, Jonathan Martin, of the New York Times  flagged the inherent awkwardness of Cruz explaining that Bush won as a \u0022compassionate conservative,\u0022 since the whole theory of Cruz\u0027s presidential bid is that Republicans only win the White House when they nominate bold conservatives (i.e. Ronald Reagan). But Cruz\u0027s current stance toward Bush is particularly disingenuous and awkward when you consider it in light of things he said back when Dubya was in the White House and Cruz wrote a fawning essay about the forty-third president.\u000A\u000AIn August 2004, just in time for the Republican National Convention, Cruz contributed to a long-forgotten but fascinating historical document—a book-length brief for Bush\u0027s reelection called Thank You, President Bush: Reflections on the War on Terror, Defense of the Family, and Revival of the Economy. Edited by Aman Verjee and Rod D. Martin, the book, which Martin says sold about 12,000 copies, featured a variety of conservative luminaries singing Bush\u0027s praises. \u0022It was an assessment at halftime,\u0022 Martin recently told me, \u0022and a belief that a second term would be a confirmation of the foundation laid during the first term.\u0022 As such, the book presented authors like Dick Cheney on the Bush Doctrine, John Ashcroft on the Patriot Act, Arthur Laffer on the Bush tax cuts, and so on.\u000A\u000AAnd then there was Ted Cruz, at the time the Solicitor General of Texas, who lauded Bush\u0027s \u0022opportunity conservatism,\u0022 which, as Cruz defined it, sounded a lot like the compassionate conservatism he now denigrates: \u0022a single-minded focus of easing the means of ascent for those on the bottom of the economic ladder.\u0022 It wasn\u0027t the only place where the Cruz of old sounded a bit unlike the one now running for president.\u000A\u000AToday, Cruz routinely disparages \u0022the mushy middle\u0022 and his presidential campaign is focused almost exclusively on turning out the GOP base, especially Tea Partiers and evangelicals. \u0022[R]oughly half of born again Christians aren\u0027t voting,\u0022 he lamented in his  campaign kickoff speech at Liberty University last month. \u0022Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values.\u0022 But a decade ago Cruz was singing a different tune, urging his fellow Republicans to expand their party\u0027s tent. \u0022Demographic changes and the rising tide of immigration necessitate Republicans learning how to articulate the message of opportunity,\u0022 Cruz wrote. \u0022Republicans must learn to better communicate to racial minorities, to express with sincerity and conviction the compassion and promise that their policies embody. That message, delivered from the heart, will in time reach those voters and will resonate with the many \u0027swing\u0027 voters in the middle.\u0022\u000A\u000AAlthough Cruz now criticizes Bush for spending too much money on domestic programs, in 2004 he pooh-poohed worries that Bush\u0027s opportunity conservatism flew in the face of a commitment to small government. \u0022[S]ome fiscal conservatives have criticized President Bush\u0027s because government spending has continued to grow over the past four years,\u0022 he wrote. \u0022But those concerns are often overstated.\u0022\u000A\u000AOther concerns about Bush that Cruz apparently thought were overstated in 2004? Bush\u0027s \u0022No Child Left Behind\u0022 education reform policy. \u0022Some critics have objected to the increased federal money going to education,\u0022 Cruz wrote, \u0022but the bill also requires testing of every child in third and eighth grades and requires schools to provide parents with detailed report cards of the school\u0027s performance. . . . The focus is on accountability and results.\u0022 Today, Cruz is a co-sponsor of legislation that would allow states to opt out of federal testing and accountability standards and, in railing against Common Core, has declared that the federal government \u0022has no business sticking its nose in education.\u0022 Cruz has also called for the elimination of the Department of Education. In Thank You, President Bush, however, Cruz wrote: \u0022As President Bush put it in the 2000 campaign, when voters hear \u0027Abolish the Department of Education,\u0027 a lot of voters just hear \u0027Abolish Education\u0027 and back away.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a similar tonal discrepancy between the Cruz of today and the Cruz of a decade ago when it comes to immigration. In Thank You, President Bush, Cruz hailed the president for describing immigrants as \u0022Americans by choice,\u0022 a term Bush prominently employed when he announced his proposal for a new temporary worker program that never became law after Bush\u0027s conservative critics decried it as amnesty. Today, Cruz is strategically ambiguous about whether he supports any sort of temporary legal status for undocumented immigrants, but he\u0027s as bombastically outspoken an opponent of immigration reform as anyone in the Senate.\u000A\u000AGranted, there are some areas where the Cruz of 2004 is in lockstep with the Cruz of today. In Thank You, President Bush, he praised Bush\u0027s support for Social Security privatization, which Cruz continues to champion. Similarly, the Cruz of 2004 and the Cruz of 2015 both want to cut tas and ease regulations on small businesses. But these, of course, are positions shared by every faction of the GOP. What\u0027s so striking about Cruz\u0027s views in Thank You, President Bush is that, wherever there\u0027s now discordance between the GOP establishment and Tea Partiers\u0027, there\u0027s also discordance between the Cruz of yore and the Cruz of today.\u000A\u000AWhich points to something important about the Texas Senator. Although he\u0027s viewed as an uncompromising ideologue, he\u0027s really an opportunist. That\u0027s not to say Cruz isn\u0027t conservative. He is and always has been. But his conservatism is malleable. Early in his career, he was an establishment conservative and cast his lot squarely with Bush. But after Cruz experienced his own flameout in Bush World—when he didn\u0027t get the plum assignment he was hoping for in D.C. and eventually went back to Texas—and certainly after Bush\u0027s presidency cratered, Cruz recast himself as a Tea Partier. When Cruz got to the Senate, it was assumed he\u0027d be a hybrid of sorts and serve as an ambassador from the establishment to the grassroots. But he quickly showed no interest in that sort of diplomacy and went all in with the Tea Party, completely shedding his establishmentarian past.\u000A\u000AAnd now, when confronted with that past, Cruz finds himself in an awkward position. When I interviewed Cruz in his Senate office in July 2013 and showed him a copy of the book (which I\u0027d bought for six cents on Amazon), he was momentarily taken aback. \u0022Now that\u0027s impressive that you tracked that down,\u0022 he said. \u0022You\u0027ve been doing a lot of work, I will give you that.\u0022 He went on, \u0022Needless to say, at the time, that was a collection of essays, and the chapter that I wrote\u0022—he paused for several seconds—\u0022I endeavored to lay out, as a significant part of this, my vision for the direction that conservative domestic policy should go.\u0022 He then launched into the oft-told tale about his father\u0027s remarkable rise from penniless immigrant to successful businessman. Last week when I raised the matter with Rick Tyler, a spokesman for Cruz\u0027s campaign, he disputed that there was much discord at all between the Cruz of today and the Cruz of Thank You, President Bush. Tyler argued that Cruz is \u0022not anti-immigration but anti-illegal-immigration\u0022 and that, at the time Cruz wrote his essay, the extent of the Bush administration\u0027s fiscal irresponsibility was not yet clear. \u0022In the context of 2004, there were a lot of unknowns,\u0022 Tyler said. \u0022You didn\u0027t have the retrospective you had in 2008 or now.\u0022\u000A\u000AOf course, Cruz does have one other surefire defense against the Scarlet W, at least when it comes to Thank You, President Bush. He can always point out that his chapter on Bush wasn\u0027t nearly as obsequious as some of the others, especially the book\u0027s introduction, which read in part: \u0022In the next four years, President Bush will build on the current economic growth and strengthen our recovery by making sure tax relief is permanent. In the next four years, President George W. Bush will continue to make America proud. I, for one, am looking forward to it.\u0022 The author of that particular bit of treacle? Jeb Bush.",

href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-george-w-bush-painting-interview-20141215-story.html">gentleman painter</a> currently whiling away his days in a <a href="http://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-home/2012/september-october/preston-hollow-dallas-presidential-suite">ritzy Dallas neighborhood</a>, George W. Bush casts a long shadow over the Republican presidential field. Although he left the White House six years ago, and his approval ratings currently aren&#x2019;t <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/poll-americans-now-kinda-okay-with-george-w-bush/">as dismal as they used to be</a>, the specter of his failed presidency is a cudgel Tea Party conservatives will wield against establishment Republicans in the GOP primaries, as well as Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s perhaps greatest piece of ammunition against her eventual GOP opponent. It would make sense for Dubya&#x2019;s shadow to loom largest over his brother, Jeb, who has taken great pains to show voters that he is his own man. (By telling them, for instance, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/18/politics/jeb-bush-iraq-speech/">&quot;I am my own man,&quot;</a> while Dubya himself has chimed in about Jeb, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/george-w-bush-jeb-bush-2016-117020.html?hp=r3_4">&quot;[H]e&#x2019;s totally different from me.&quot;</a>) But there&#x2019;s another GOP presidential wannabe whose ties to Dubya, while not blood, are surprisingly close and thus could prove problematic: Ted Cruz.</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.2">At first glance, that would seem unlikely. Cruz, after all, is running to be the standard-bearer of the Tea Party&#x2014;a political movement that, for all its fear and loathing of Barack Obama, actually traces its origins to its fear and loathing of George W. Bush and his handling of the financial crisis. Cheered along by these activists on the right wing since he arrived in Washington in 2013, Cruz has been <a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201310/ted-cruz-republican-senator-october-2013">waging war</a> against the GOP establishment that both Bushes embody. And yet, before Cruz became a Texas Senator and the scourge of establishment Republicans, he worked on George W. Bush&#x2019;s 2000 presidential campaign (where he met his wife, Heidi); played an instrumental role (by his <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/30/the-absolutist-2">own account</a>, at least) on the legal team that won Bush the Florida recount; and served two years in the Bush administration.</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.3">This isn&#x2019;t a scandal in and of itself. Bush was the last Republican president and a two-term one at that. It&#x2019;s a good bet that every candidate in the GOP field has some sort of incriminating connection to him, even if it&#x2019;s just a <a href="http://blog.libertyconservatives.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ben-carson-and-george-bush.jpg">grip and grin picture</a>. But the normally silver-tongued Cruz tends to tie himself into knots when trying to resolve the seeming contradiction between his previous work for Dubya and his current Tea Party poster-boy status. The latest example came earlier this month, in an <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102570583">interview with CNBC&#x2019;s John Harwood</a>, who asked Cruz whether he supported Bush&#x2019;s expansion of Medicare to cover prescription drugs&#x2014;something that Bush&#x2019;s critics on the right, no fans of big government programs, especially despise. Cruz replied:</p><div class="embed blockquote" data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.5"><blockquote><p>That was a policy fight I was not engaged in at the time. I had other issues on my plate. I&#x2019;ll tell you what wasn&#x2019;t right. When George W. Bush entered office, the national debt was $5 trillion. When he left, it was $10 trillion. That wasn&#x2019;t right.</p><p>And, now, Obama has taken that and made it much worse. He&#x2019;s taken it from $10 trillion to over $18 trillion. But I respect George W. Bush a great deal. I spent a number of years of my life working for him. I think he is an honorable man. I think he did what he believed was right. But I think domestically, his administration spent far too much money.</p></blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.6">When Harwood pressed Cruz on whether he thought Bush&#x2019;s Medicare expansion was &quot;a mistake,&quot; the Texas Senator continued to hem and haw, eventually saying, &quot;George W. Bush did not campaign as a small government conservative&#x2026; He campaigned under the banner of compassionate conservatism.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.7"><em>New York</em> magazine&#x2019;s Jonathan Chait <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/04/crazy-unpopular-ted-cruz-is-also-dishonest.html">has noted</a> the disingenuousness (and, at times, incoherence) of Cruz&#x2019;s Medicare dodge: even if Cruz wasn&#x2019;t &quot;engaged&quot; in the fight at the time&#x2014;which is a bit hard to believe, considering how <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/19/republican-budget-hypocrisy-health-care-opinions-columnists-bruce-bartlett.html">big a fight</a> it was&#x2014;there&#x2019;s nothing preventing him from having an opinion about it now. Meanwhile, Jonathan Martin, of the<em> New York Times</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/04/09/an-awkward-exception-to-cruzs-recipe-for-winning-the-white-house/"> flagged</a> the inherent awkwardness of Cruz explaining that Bush won as a &quot;compassionate conservative,&quot; since the whole theory of Cruz&#x2019;s presidential bid is that Republicans only win the White House when they nominate bold conservatives (i.e. Ronald Reagan). But Cruz&#x2019;s current stance toward Bush is particularly disingenuous and awkward when you consider it in light of things he said back when Dubya was in the White House and Cruz wrote a fawning essay about the forty-third president.</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.8">In August 2004, just in time for the Republican National Convention, Cruz contributed to a long-forgotten but fascinating historical document&#x2014;a book-length brief for Bush&#x2019;s reelection called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thank-You-President-Bush-Reflections/dp/0974670111"><em>Thank You, President Bush: Reflections on the War on Terror, Defense of the Family, and Revival of the Economy</em></a>. Edited by Aman Verjee and Rod D. Martin, the book, which Martin says sold about 12,000 copies, featured a variety of conservative luminaries singing Bush&#x2019;s praises. &quot;It was an assessment at halftime,&quot; Martin recently told me, &quot;and a belief that a second term would be a confirmation of the foundation laid during the first term.&quot; As such, the book presented authors like Dick Cheney on the Bush Doctrine, John Ashcroft on the Patriot Act, Arthur Laffer on the Bush tax cuts, and so on.</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.9">And then there was Ted Cruz, at the time the Solicitor General of Texas, who lauded Bush&#x2019;s &quot;opportunity conservatism,&quot; which, as Cruz defined it, sounded a lot like the compassionate conservatism he now denigrates: &quot;a single-minded focus of easing the means of ascent for those on the bottom of the economic ladder.&quot; It wasn&#x2019;t the only place where the Cruz of old sounded a bit unlike the one now running for president.</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.a">Today, Cruz routinely disparages <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/cruzs-strategy-destroy-the-mushy-middle-116326.html">&quot;the mushy middle&quot;</a> and his presidential campaign is focused almost exclusively on turning out the GOP base, especially Tea Partiers and evangelicals. &quot;[R]oughly half of born again Christians aren&#x2019;t voting,&quot; he lamented in his <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-ted-cruzs-speech-at-liberty-university/2015/03/23/41c4011a-d168-11e4-a62f-ee745911a4ff_story.html"> campaign kickoff speech</a> at Liberty University last month. &quot;Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values.&quot; But a decade ago Cruz was singing a different tune, urging his fellow Republicans to expand their party&#x2019;s tent. &quot;Demographic changes and the rising tide of immigration necessitate Republicans learning how to articulate the message of opportunity,&quot; Cruz wrote. &quot;Republicans must learn to better communicate to racial minorities, to express with sincerity and conviction the compassion and promise that their policies embody. That message, delivered from the heart, will in time reach those voters and will resonate with the many &#x2019;swing&#x2019; voters in the middle.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.b">Although Cruz now criticizes Bush for spending too much money on domestic programs, in 2004 he pooh-poohed worries that Bush&#x2019;s opportunity conservatism flew in the face of a commitment to small government. &quot;[S]ome fiscal conservatives have criticized President Bush&#x2019;s because government spending has continued to grow over the past four years,&quot; he wrote. &quot;But those concerns are often overstated.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.c">Other concerns about Bush that Cruz apparently thought were overstated in 2004? Bush&#x2019;s &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; education reform policy. &quot;Some critics have objected to the increased federal money going to education,&quot; Cruz wrote, &quot;but the bill also requires testing of every child in third and eighth grades and requires schools to provide parents with detailed report cards of the school&#x2019;s performance. . . . The focus is on accountability and results.&quot; Today, Cruz is a co-sponsor of <a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/campaign-k-12/2013/06/could_conservative_criticism_c.html">legislation that would allow</a> states to opt out of federal testing and accountability standards and, in railing against Common Core, <a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/577256218504245248">has declared</a> that the federal government &quot;has no business sticking its nose in education.&quot; Cruz <a href="http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2012/sep/27/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-ted-cruz-pledges-shut-down-depart/">has also called</a> for the elimination of the Department of Education. In <em>Thank You, President Bush</em>, however, Cruz wrote: &quot;As President Bush put it in the 2000 campaign, when voters hear &#x2019;Abolish the Department of Education,&#x2019; a lot of voters just hear &#x2019;Abolish Education&#x2019; and back away.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.d">There&#x2019;s a similar tonal discrepancy between the Cruz of today and the Cruz of a decade ago when it comes to immigration. In <em>Thank You, President Bush</em>, Cruz hailed the president for describing immigrants as &quot;Americans by choice,&quot; a term Bush prominently employed when he <a href="http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/01/20040107-3.html">announced</a> his proposal for a new temporary worker program that never became law after Bush&#x2019;s conservative critics <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-last-president-who-couldnt-get-congress-to-act-on-immigration/">decried it as amnesty</a>. Today, Cruz <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ted-cruz-hasnt-ruled-out-legal-status-undocumented-imigrants">is strategically ambiguous</a> about whether he supports any sort of temporary legal status for undocumented immigrants, but he&#x2019;s as <a href="http://immigrationimpact.com/2015/03/23/deciphering-the-immigration-policy-positions-of-ted-cruz/">bombastically outspoken an opponent</a> of immigration reform as anyone in the Senate.</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.e">Granted, there are some areas where the Cruz of 2004 is in lockstep with the Cruz of today. In <em>Thank You, President Bush</em>, he praised Bush&#x2019;s support for Social Security privatization, which Cruz continues to champion. Similarly, the Cruz of 2004 and the Cruz of 2015 both want to cut tas and ease regulations on small businesses. But these, of course, are positions shared by every faction of the GOP. What&#x2019;s so striking about Cruz&#x2019;s views in <em>Thank You, President Bush</em> is that, wherever there&#x2019;s now discordance between the GOP establishment and Tea Partiers&#x2019;, there&#x2019;s also discordance between the Cruz of yore and the Cruz of today.</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.f">Which points to something important about the Texas Senator. Although he&#x2019;s viewed as an uncompromising ideologue, he&#x2019;s really an opportunist. That&#x2019;s not to say Cruz isn&#x2019;t conservative. He is and always has been. But his conservatism is malleable. Early in his career, he was an establishment conservative and cast his lot squarely with Bush. But after Cruz experienced his own flameout in Bush World&#x2014;when he didn&#x2019;t get the plum assignment he was hoping for in D.C. and eventually went back to Texas&#x2014;and certainly after Bush&#x2019;s presidency cratered, Cruz recast himself as a Tea Partier. When Cruz got to the Senate, it was assumed he&#x2019;d be a hybrid of sorts and serve as <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/a-tricky-task-ted-cruz-as-nrsc-link-to-tea-party-84665.html">an ambassador</a> from the establishment to the grassroots. But he quickly showed no interest in that sort of diplomacy and went all in with the Tea Party, completely shedding his establishmentarian past.</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.g">And now, when confronted with that past, Cruz finds himself in an awkward position. When I interviewed Cruz in his Senate office in July 2013 and showed him a copy of the book (which I&#x2019;d bought for six cents on Amazon), he was momentarily taken aback. &quot;Now that&#x2019;s impressive that you tracked that down,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#x2019;ve been doing a lot of work, I will give you that.&quot; He went on, &quot;Needless to say, at the time, that was a collection of essays, and the chapter that I wrote&quot;&#x2014;he paused for several seconds&#x2014;&quot;I endeavored to lay out, as a significant part of this, my vision for the direction that conservative domestic policy should go.&quot; He then launched into the oft-told tale about his father&#x2019;s remarkable rise from penniless immigrant to successful businessman. Last week when I raised the matter with Rick Tyler, a spokesman for Cruz&#x2019;s campaign, he disputed that there was much discord at all between the Cruz of today and the Cruz of <em>Thank You, President Bush</em>. Tyler argued that Cruz is &quot;not anti-immigration but anti-illegal-immigration&quot; and that, at the time Cruz wrote his essay, the extent of the Bush administration&#x2019;s fiscal irresponsibility was not yet clear. &quot;In the context of 2004, there were a lot of unknowns,&quot; Tyler said. &quot;You didn&#x2019;t have the retrospective you had in 2008 or now.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.4.h">Of course, Cruz does have one other surefire defense against the Scarlet W, at least when it comes to <em>Thank You, President Bush</em>. He can always point out that his chapter on Bush wasn&#x2019;t nearly as obsequious as some of the others, especially the book&#x2019;s introduction, which read in part: &quot;In the next four years, President Bush will build on the current economic growth and strengthen our recovery by making sure tax relief is permanent. In the next four years, President George W. Bush will continue to make America proud. I, for one, am looking forward to it.&quot; The author of that particular bit of treacle? Jeb Bush.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15" data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.5.0.0"><div class="component-topics" data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0"><ul data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0"><li data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-0"><a href="http://www.gq.com/search?tags=GEORGE&#32;W.&#32;BUSH" data-reactid=".7hxp71mku8.1.1.0.0.5.0.0.0.0.$topic-item-0.0">GEORGE W.
