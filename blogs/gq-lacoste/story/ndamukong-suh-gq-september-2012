  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Backstage at Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, all the greenroom doors swing wildly, guests popping out—a beaming Kyra Sedgwick, honeysuckle-sweet; a burly reality-TV star hugging, loving—everyone here is buzzed, juiced as if on a sugarcoated planet.\u000A\u000A Everyone except Ndamukong Suh. He\u0027s behind the middle door. Shut. Off-limits. There\u0027s a guy in a suit knocking, coaxing, holding a Subway sandwich. Come on out and join the party! Knocking again. Nothing. I\u0027m standing with the suited man thinking, Well, good luck, buddy. Because this is how it\u0027s been all day with Suh. All day long I\u0027ve been waiting. Ducking in and out of cars with him, shifting one hip, then the other, standing, just trying to make eye contact with him, having long given up on a smile, let alone words. Nothing. Shy? Rude? Mean? I have no idea.\u000A\u000A On the football field, Suh is fire, heat, a constant explosion of violent desire. He is science fiction; six feet four, 307 pounds, a speeding machine of humanity intent on devouring mankind, per the NFL-defensive-lineman mystique. Suh was second overall in the 2010 draft; signed with Detroit for $68 million; became immediately famous for demolishing quarterbacks; had ten sacks, more than any Lion, any rookie, any defensive tackle in the league his first year. His style is unmistakably violent, doing whatever it takes to get the job done and then some—seemingly shoving a forearm into Jay Cutler\u0027s head during a tackle, throwing Marion Barber down by his hair. Midway through his second season, he was voted the NFL\u0027s \u0022dirtiest player\u0022 by fellow players.\u000A\u000A And that was all before The Stomping. Thanksgiving Day 2011, third quarter, Packers 7, Lions 0, and Suh some kind of snorting bull out there, full of rage or testosterone or whatever else overcomes and compels a man. The whistle blew, pass in the end zone incomplete, but there back at the line of scrimmage was the drama, there was Packers lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith\u0027s head getting pounded by Suh into the turf; Suh bounces up and here comes his foot, his cleat, bam! onto Dietrich-Smith\u0027s arm. Constant replays on TV and everlasting replays online tell a simple story of raw temper, a burst of hot, spoiled-brat rage—exploding out of a gigantic multimillionaire in spandex.\u000A\u000A Ejected from the game, suspended for two more, and docked those game checks—adding to the $47,500 already levied by the NFL—Ndamukong Suh has been flagged for more personal fouls than any other player since 2010. He\u0027s become a symbol for violence in sports, of crossing the line from fair to foul play. All those headlines about concussions. Young guys bashing their heads so hard they turn into middle-aged crazy guys. Suicidal. Terrible shit. With all those headlines, America has been ripe for an icon to push against, a guy who might stand for a reason to no longer tolerate spectacular sadistic hits—and for the moment Suh is it.\u000A\u000A He finally has to emerge from his dressing room, because it\u0027s almost his turn to go on TV, and the Subway guy hands him the sandwich he has been paid to endorse. Cameras click, sputter, and twinkle. The Subway guys—they have multiplied—are all goofy smiles, and one of them is saying, Please, please try to get the word \u0022Subway\u0022 somehow in there with Fallon, maybe he can slip it in, and Suh is nodding his big oblong head, standing over them like a sycamore in a creek full of scrawny cattails, and then one of the Subway guys whips out a photo of the bust they made of Suh, more than 1,000 pepperoni slices forming ears, nose, chin, countless black olive curls, provolone eyeballs, freshly baked bready shoulders. Would Suh sign a picture of the remarkable pepperoni likeness of his head? \u0022Uh, sure,\u0022 he says, blinking studiously at the photo of his meat face, and this is when I feel something resembling compassion begin to grow inside me.\u000A\u000A On Fallon he throws some kind of switch and turns charming. \u0022I\u0027m soft-spoken,\u0022 he tells Jimmy, offering eyes of understanding and intellect. \u0022Where I am today isn\u0027t just because of my hard work and family and friends but from the village of people that have been around me and always taken care of me.\u0022 Fallon lobs him easy ones, mentions the $2.6 million Suh donated to his alma mater, the University of Nebraska, the largest philanthropic gift ever from a former player. Suh smoothly shrugs it off, expert as a politician in his response until he turns it into a friggin\u0027 Subway plug, of all beautiful things, even though the donation had nothing whatsoever to do with Subway, and the Subway guys are back here high-fiving Russ, Suh\u0027s marketing agent, who told them so, because Ndamukong is good, is loyal, is always obedient.\u000A\u000A I\u0027m trying to square these: dutiful performer, dirty player, mute monster. He is a tangle of contradiction, or he is a man of deliberate calculation and design. After the show we ride the elevator in silence, except when he offers me the hoagie to take home.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Ndamukong (en-da-meh-kon) means \u0022house of spears\u0022 in the language of the Ngemba tribe of Cameroon, the small country in Africa where his dad grew up. His mom is from Jamaica. His sister, Ngum—\u0022giver of strength, giver of power\u0022—came first, and four years later, Ndamukong, named after his great-grandfather who famously stood seven feet three. They were different from other kids in middle-class Portland, Oregon. Their parents, who divorced when the kids were still preschoolers, were strict rulers, demanding way more respect than other parents. Family tradition dictated that the older sibling make something of herself and then turn her attention to the younger, for whom she is responsible. At 29, Ngum is Suh\u0027s manager, scheduler, gatekeeper. He does nothing without consulting Ngum. No one gets to him without going through Ngum, who calls herself \u0022my brother\u0027s keeper.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Everything off the field, I got it; that\u0027s the motto,\u0022 she\u0027s saying. \u0022I didn\u0027t really have a choice. It\u0027s a family business, and this is my job.\u0022 We\u0027re driving toward their dad\u0027s house in Portland, and she\u0027s showing me around the neighborhood, split-levels, small yards occasionally separated by chain-link dog fences, clematis vines, and short driveways with lying-down bikes. I make the point to Ngum that getting to know her brother is like trying to catch a cat.\u000A\u000A \u0022It can be taken as rude,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000A \u0022Yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022But it\u0027s not—\u0022\u000A\u000A She\u0027s wearing a haphazard braid down her back, a chiseled face, model-beautiful. \u0022He grew up quiet,\u0022 she says. \u0022He would not talk. You almost wanted to start worrying. In middle school, I was like, \u0027What\u0027s wrong with you?\u0027 He just studies every situation before speaking. He was always that way. And then it turned out he had a photographic memory. His style of learning is just...sick.\u0022\u000A\u000A The house is simple, low, with green siding and a concrete stoop, and there\u0027s a blue van out front advertising Suh Son Mechanical LLC, their dad\u0027s heating-and-air-conditioning business. Suh\u0027s black BMW 750Li is parked next to it, the only sign that anything spectacular may be going on here at all. The garage door rises when she pushes the button, and she asks me not to mind the mess. \u0022He\u0027s probably in his room,\u0022 Ngum says. \u0022Our rooms are across from each other. Our parents are like, culturally, there\u0027s no reason to move out unless you\u0027re married, you know?\u0022\u000A\u000A I mumble something polite about how a lot of people move home after college, so this is nothing...odd?\u000A\u000A Do I need to point out that her brother will earn $68 million—and that\u0027s before his endorsements with Nike, Chrysler, and all the rest? Do I need to point out that her brother is fourteenth on the Forbes list of the world\u0027s hundred highest-paid athletes?\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A _The Suhs (from left): sister Ngum, father Michael, and\u000A\u000A shy, quiet Ndamukong, whose name means \u0022house of\u000A\u000A spears.\u0022_\u000A\u000A The world\u0027s. \u000A\u000A Suh recently bought a house outside Detroit, where he and Ngum live during the season, and they have a place in Houston, but Portland is home during the off-season. It\u0027s comfortable. It\u0027s got that nice, big training facility at the Nike headquarters nearby. It\u0027s home, and returning to it is a sign of respect. Just like, she says, not drinking in front of your parents is a sign of respect. And not cursing in front of your parents. \u0022I think he curses on the football field,\u0022 Ngum says, holding her lips tight. \u0022I can see it.\u0022 One time he called her and told her he got a tattoo. \u0022I was getting ready to throw up,\u0022 she says. \u0022I\u0027m like, \u0027How am I going to hide that from Mom and Dad? They are going to see it!\u0027 I was almost in tears. And then he\u0027s like, \u0027Just kidding.\u0027 I was going to kill him. That was not a funny joke at all.\u0022\u000A\u000A I make the point that he\u0027s a 25-year-old filthy-rich feared monster athlete who can bench-press 475 pounds. He can\u0027t get a tattoo?\u000A\u000A \u0022Oh, my gosh, no!\u0022\u000A\u000A Ngum makes Ndamukong come out of his room and eat lunch with us, and at the restaurant he stays buried in his BlackBerry, then his iPhone, then his BlackBerry again, but after he finishes a heaping mound of pad thai, she looks at him and says, \u0022Well?\u0022 and makes him talk to me about his approach, each week, as he prepares to crush quarterbacks.\u000A\u000A \u0022Mondays I sleep,\u0022 he offers. He\u0027s dressed in black workout gear, and he takes up so much space at the table everything around him looks miniature. \u0022I go in at ten, do my lift, watch the game from the day before. Tuesday is off, but I go in, lift, watch film. Then I have French toast with my sister.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022We love French toast,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000A \u0022French toast Tuesdays,\u0022 he says. \u0022Then I study. I understand the whole plan by Thursday. Friday I memorize it. Then I cut my brain off from football. That\u0027s how I treat it: Don\u0027t let your brain get overheated. Saturday night I eat by myself, go over it, like final exams. Take a picture of it with my brain, like. It gets imprinted on my brain. Then, when that week is over, I slash it out and start putting the new stuff in.\u0022\u000A\u000A He pauses, looks at her, shrugs.\u000A\u000A \u0022That\u0027s basically it during the season,\u0022 she says. \u0022That\u0027s about it.\u0022\u000A\u000A He says he has to go. She invites me to come to the house later for dinner to talk more. But he blows off dinner, disappears, and she can\u0027t find him, so she checks her Twitter feed, because that\u0027s the easiest way; some fan just spotted Ndamukong Suh at Costco looking at TVs.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The stomping. Every time I bring it up, people here seem vaguely startled. Why are we talking about this again? \u000A\u000A \u0022This is sports,\u0022 says his dad, Michael. \u0022Sometimes you go out there and you\u0027re going to stomp on somebody.\u0022 He himself is a soccer man, a star back home in his village. That\u0027s what his kids were supposed to play. \u0022I\u0027m behind in American football,\u0022 he allows. \u0022Even now, I\u0027m not all the way up on it.\u0022 He\u0027s a slight, tidy man—only five eight—with a round face encircled with unapologetic fuzz. He\u0027s sitting at a desk in his basement, where he just finished a bid for a job installing a furnace.\u000A\u000A Ndamukong started out playing soccer, like his sister before him. She excelled at it, played for Mississippi State, made the Cameroon national team. He was different, clearly an athlete but so damn big, an oaf out there rumbling down the pitch, knocking kids over, helping them up, lifting them with one hand by the shorts. Like the Jolly Green Giant on the TV commercials. He was good at basketball, too, but it was always hold back, hold back, his body pushing him to go bigger, wider, broader, the world telling him: No. You\u0027ll hurt somebody. He tried shot put, threw sixty-one feet, four inches, state champion. So that was easy. But football—now, football looked interesting. His dad said no way. Football was scary. His mom said no way. Football was violent, and don\u0027t forget academics comes first. \u0022Then one day he came home and said, \u0027You gonna come watch my game?\u0027 \u0022 his dad recalls. \u0022I said, \u0027What game?\u0027 He said, \u0027Football.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A Coaches had been begging him to play. A kid that big? That nimble? His first year trying, a sophomore, he played varsity. A prodigy. He had always been \u0022a fine-tuned kid,\u0022 teachers said; he could be a surgeon the way he focused, the way he would lock into any task you gave him, and when football came along he locked all of himself in there. Physically the game was a liberation. Suddenly his size, his muscle mass, were assets. It was like coming out of the closet. He was encouraged to hit people. \u0022It\u0027s okay, Dad,\u0022 he said. \u0022The position I\u0027m playing, they\u0027re scared of me. I don\u0027t get hit. I hit them.\u0022 He said, \u0022It\u0027s okay, Mom. Come see.\u0022 He had maintained a 3.0, as she\u0027d demanded, and he\u0027d all but solved the issue about getting hurt, so there was nothing his parents could do.\u000A\u000A In a blink he was at Nebraska, cementing his name in the record books, then Detroit, where Lions coaches saw in Suh what Husker coaches had so readily seen. \u0022Cerebral,\u0022 former Nebraska defensive coordinator Carl Pelini used to say. \u0022Hungry.\u0022 One of the strongest guys he\u0027d ever seen play the game, coupled with the focus and discipline of a nerd. Suh used to meet with Pelini separately, weekly, talk about every defensive position on the field, study the possibilities and combinations like a chess player, turning plays over and inside out and over in his mind. His rookie year in Detroit, he was the same. On the field, on the line, it was the same. \u0022Suh plays super intense and super emotional,\u0022 says Packers offensive lineman Josh Sitton, who knows what it\u0027s like to breathe his steam. \u0022He definitely plays violently. And with a few things he\u0027s done, that line becomes very thin between playing violent and playing nasty.\u0022\u000A\u000A Suh\u0027s dad was at Ford Field on that Thanksgiving Day when his son got ejected for stomping Evan Dietrich-Smith (who would go on to hate having his career defined by two seconds of airtime—the guy who got stomped). \u0022I saw it,\u0022 Suh\u0027s dad recalls. \u0022I thought, it\u0027s part of the game. A lot of violent things happen. Referees always read the reaction. They do not see the action that started it.\u0022 Context, he says. Everything in context. \u0022It did not look like a stomp to me, it looked like somebody grabbing you and you trying to shake him off.\u0022 Bam! The foot. Dietrich-Smith\u0027s arm. Slow it down. Look at it again. Slow it down. That\u0027s what happened, Suh\u0027s dad says. Anybody looks at anything long enough, they\u0027ll see what they want to see. They wanted a villain, and they picked his son.\u000A\u000A The stomping was not something anyone in the family recognized as Suh\u0027s fault. At most, an accident. So it was not, \u0022Oh, we have to rein in that wild child.\u0022 Or, \u0022tame that evil demon.\u0022 He was never a wild child, had no more demons than the next guy. To them the stomping was simply bad luck. Just three games on TV that day, not much else for people to talk about. A bit of bad PR for the Suh brand. You mean people aren\u0027t over that yet? \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A __\u000A\u000A \u0022You want to come out to the driveway and see my van?\u0022 his dad asks. Suh Son LLC. He put \u0022 Son\u0022 on the van when Ndamukong graduated from college, because that was always the plan. \u0022He got his degree in construction management,\u0022 he points out. A family business, another option for Ndamukong to go into someday, his dad thinks.\u000A\u000A Suh\u0027s mother, across town, is no different. The bubble. The sister, the father, the mother, everyone in this family seems to be in some bubble distinctly removed from the American culture of celebrity, a situation that is not necessarily terribly odd, except they have an American celebrity in it. I\u0027m not yet convinced Ndamukong is complicit in creating the kind of fame he\u0027s selling, feeding an audience hungry for violence week after week.\u000A\u000A \u0022On the TV they\u0027re saying my son is angry,\u0022 Suh\u0027s mom says. She\u0027s lanky, somewhat nervous, a schoolteacher for thirty-two years who still walks down the block to the classroom each morning from her small clapboard house. \u0022They\u0027re building it up that he\u0027s an angry man,\u0022 she says. \u0022What does this child have to be angry about? This child is blessed. He has nothing to be angry about. So I don\u0027t know where they\u0027re getting that.\u0022\u000A\u000A She talks to me from her doorway. \u0022You know, I came to the conclusion last year, after he got that suspension, that maybe he just doesn\u0027t need to give 200 percent when he plays football,\u0022 she says. \u0022Do you know it\u0027s being perceived as a bad thing?\u0022\u000A\u000A I tell her yes, I know that.\u000A\u000A \u0022You want to see his room?\u0022 she asks, leading me through the bright blue dining room she painted well before her son started wearing Lion blue. His bedroom—tiny, jammed with football stuff—is not a shrine so much as something to show the neighborhood kids who come knocking. \u0022I need to update it. I\u0027ve got way more Nebraska stuff than Detroit. Popcorn bowls with his name on them, a Lions tail, ticket stubs, a Lions toothbrush, look at this, just stuff. Stuff, you know? I lead the kids back, and then at the end I show them...it.\u0022\u000A\u000A It? Apparently, there\u0027s a logic to the collection, a purpose.\u000A\u000A She walks up to his black Husker graduation gown hanging on the closet door, reaches to straighten a fold at the top. \u0022I just leave it hanging right here, kind of like the grand finale.\u0022\u000A\u000A I tell her frankly that I don\u0027t think the neighborhood kids are coming by to see Ndamukong Suh\u0027s graduation gown.\u000A\u000A \u0022I don\u0027t know what he did with the cap,\u0022 she says. \u0022I wanted that, too, but I\u0027m just kind of satisfied with the gown.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Nothing happens that makes Suh decide to talk to me, nothing particular or funny or unusual, but when he decides to talk, he comes on like a truck.\u000A\u000A We\u0027re in the training facility of the Nike headquarters, a sprawling campus of flowering ornamental trees lined up just so in front of rows of towering evergreens. Hushed, like a holy place, where fog settles between office buildings connected by garden pathways. Inside, the training building is all blond wood and black, vast, vaulted ceilings, photos of sweating determined faces blown up huge and towering over us like stained-glass windows in a cathedral. Sports may be the last institution of deference left in America—the body, the will, the fight—here\u0027s what irony and cynicism cannot yet touch.\u000A\u000A Trainers love Suh because he does what he\u0027s told. It\u0027s refreshing. Like when a teacher gets a kid who does all his homework without once whining. \u0022It\u0027s easy with Suh, because he buys into it,\u0022 says trainer Keith D\u0027Amelio. \u0022He sees the big picture. Athletes in general don\u0027t really understand why they\u0027re training. Just going in throwing weights isn\u0027t gonna do it.\u0022 He tells me about Suh\u0027s assessment plan, everything monitored, every movement, even his sleep—how much REM? Can we improve it? They work on range of motion, patterns of motion, muscle combinations. \u0022Suh\u0027s going to be a monster no matter what I do; he\u0027s as strong and powerful as they come. So what we do here is: Use it. Enhance it.\u0022\u000A\u000A When I got here this morning, Suh was on the ground pouring with sweat, doing push-ups with chains draped over his back and neck, chains as thick as my arm, doing what he\u0027s told, all obedience—to his trainers, to his coaches, to the NFL, to America. We did, after all, ask for this. The biggest kid, the toughest kid, the kid who doesn\u0027t hold back, uses his gifts, develops them, fine-tunes them, becomes the machine. He\u0027s a masterpiece of our creation. And now, if he\u0027s run amok, well, shame on...him? For America to take any responsibility is to take the fun out of football, so forget that. Forget all the chatter about concussions. We\u0027re not supposed to think about any of that stuff when it comes to our most successful sports league ever. We\u0027re supposed to buy into the new narrative that the NFL cares. Crack down on hits. Fine players who can\u0027t stop their bodies at eighteen miles an hour in the split second before impact. It\u0027s a truce. We know it\u0027s pretense; they bank on our willingness to deny our own hypocrisy.\u000A\u000A I was thinking about this stuff when Ngum called, asked me if Suh had talked to me yet, and I said no. Then Suh finished the workout and walked up to grab a towel, came so close to me I could feel the heat off him, and I smiled as anyone would smile to begin a conversation, but he took a towel and without once looking at me passed by and headed to the locker room. A few minutes later I got a call from Ngum saying he\u0027d meet me in the cafeteria. He was going to talk. She told me he was definitely going to talk.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A He has eggs. He\u0027s sitting across from me, and the cafeteria is closed, no one else here at all except the people in the kitchen who were kind enough to cook the eggs. \u0022A lot of people don\u0027t know truly who I am,\u0022 he tells me. \u0022And at this point in time, there are not a lot of people I let close enough to find out.\u0022\u000A\u000A I tell him I noticed. I decide it\u0027s not my place to tell him his evasiveness is extreme to the point of creepy.\u000A\u000A \u0022I don\u0027t want anybody in my circle that\u0027s a cancer to what I\u0027m trying to create,\u0022 he says. \u0022So stay on the outside and make your opinions. They\u0027re going to be meaningless to everything in the circle. The boundaries are up for me to keep, and a responsibility of my family, too. That\u0027s why, like, I guess you\u0027ve gone through a good screening process.\u0022\u000A\u000A Apparently, there\u0027s a compliment in here somewhere. (Cancer?) I ask him about being named the dirtiest player in the NFL.\u000A\u000A \u0022It\u0027s not the norm, I guess, to see someone as aggressive as me being more or less very athletic. You see me running, having a big, violent hit, it\u0027s going to look bad, but that\u0027s the natural ability I\u0027ve been given. Why would I let it run to the wayside and not use it?\u000A\u000A \u0022Football is a violent sport. Somebody\u0027s going to get hurt. It\u0027s the game. Just hopefully, you\u0027re on the good side of it. So I don\u0027t, I really don\u0027t get the controversy. It\u0027s the game.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022You play it dirty,\u0022 I say. \u0022Dirty is wrong.\u0022\u000A\u000A He says no. Emphatically no. He\u0027s not dirty. \u0022A dirty player is somebody who ultimately is trying to hurt somebody. There\u0027s a huge difference. There\u0027s no gray in that. Like, you have no conscience, no nothing, no guilt. I don\u0027t have that mean streak in me. I don\u0027t play angry. It\u0027s not anger.\u0022\u000A\u000A He\u0027s not, notably, jabbing his food like an angry person. In fact, his movements are gentle; his eyes scan the room as he thinks.\u000A\u000A \u0022When I first started playing, I was surprised at the fact that I was allowed to hit people as hard as I could and not get in trouble. Because in soccer, when you get to a certain level, you can slide-tackle and take them off their feet, but you have to always hit the ball first and then take that person out. But in football, that\u0027s not true. You can run as hard as you can into somebody else and take them down. Thumbs up!\u000A\u000A \u0022But as far as I know, I\u0027ve never hurt anybody through playing the game of football.\u0022\u000A\u000A I ask him about concussions, all the headlines now about guys like Junior Seau killing themselves, likely as a result of what football did to their brains.\u000A\u000A \u0022I think concussions are really important, but I don\u0027t think if you look back at any of my hits, there\u0027s nothing in the hit that would cause concussions. Maybe whiplash. That\u0027s not because of me, that\u0027s because somebody doesn\u0027t know how to take a hit. I\u0027m not doing helmet-to-helmet hits. I might hit somebody under their chin because I hit them in their chest and I rise up, because that\u0027s how we were taught to play football. Hit them and run your feet through. Eventually you\u0027re going to come up through the person. Concussions, I don\u0027t think, really fall into my category.\u0022\u000A\u000A It\u0027s odd to me that the guy with the rap as the dirtiest player in the NFL isn\u0027t more up on this stuff. I thought the NFL was on a campaign to explain brain injuries to its players, to warn them. It\u0027s not just about concussions. It\u0027s the subconcussive hits, the constant bam, bam, bam that linemen like Suh give and receive. Those are the hits scientists say cause the lasting damage to the brain, the kind of injuries that made guys like Mike Webster, Terry Long, and so many others go crazy. The subconcussive hits—every single play.\u000A\u000A \u0022Go hard every single play,\u0022 Suh says. \u0022That\u0027s how I\u0027ve been taught. So now, when they see that and that correlates to big plays, things that aren\u0027t in the norm, for them to justify it, they can\u0027t just say, Oh, it\u0027s a different person, it\u0027s a different breed of player, so they say, Oh, he\u0027s just dirty. That\u0027s their easy scapegoat.\u000A\u000A \u0022It\u0027s like, I open the throttle too much? I get in trouble for opening my throttle...just like being on a jet. Like, you know, when they\u0027re starting a plane, you just gradually, gradually throw it into full throttle. I\u0027m always in full throttle. But they tell me now I need to be at three-quarters of a throttle.\u000A\u000A \u0022The NFL, I don\u0027t know what their role is. I guess they have to punish. But at the same time, when I see the big Jay Cutler hit that I had in my rookie season, I supposedly hit him in the back of his head. I hit him in his nameplate. I got a fine for that, but yet you see on the NFL network or NFL.com it\u0027s publicized, it gets played millions and millions of times. So it\u0027s like a good thing, but it\u0027s a bad thing.\u000A\u000A \u0022I don\u0027t want to snap anybody\u0027s neck off. I was brought up to treat others like you want to be treated.\u0022\u000A\u000A And yet he stomps on a guy—after the whistle is blown.\u000A\u000A \u0022If you slow down and analyze anything, it\u0027s going to look worse in my opinion. It was not intentional. If it was intentional, it could have been a lot worse.\u000A\u000A \u0022If I wanted to go out there to hurt somebody, I could hurt somebody. I don\u0027t want any part of that.\u0022 Hurting is too easy. Too obvious. A yawn, in that regard. Beating someone is different from hurting someone. Beating someone, he says, that\u0027s the game.\u000A\u000A \u0022I mean, if I wanted to hurt you, I\u0027d go for your quarterback. Because me stopping your play is going to frustrate you more than me physically hurting you. Because I\u0027m just that much better than you. That\u0027s how I look at it. It\u0027s like killing somebody with kindness.\u0022\u000A\u000A Kindness. I promise him that kindness is not the word I expected to be considering when talking to Ndamukong Suh. I tell him I\u0027m not getting kindness. He says irritating might be a better word. He knows he\u0027s irritating. He\u0027s proud of that.\u000A\u000A \u0022It\u0027s mind games. A lot of mind games,\u0022 he says. He describes a play, like so many plays: trapped by two linemen, dodging one, throwing the other off, reaching the quarterback with all he had. \u0022All you hear is the wind being taken out of him, and he\u0027s, like, Oh sh—. I get enjoyment out of that. I like big hits because I impose my will.\u000A\u000A \u0022Getting an interception or a fumble or a recovery or a touchdown, that\u0027s out of this world, that\u0027s an amazing feeling,\u0022 he continues. \u0022But to be honest with you, it\u0027s more rewarding for me to get a sack. There\u0027s luck that goes into creating an interception, scoring a touchdown, but there\u0027s no luck in a sack.\u000A\u000A \u0022I love hitting Aaron Rodgers, Jay Cutler. Ben Roethlisberger, I would like to go against him, because they say he\u0027s one of the hardest to take down. I see that as a challenge, so I would love to take him down multiple times. Peyton Manning, oh, I would love that. I think Michael Vick, I did sack him, one of the most elusive quarterbacks to ever play the game. I took him down with one arm.\u0022\u000A\u000A He goes on. The guy who would not speak now can\u0027t be interrupted, talking hits, hits, the joy of hits.\u000A\u000A The stomping, he says one last time, was not intentional. He knows it. His family knows it. He is going to protect that mythology no matter what. He will ignore the people who say otherwise. He will stay inside the bubble and refuse to let any of that cancer in.\u000A\u000A \u0022For me personally? It\u0027s over,\u0022 he says. \u0022That\u0027s something that happened in the 2011 season. Will it follow me? I think it will follow me because of the outside world. It won\u0027t follow me because of me.\u0022\u000A\u000A It occurs to me that whatever role American celebrity has assigned him, and no matter how complicit he is in that transaction, he remains a 25-year-old young man who grew up painfully shy and obedient, and he isn\u0027t all that different today, except now we\u0027ve turned him into a pepperoni head.\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m quiet,\u0022 he says. \u0022I\u0027m very quiet. I\u0027m a very good observer. That\u0027s just the way I am. If I\u0027m speaking, it\u0027s because it\u0027s meaningful.\u0022",

season, Ndamukong Suh became the most vilified man in football, the poster boy for gratuitous violence and dirty play. But Suh&#39;s not just a 300-pound destruction machine. He knows what you think of him. He understands the game and his role in it. And he&#39;s happy to explain things, really, just give him a minute—but try not to mention The Stomping</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.0"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558319ec09f0bee564411eb4/master/w_806/sports-2012-09-suh-suh-628.jpg" alt="sports-2012-09-suh-suh-628.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;t=sports-2012-09-suh-suh-628.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;t=sports-2012-09-suh-suh-628.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558319ec09f0bee564411eb4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fsports-2012-09-suh-suh-628.jpg&amp;description=sports-2012-09-suh-suh-628.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558319ec09f0bee564411eb4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fsports-2012-09-suh-suh-628.jpg&amp;description=sports-2012-09-suh-suh-628.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1"> Backstage at <em>Late Night with Jimmy Fallon</em>, all the greenroom doors swing wildly, guests popping out&#x2014;a beaming Kyra Sedgwick, honeysuckle-sweet; a burly reality-TV star hugging, loving&#x2014;everyone here is buzzed, juiced as if on a sugarcoated planet.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2"> Everyone except Ndamukong Suh. He&apos;s behind the middle door. Shut. Off-limits. There&apos;s a guy in a suit knocking, coaxing, holding a Subway sandwich. <em>Come on out and join the party!</em> Knocking again. Nothing. I&apos;m standing with the suited man thinking, Well, good luck, buddy. Because this is how it&apos;s been all day with Suh. All day long I&apos;ve been waiting. Ducking in and out of cars with him, shifting one hip, then the other, standing, just trying to make eye contact with him, having long given up on a smile, let alone <em>words</em>. Nothing. Shy? Rude? Mean? I have no idea.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.3"> On the football field, Suh is fire, heat, a constant explosion of violent desire. He is science fiction; six feet four, 307 pounds, a speeding machine of humanity intent on devouring mankind, per the NFL-defensive-lineman mystique. Suh was second overall in the 2010 draft; signed with Detroit for $68 million; became immediately famous for <em>demolishing</em> quarterbacks; had ten sacks, more than any Lion, any rookie, any defensive tackle in the league his first year. His style is unmistakably violent, doing whatever it takes to get the job done and then some&#x2014;seemingly shoving a forearm into Jay Cutler&apos;s head during a tackle, throwing Marion Barber down by his hair. Midway through his second season, he was voted the NFL&apos;s &quot;dirtiest player&quot; by fellow players.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.5"> And that was all before The Stomping. Thanksgiving Day 2011, third quarter, Packers 7, Lions 0, and Suh some kind of snorting bull out there, full of rage or testosterone or whatever else overcomes and compels a man. The whistle blew, pass in the end zone incomplete, but there back at the line of scrimmage was the drama, there was Packers lineman Evan Dietrich-Smith&apos;s head getting pounded by Suh into the turf; Suh bounces up and here comes his foot, his cleat, <em>bam!</em> onto Dietrich-Smith&apos;s arm. Constant replays on TV and everlasting replays online tell a simple story of raw temper, a burst of hot, spoiled-brat rage&#x2014;exploding out of a gigantic multimillionaire in spandex.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.6"> Ejected from the game, suspended for two more, and docked those game checks&#x2014;adding to the $47,500 already levied by the NFL&#x2014;Ndamukong Suh has been flagged for more personal fouls than any other player since 2010. He&apos;s become a symbol for violence in sports, of crossing the line from fair to foul play. All those headlines about concussions. Young guys bashing their heads so hard they turn into middle-aged crazy guys. Suicidal. Terrible shit. With all those headlines, America has been ripe for an icon to push against, a guy who might stand for a reason to no longer tolerate spectacular sadistic hits&#x2014;and for the moment Suh is it.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.7"> He finally has to emerge from his dressing room, because it&apos;s almost his turn to go on TV, and the Subway guy hands him the sandwich he has been paid to endorse. Cameras click, sputter, and twinkle. The Subway guys&#x2014;they have multiplied&#x2014;are all goofy smiles, and one of them is saying, <em>Please, please try to get the word &quot;Subway&quot; somehow in there with Fallon, maybe he can slip it in</em>, and Suh is nodding his big oblong head, standing over them like a sycamore in a creek full of scrawny cattails, and then one of the Subway guys whips out a photo of the bust they made of Suh, more than 1,000 pepperoni slices forming ears, nose, chin, countless black olive curls, provolone eyeballs, freshly baked bready shoulders. Would Suh sign a picture of the remarkable pepperoni likeness of his head? &quot;Uh, sure,&quot; he says, blinking studiously at the photo of his meat face, and this is when I feel something resembling compassion begin to grow inside me.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.8"> On <em>Fallon</em> he throws some kind of switch and turns charming. &quot;I&apos;m soft-spoken,&quot; he tells Jimmy, offering eyes of understanding and intellect. &quot;Where I am today isn&apos;t just because of my hard work and family and friends but from the village of people that have been around me and always taken care of me.&quot; Fallon lobs him easy ones, mentions the $2.6 million Suh donated to his alma mater, the University of Nebraska, the largest philanthropic gift ever from a former player. Suh smoothly shrugs it off, expert as a politician in his response until he turns it into a friggin&apos; Subway plug, of all beautiful things, even though the donation had nothing whatsoever to do with Subway, and the Subway guys are back here high-fiving Russ, Suh&apos;s marketing agent, who <em>told them so</em>, because Ndamukong is good, is loyal, is <em>always obedient</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.9"> I&apos;m trying to square these: dutiful performer, dirty player, mute monster. He is a tangle of contradiction, or he is a man of deliberate calculation and design. After the show we ride the elevator in silence, except when he offers me the hoagie to take home.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.a">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.b"> Ndamukong (en-<em>da</em>-meh-kon) means &quot;house of spears&quot; in the language of the Ngemba tribe of Cameroon, the small country in Africa where his dad grew up. His mom is from Jamaica. His sister, Ngum&#x2014;&quot;giver of strength, giver of power&quot;&#x2014;came first, and four years later, Ndamukong, named after his great-grandfather who famously stood seven feet three. They were different from other kids in middle-class Portland, Oregon. Their parents, who divorced when the kids were still preschoolers, were strict rulers, demanding way more respect than other parents. Family tradition dictated that the older sibling <em>make</em> something of herself and then turn her attention to the younger, for whom she is responsible. At 29, Ngum is Suh&apos;s manager, scheduler, gatekeeper. He does nothing without consulting Ngum. No one gets to him without going through Ngum, who calls herself &quot;my brother&apos;s keeper.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.c"> &quot;Everything off the field, I got it; that&apos;s the motto,&quot; she&apos;s saying. &quot;I didn&apos;t really have a choice. It&apos;s a family business, and this is my job.&quot; We&apos;re driving toward their dad&apos;s house in Portland, and she&apos;s showing me around the neighborhood, split-levels, small yards occasionally separated by chain-link dog fences, clematis vines, and short driveways with lying-down bikes. I make the point to Ngum that getting to know her brother is like trying to catch a cat.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.d"> &quot;It can be taken as rude,&quot; she says.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.e"> &quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.f"> &quot;But it&apos;s not&#x2014;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.g"> She&apos;s wearing a haphazard braid down her back, a chiseled face, model-beautiful. &quot;He grew up quiet,&quot; she says. &quot;He would not talk. You almost wanted to start worrying. In middle school, I was like, <em>&apos;What&apos;s wrong with you?&apos;</em> He just studies every situation before speaking. He was always that way. And then it turned out he had a photographic memory. His style of learning is just...sick.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.h"> The house is simple, low, with green siding and a concrete stoop, and there&apos;s a blue van out front advertising Suh Son Mechanical LLC, their dad&apos;s heating-and-air-conditioning business. Suh&apos;s black BMW 750Li is parked next to it, the only sign that anything spectacular may be going on here at all. The garage door rises when she pushes the button, and she asks me not to mind the mess. &quot;He&apos;s probably in his room,&quot; Ngum says. &quot;Our rooms are across from each other. Our parents are like, culturally, there&apos;s no reason to move out unless you&apos;re married, you know?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.i"> I mumble something polite about how a lot of people move home after college, so this is nothing...odd?</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.j"> Do I need to point out that her brother will earn $68 million&#x2014;and that&apos;s before his endorsements with Nike, Chrysler, and all the rest? Do I need to point out that her brother is fourteenth on the <em>Forbes</em> list of the world&apos;s hundred highest-paid athletes?</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.k"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558319ec3655c24c6c95a7de/master/w_806/sports-2012-09-suh-inset-01.jpg" alt="sports-2012-09-suh-inset-01.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;t=sports-2012-09-suh-inset-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;t=sports-2012-09-suh-inset-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558319ec3655c24c6c95a7de%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fsports-2012-09-suh-inset-01.jpg&amp;description=sports-2012-09-suh-inset-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558319ec3655c24c6c95a7de%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fsports-2012-09-suh-inset-01.jpg&amp;description=sports-2012-09-suh-inset-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.l"> _The Suhs (from left): sister Ngum, father Michael, and</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.m"> shy, quiet Ndamukong, whose name means &quot;house of</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.n"> spears.&quot;_</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.o"> The <em>world&apos;s. </em></p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.p"> Suh recently bought a house outside Detroit, where he and Ngum live during the season, and they have a place in Houston, but Portland is home during the off-season. It&apos;s comfortable. It&apos;s got that nice, big training facility at the Nike headquarters nearby. It&apos;s <em>home</em>, and returning to it is a sign of respect. Just like, she says, not drinking in front of your parents is a sign of respect. And not cursing in front of your parents. &quot;I think he curses on the football field,&quot; Ngum says, holding her lips tight. &quot;I can see it.&quot; One time he called her and told her he got a tattoo. &quot;I was getting ready to throw up,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;m like, &apos;How am I going to hide that from Mom and Dad? <em>They are going to see it!</em>&apos; I was almost in tears. And then he&apos;s like, &apos;Just kidding.&apos; I was going to kill him. That was not a funny joke at all.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.q"> I make the point that he&apos;s a 25-year-old filthy-rich feared monster athlete who can bench-press 475 pounds. He can&apos;t get a tattoo?</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.r"> &quot;Oh, my gosh, no!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.s"> Ngum makes Ndamukong come out of his room and eat lunch with us, and at the restaurant he stays buried in his BlackBerry, then his iPhone, then his BlackBerry again, but after he finishes a heaping mound of pad thai, she looks at him and says, &quot;Well?&quot; and makes him talk to me about his approach, each week, as he prepares to crush quarterbacks.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.t"> &quot;Mondays I sleep,&quot; he offers. He&apos;s dressed in black workout gear, and he takes up so much space at the table everything around him looks miniature. &quot;I go in at ten, do my lift, watch the game from the day before. Tuesday is off, but I go in, lift, watch film. Then I have French toast with my sister.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.u"> &quot;We love French toast,&quot; she says.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.v"> &quot;French toast Tuesdays,&quot; he says. &quot;Then I study. I understand the whole plan by Thursday. Friday I memorize it. Then I cut my brain off from football. That&apos;s how I treat it: Don&apos;t let your brain get overheated. Saturday night I eat by myself, go over it, like final exams. Take a picture of it with my brain, like. It gets imprinted on my brain. Then, when that week is over, I slash it out and start putting the new stuff in.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.w"> He pauses, looks at her, shrugs.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.x"> &quot;That&apos;s basically it during the season,&quot; she says. &quot;That&apos;s about it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.y"> He says he has to go. She invites me to come to the house later for dinner to talk more. But he blows off dinner, disappears, and she can&apos;t find him, so she checks her Twitter feed, because that&apos;s the easiest way; some fan just spotted Ndamukong Suh at Costco looking at TVs.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.z">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.10"> The stomping. Every time I bring it up, people here seem vaguely startled. <em>Why are we talking about this again? </em></p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.11"> &quot;This is sports,&quot; says his dad, Michael. &quot;Sometimes you go out there and you&apos;re going to stomp on somebody.&quot; He himself is a soccer man, a star back home in his village. That&apos;s what his kids were supposed to play. &quot;I&apos;m behind in American football,&quot; he allows. &quot;Even now, I&apos;m not all the way up on it.&quot; He&apos;s a slight, tidy man&#x2014;only five eight&#x2014;with a round face encircled with unapologetic fuzz. He&apos;s sitting at a desk in his basement, where he just finished a bid for a job installing a furnace.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.12"> Ndamukong started out playing soccer, like his sister before him. She excelled at it, played for Mississippi State, made the Cameroon national team. He was different, clearly an athlete but so damn big, an oaf out there rumbling down the pitch, knocking kids over, helping them up, lifting them with one hand by the shorts. Like the Jolly Green Giant on the TV commercials. He was good at basketball, too, but it was always <em>hold back, hold back</em>, his body pushing him to go bigger, wider, broader, the world telling him: No. You&apos;ll hurt somebody. He tried shot put, threw sixty-one feet, four inches, state champion. So that was easy. But football&#x2014;now, football looked interesting. His dad said no way. Football was scary. His mom said no way. Football was violent, and don&apos;t forget academics comes first. &quot;Then one day he came home and said, &apos;You gonna come watch my game?&apos; &quot; his dad recalls. &quot;I said, &apos;What game?&apos; He said, &apos;Football.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.13"> Coaches had been begging him to play. A kid that big? That nimble? His first year trying, a sophomore, he played varsity. A prodigy. He had always been &quot;a fine-tuned kid,&quot; teachers said; he could be a surgeon the way he focused, the way he would lock into any task you gave him, and when football came along he locked all of himself in there. Physically the game was a liberation. Suddenly his size, his muscle mass, were assets. It was like coming out of the closet. He was <em>encouraged</em> to hit people. &quot;It&apos;s okay, Dad,&quot; he said. &quot;The position I&apos;m playing, they&apos;re scared of me. I don&apos;t get hit. I hit them.&quot; He said, &quot;It&apos;s okay, Mom. Come see.&quot; He had maintained a 3.0, as she&apos;d demanded, and he&apos;d all but solved the issue about getting hurt, so there was nothing his parents could do.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.14"> In a blink he was at Nebraska, cementing his name in the record books, then Detroit, where Lions coaches saw in Suh what Husker coaches had so readily seen. &quot;Cerebral,&quot; former Nebraska defensive coordinator Carl Pelini used to say. &quot;Hungry.&quot; One of the strongest guys he&apos;d ever seen play the game, coupled with the focus and discipline of a nerd. Suh used to meet with Pelini separately, weekly, talk about every defensive position on the field, study the possibilities and combinations like a chess player, turning plays over and inside out and over in his mind. His rookie year in Detroit, he was the same. On the field, on the line, it was the same. &quot;Suh plays super intense and super emotional,&quot; says Packers offensive lineman Josh Sitton, who knows what it&apos;s like to breathe his steam. &quot;He definitely plays violently. And with a few things he&apos;s done, that line becomes very thin between playing violent and playing nasty.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.15"> Suh&apos;s dad was at Ford Field on that Thanksgiving Day when his son got ejected for stomping Evan Dietrich-Smith (who would go on to hate having his career defined by two seconds of airtime&#x2014;the guy who got stomped). &quot;I saw it,&quot; Suh&apos;s dad recalls. &quot;I thought, it&apos;s part of the game. A lot of violent things happen. Referees always read the reaction. They do not see the action that started it.&quot; Context, he says. Everything in context. &quot;It did not look like a stomp to me, it looked like somebody grabbing you and you trying to shake him off.&quot; <em>Bam!</em> The foot. Dietrich-Smith&apos;s arm. Slow it down. Look at it again. Slow it down. That&apos;s what happened, Suh&apos;s dad says. Anybody looks at anything long enough, they&apos;ll see what they want to see. They wanted a villain, and they picked his son.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.16"> The stomping was not something anyone in the family recognized as Suh&apos;s fault. At most, an accident. So it was not, &quot;Oh, we have to rein in that wild child.&quot; Or, &quot;tame that evil demon.&quot; He was never a wild child, had no more demons than the next guy. To them the stomping was simply bad luck. Just three games on TV that day, not much else for people to talk about. A bit of bad PR for the Suh brand. <em>You mean people aren&apos;t over that yet? </em></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.17"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558319ec09f0bee564411eba/master/w_806/sports-2012-09-suh-inset-02.jpg" alt="sports-2012-09-suh-inset-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;t=sports-2012-09-suh-inset-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;t=sports-2012-09-suh-inset-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558319ec09f0bee564411eba%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fsports-2012-09-suh-inset-02.jpg&amp;description=sports-2012-09-suh-inset-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fndamukong-suh-gq-september-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558319ec09f0bee564411eba%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fsports-2012-09-suh-inset-02.jpg&amp;description=sports-2012-09-suh-inset-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.18"> __</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.19"> &quot;You want to come out to the driveway and see my van?&quot; his dad asks. Suh Son LLC. He put &quot; Son&quot; on the van when Ndamukong graduated from college, because that was always the plan. &quot;He got his degree in construction management,&quot; he points out. A family business, another option for Ndamukong to go into someday, his dad thinks.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> Suh&apos;s mother, across town, is no different. The bubble. The sister, the father, the mother, everyone in this family seems to be in some bubble distinctly removed from the American culture of celebrity, a situation that is not necessarily terribly odd, except they have an American celebrity in it. I&apos;m not yet convinced Ndamukong is complicit in creating the kind of fame he&apos;s selling, feeding an audience hungry for violence week after week.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> &quot;On the TV they&apos;re saying my son is angry,&quot; Suh&apos;s mom says. She&apos;s lanky, somewhat nervous, a schoolteacher for thirty-two years who still walks down the block to the classroom each morning from her small clapboard house. &quot;They&apos;re building it up that he&apos;s an angry man,&quot; she says. &quot;What does this child have to be angry about? This child is blessed. He has nothing to be angry about. So I don&apos;t know where they&apos;re getting that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> She talks to me from her doorway. &quot;You know, I came to the conclusion last year, after he got that suspension, that maybe he just doesn&apos;t need to give 200 percent when he plays football,&quot; she says. &quot;Do you know it&apos;s being perceived as a bad thing?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> I tell her yes, I know that.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> &quot;You want to see his room?&quot; she asks, leading me through the bright blue dining room she painted well before her son started wearing Lion blue. His bedroom&#x2014;tiny, jammed with football stuff&#x2014;is not a shrine so much as something to show the neighborhood kids who come knocking. &quot;I need to update it. I&apos;ve got way more Nebraska stuff than Detroit. Popcorn bowls with his name on them, a Lions tail, ticket stubs, a Lions toothbrush, look at this, just stuff. Stuff, you know? I lead the kids back, and then at the end I show them...it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> It? Apparently, there&apos;s a logic to the collection, a purpose.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> She walks up to his black Husker graduation gown hanging on the closet door, reaches to straighten a fold at the top. &quot;I just leave it hanging right here, kind of like the grand finale.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1h"> I tell her frankly that I don&apos;t think the neighborhood kids are coming by to see Ndamukong Suh&apos;s graduation gown.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1i"> &quot;I don&apos;t know what he did with the cap,&quot; she says. &quot;I wanted that, too, but I&apos;m just kind of satisfied with the gown.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1j">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1k"> Nothing happens that makes Suh decide to talk to me, nothing particular or funny or unusual, but when he decides to talk, he comes on like a truck.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1l"> We&apos;re in the training facility of the Nike headquarters, a sprawling campus of flowering ornamental trees lined up just so in front of rows of towering evergreens. Hushed, like a holy place, where fog settles between office buildings connected by garden pathways. Inside, the training building is all blond wood and black, vast, vaulted ceilings, photos of sweating determined faces blown up huge and towering over us like stained-glass windows in a cathedral. Sports may be the last institution of deference left in America&#x2014;the body, the will, the fight&#x2014;here&apos;s what irony and cynicism cannot yet touch.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1m"> Trainers love Suh because he does what he&apos;s told. It&apos;s refreshing. Like when a teacher gets a kid who does all his homework without once whining. &quot;It&apos;s easy with Suh, because he buys into it,&quot; says trainer Keith D&apos;Amelio. &quot;He sees the big picture. Athletes in general don&apos;t really understand why they&apos;re training. Just going in throwing weights isn&apos;t gonna do it.&quot; He tells me about Suh&apos;s assessment plan, everything monitored, every movement, even his sleep&#x2014;how much REM? Can we improve it? They work on range of motion, patterns of motion, muscle combinations. &quot;Suh&apos;s going to be a monster no matter what I do; he&apos;s as strong and powerful as they come. So what we do here is: Use it. Enhance it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1n"> When I got here this morning, Suh was on the ground pouring with sweat, doing push-ups with chains draped over his back and neck, chains as thick as my arm, doing what he&apos;s told, all obedience&#x2014;to his trainers, to his coaches, to the NFL, to America. We did, after all, ask for this. The biggest kid, the toughest kid, the kid who doesn&apos;t hold back, uses his gifts, develops them, fine-tunes them, becomes the machine. He&apos;s a masterpiece of our creation. And now, if he&apos;s run amok, well, shame on...him? For America to take any responsibility is to take the fun out of football, so forget that. Forget all the chatter about concussions. We&apos;re not supposed to think about any of that stuff when it comes to our most successful sports league ever. We&apos;re supposed to buy into the new narrative that the NFL cares. Crack down on hits. Fine players who can&apos;t stop their bodies at eighteen miles an hour in the split second before impact. It&apos;s a truce. We know it&apos;s pretense; they bank on our willingness to deny our own hypocrisy.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1o"> I was thinking about this stuff when Ngum called, asked me if Suh had talked to me yet, and I said no. Then Suh finished the workout and walked up to grab a towel, came so close to me I could feel the heat off him, and I smiled as anyone would smile to begin a conversation, but he took a towel and without once looking at me passed by and headed to the locker room. A few minutes later I got a call from Ngum saying he&apos;d meet me in the cafeteria. He was going to talk. She told me he was definitely going to talk.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1p">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1q"> He has eggs. He&apos;s sitting across from me, and the cafeteria is closed, no one else here at all except the people in the kitchen who were kind enough to cook the eggs. &quot;A lot of people don&apos;t know truly who I am,&quot; he tells me. &quot;And at this point in time, there are not a lot of people I let close enough to find out.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1r"> I tell him I noticed. I decide it&apos;s not my place to tell him his evasiveness is extreme to the point of creepy.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1s"> &quot;I don&apos;t want anybody in my circle that&apos;s a cancer to what I&apos;m trying to create,&quot; he says. &quot;So stay on the outside and make your opinions. They&apos;re going to be meaningless to everything in the circle. The boundaries are up for me to keep, and a responsibility of my family, too. That&apos;s why, like, I guess you&apos;ve gone through a good screening process.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1t"> Apparently, there&apos;s a compliment in here somewhere. (Cancer?) I ask him about being named the dirtiest player in the NFL.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1u"> &quot;It&apos;s not the norm, I guess, to see someone as aggressive as me being more or less very athletic. You see me running, having a big, violent hit, it&apos;s going to look bad, but that&apos;s the natural ability I&apos;ve been given. Why would I let it run to the wayside and not use it?</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1v"> &quot;Football is a violent sport. Somebody&apos;s going to get hurt. It&apos;s the game. Just hopefully, you&apos;re on the good side of it. So I don&apos;t, I really don&apos;t get the controversy. It&apos;s <em>the game</em>.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1w"> &quot;You play it dirty,&quot; I say. &quot;Dirty is wrong.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1x"> He says no. Emphatically no. <em>He&apos;s not dirty</em>. &quot;A dirty player is somebody who ultimately is <em>trying</em> to hurt somebody. There&apos;s a huge difference. There&apos;s no gray in that. Like, you have no conscience, no nothing, no guilt. I don&apos;t have that mean streak in me. I don&apos;t play angry. It&apos;s not <em>anger</em>.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1y"> He&apos;s not, notably, jabbing his food like an angry person. In fact, his movements are gentle; his eyes scan the room as he thinks.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.1z"> &quot;When I first started playing, I was surprised at the fact that I was allowed to hit people as hard as I could and not get in trouble. Because in soccer, when you get to a certain level, you can slide-tackle and take them off their feet, but you have to always hit the ball first and then take that person out. But in football, that&apos;s not true. You can run as hard as you can into somebody else and take them down. Thumbs up!</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.20"> &quot;But as far as I know, I&apos;ve never hurt anybody through playing the game of football.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.21"> I ask him about concussions, all the headlines now about guys like Junior Seau killing themselves, likely as a result of what football did to their brains.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.22"> &quot;I think concussions are really important, but I don&apos;t think if you look back at any of my hits, there&apos;s nothing in the hit that would cause concussions. Maybe whiplash. That&apos;s not because of me, that&apos;s because somebody doesn&apos;t know how to take a hit. I&apos;m not doing helmet-to-helmet hits. I might hit somebody under their chin because I hit them in their chest and I rise up, because that&apos;s how we were taught to play football. Hit them and run your feet through. Eventually you&apos;re going to come up through the person. Concussions, I don&apos;t think, really fall into my category.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.23"> It&apos;s odd to me that the guy with the rap as the dirtiest player in the NFL isn&apos;t more up on this stuff. I thought the NFL was on a campaign to explain brain injuries to its players, to warn them. <em>It&apos;s not just about concussions.</em> It&apos;s the subconcussive hits, the constant <em>bam, bam, bam</em> that linemen like Suh give and receive. Those are the hits scientists say cause the lasting damage to the brain, the kind of injuries that made guys like Mike Webster, Terry Long, and so many others go crazy. The subconcussive hits&#x2014;every single play.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.24"> &quot;Go hard <em>every single play</em>,&quot; Suh says. &quot;That&apos;s how I&apos;ve been taught. So now, when they see that and that correlates to big plays, things that aren&apos;t in the norm, for them to justify it, they can&apos;t just say, Oh, it&apos;s a different person, it&apos;s a different breed of player, so they say, Oh, he&apos;s just dirty. That&apos;s their easy scapegoat.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.25"> &quot;It&apos;s like, I open the throttle too much? I get in trouble for opening my throttle...just like being on a jet. Like, you know, when they&apos;re starting a plane, you just gradually, gradually throw it into full throttle. I&apos;m <em>always</em> in full throttle. But they tell me now I need to be at three-quarters of a throttle.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.26"> &quot;The NFL, I don&apos;t know what their role is. I guess they have to punish. But at the same time, when I see the big Jay Cutler hit that I had in my rookie season, I supposedly hit him in the back of his head. I hit him in his nameplate. I got a fine for that, but yet you see on the NFL network or NFL.com it&apos;s publicized, it gets played millions and millions of times. So it&apos;s like a good thing, but it&apos;s a bad thing.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.27"> &quot;I don&apos;t want to snap anybody&apos;s neck off. I was brought up to treat others like you want to be treated.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.28"> And yet he stomps on a guy&#x2014;after the whistle is blown.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.29"> &quot;If you slow down and analyze anything, it&apos;s going to look worse in my opinion. It was not intentional. If it was intentional, it could have been a lot worse.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2a"> &quot;If I wanted to go out there to hurt somebody,<em> I could hurt somebody</em>. I don&apos;t want any part of that.&quot; Hurting is too easy. Too obvious. A yawn, in that regard. Beating someone is different from hurting someone. Beating someone, he says, <em>that&apos;s the game</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2b"> &quot;I mean, if I wanted to hurt you, I&apos;d go for your quarterback. Because me stopping your play is going to frustrate you more than me physically hurting you. Because I&apos;m just that much better than you. That&apos;s how I look at it. It&apos;s like killing somebody with kindness.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2c"> Kindness. I promise him that <em>kindness</em> is not the word I expected to be considering when talking to Ndamukong Suh. I tell him I&apos;m not getting <em>kindness</em>. He says <em>irritating</em> might be a better word. He knows he&apos;s irritating. He&apos;s proud of that.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2d"> &quot;It&apos;s mind games. A lot of mind games,&quot; he says. He describes a play, like so many plays: trapped by two linemen, dodging one, throwing the other off, reaching the quarterback with all he had. &quot;All you hear is the wind being taken out of him, and he&apos;s, like, Oh sh&#x2014;. I get enjoyment out of that. I like big hits because I impose my will.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2e"> &quot;Getting an interception or a fumble or a recovery or a touchdown, that&apos;s out of this world, that&apos;s an amazing feeling,&quot; he continues. &quot;But to be honest with you, it&apos;s more rewarding for me to get a sack. There&apos;s luck that goes into creating an interception, scoring a touchdown, but there&apos;s no luck in a sack.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2f"> &quot;I love hitting Aaron Rodgers, Jay Cutler. Ben Roethlisberger, I would like to go against him, because they say he&apos;s one of the hardest to take down. I see that as a challenge, so I would love to take him down multiple times. Peyton Manning, oh, I would love that. I think Michael Vick, I did sack him, one of the most elusive quarterbacks to ever play the game. I took him down with one arm.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2g"> He goes on. The guy who would not speak now can&apos;t be interrupted, talking hits, hits, the joy of hits.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2h"> The stomping, he says one last time, was not intentional. He knows it. His family knows it. He is going to protect that mythology no matter what. He will ignore the people who say otherwise. He will stay inside the bubble and refuse to let any of that cancer in.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2i"> &quot;For me personally? It&apos;s over,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s something that happened in the 2011 season. Will it follow me? I think it will follow me because of the outside world. It won&apos;t follow me because of me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2j"> It occurs to me that whatever role American celebrity has assigned him, and no matter how complicit he is in that transaction, he remains a 25-year-old young man who grew up painfully shy and obedient, and he isn&apos;t all that different today, except now we&apos;ve turned him into a pepperoni head.</p><p data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.4.2k"> &quot;I&apos;m quiet,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m very quiet. I&apos;m a very good observer. That&apos;s just the way I am. If I&apos;m speaking, it&apos;s because it&apos;s meaningful.&quot;</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".95p30nxukg.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div
