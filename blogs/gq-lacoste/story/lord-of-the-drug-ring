  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestPhoto: SUN/Newscom\u000A\u000AListen to the silence. Bougainvilleas drip red in the parking area just off 10th Street in McAllen, Texas. The day will be warm, with little wind. At 10:53 A.M., it is almost sixty-five degrees. Comandante Guillermo Gonz&amp;#xE1;lez Calderoni has been in the office of his lawyer, Roberto Yzaguirre, for almost an hour, talking. He desperately wants to buy a ranch and has, against all custom, come in early—he never stirs much before noon—with his sidekick, Chato. Yzaguirre calms him down, tells him no, we cannot look at the property today, but we can go out Saturday if you wish. Calderoni reluctantly agrees to wait. He is anxious for this ranch. He had many ranches in Mexico before he fled ten years ago and the government seized them.\u000A\u000AThis very morning, he has driven from the gated community where he lives, has left his beautiful young wife and has come here about this passion for a ranch. And now, the meeting over, he is standing in the lobby of Yzaguirre\u0027s office, with its stone wall and green leather mahogany furniture, saying good-bye to his gravelly voiced lawyer and flirting with the receptionist. Calderoni is a peacock of a man, dressed nattily in fine fabrics and handmade boots, quick eyed and fluent in English, Spanish and French. He has a keen eye for women—his second wife was a beauty queen—and is a legendary shot with a .45, the weapon he is said to keep in his boot. He has lived for the past decade in McAllen, a few minutes from Mexico, a country that claims he is a major criminal and has sought his extradition. This hardly seems to concern him. No, at the moment he is all about this ranch he must have.\u000A\u000AHe has sixty seconds or so left as he steps outside and walks to his parked Mercedes. Calderoni slides behind the wheel; Chato sits beside him. There is the slam of brakes as a car pins the Mercedes into its slot; then a man leaps from the passenger side, takes two or three steps and fires one shot into the Comandante\u0027s neck. The car roars away, and the Comandante\u0027s head rolls back. He will be declared dead at a hospital in just over an hour.\u000A\u000AOnly Chato witnesses the murder. He is sitting beside Calderoni in the car, yet no one harms him. At first he gives the police a description: two men with dark skin, a Chrysler with Louisiana plates. Later the police cast doubt upon his story, saying he is too upset to recall what he has seen. The next day, they find the Chrysler about a mile away. The plates turn out to be stolen. On the window is a decal for the Mexican Red Cross. At that, the trail goes dead.\u000A\u000AThere is a brief flurry of notice, and then the fantasies begin. Within days the Mexican press announces that the FBI beat local cops to the murder scene. A rumor hits the U.S. press that a Mexican drug leader paid $3 million for the hit. A magazine claims the Comandante was getting ready to return to Mexico and tell all. An old colleague of his says it was a contract killing from the ruling class of Mexico.\u000A\u000AAnd then the footprints of Calderoni\u0027s life begin to blow away as the ground shifts in the secret world where he thrived. Just five days after his death, he is already well on his way to being a figure known by a few old cops, a story told in murderous cantinas, a memory to some beautiful women as they rest their heads against their fine pillows in those special moments just before sleep comes. He was the man who knew everything, and his death means that now things will never be known. That is the way of the world that produced him—a world that was not really Mexico or the border or the drug wars, but the world of spies, secrets, agents, networks—the basic elements governments have found so necessary as events overwhelmed simple customs and laws. Ask around and it\u0027s unlikely you\u0027ll find a man who even knows his name, unless he has entered certain rooms under certain conditions and tasted certain pains.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AI can taste things sometimes.\u000A\u000AIn November 2001, I was in a border city where eight girls had been buried in a ditch splattered with sunflowers in bloom. I left the grave site and went to a country club in a gated community where the Mexican rich huddled. I entered the bar, which overlooked the golf course, ordered a drink and began taking notes on what I\u0027d seen. A couple of hundred yards away was the home of the head of a major drug cartel. This bar and this country club were his playground. I remember the anger rising in me over the dead girls, over the rich ignoring the poor, over the protection granted the drug merchant who lived a football field from where I sat. Calderoni had once been the boss of this town.\u000A\u000ASometimes when I\u0027m in the mood in strange cities, I go to suicide bars—the kind of places where, by the second beer, someone is going to call you out. I do this because I am angry and looking for trouble. I felt the same way in this country club. As I sipped my drink and took notes, the waiters stared at me. Then I could hear them on the phone. I was with a Mexican, and as time passed he became very worried.\u000A\u000AWe got up and left. As we walked down the palatial steps fronting the clubhouse, an unmarked state-police car wheeled up, the two men in it staring at us with eyes. Someone had called them; the Mexican and I knew this in our bones. We walked past. Had we stayed five more minutes in the bar, things could have turned out differently.\u000A\u000AI think of my drinks and note-making in the country-club bar as a kind of Calderoni moment. He lived in that zone where violence floods the air like lilacs in springtime, and he was at the beck and call of those who needed someone murdered or vanished pronto. Sometimes he answered the call and took care of business. On that warm Wednesday morning last February in McAllen, someone else got the call, and then someone took care of him.\u000A\u000AThat is how things happen in this world beneath our smug notice and official pieties. Americans, and I count myself among them, are fools, oblivious of the screams shredding the air. Mexicans drink darker truths.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe small metal statue of the steer and mounted cowboy sleeps on the huge wooden conference table in the dead man\u0027s office. It has been just five days since the Comandante\u0027s ecution. The son\u0027s voice purls out soft words as he sits at his father\u0027s oak desk in the trading company near the border. He wears slacks, loafers and a plaid cotton shirt and has all the élan of a bookkeeper. He is explaining that his father lived an honorable life and died an honorable death. One bullet to the neck and he was gone. The son sweeps his arms as if holding a machine gun, goes ack! ack! ack! as he demonstrates the gory alternatives and says he is grateful that his father was not disfigured by death, which, he notes once again, came swiftly, almost tranquilly. The office has the feeling of a place where decisions are made but papers seldom shuffied. The conference table squats, with no chairs. A desk gleams clean of paper. The phone rings only once during the hour we talk, and that with a call from the son\u0027s mother, Calderoni\u0027s first wife.\u000A\u000AI\u0027m here because I\u0027ve just come off seven years in the drug world, writing a book, and during those years Calderoni has stalked my thoughts, a thread running through everything and yet refusing to explain anything. I talked to men who had been on raids with him, talked to a man who had been one of his pistoleros, saw the fear his name evoked wash across the faces of many along the border. For almost twenty years, nothing of consequence happened in Mexico\u0027s drug world without Calderoni\u0027s hand being present. But I never met or talked to the Comandante, who by nature did not answer questions but asked them. He had become a fantasy in my mind, living in his mansion in McAllen with his millions and his pack of blooded Rottweilers. His death offered the last open window into his life I was ever likely to see. So I flew to Texas, rented a car and came down to the border before the body grew too cool.\u000A\u000AThe son explains that his father and he lived separate lives, that his father\u0027s business was his father\u0027s business, that he has followed a different path. He has spoken to no one in the press since his father\u0027s death, he rolls on, because he wants his father to rest in peace. But then, I know, everyone wants his father to rest in peace—and especially to stay silent. Epoca, a Mexican magazine, runs a simple graphic to announce the murder: Calderoni\u0027s face with a gun to his head and, imprinted on the mouth, the universal symbol of a circle with a slash across it. The New York Times dismisses the killing with seventy-odd words and then, twelve days later, runs an article explaining that Comandante Calderoni was a creature from the past, a footnote to an era that is now \u0022as remote and romantic as cowboys and Indians.\u0022 The world, the paper asserts, has moved on to an age of terror, a fact that makes the high jinks of a Calderoni both quaint and irrelevant.\u000A\u000AThe son, in his utter calm, seems to agree. Ah, he explains, he knows nothing of his father\u0027s activities; he simply runs the family business, this trading company where the phones hardly ever ring, this large building full of offices with nothing going on in them.\u000A\u000AJust what does the firm export? An oil, yes, an oil, the son explains, a special oil, though he cannot quite remember what it is at the moment. And drinks, yes, wine and vodka, things like that also. There is no evidence of any samples in the silent building, nothing to indicate activity except numerous paper-shredding machines.\u000A\u000AHis father was shot on Wednesday, February 5, 2003, at 10:54 A.M. The funeral was Friday, followed quickly by a cremation because, the son continues, his father had always expressed a wish to be free of the grave, to be part of the wind and the world. So as we sit on Monday in the late afternoon, everything is over; the era of cowboys and Indians has ended. There is only the desire for quiet, a desire shared by people in many places: in the FBI, in DEA, in the highest reaches of the Mexican government, in the largest drug organizations on earth, in the vaults of American secrets where clerks quietly bury unseemly sections of the history of the United States.\u000A\u000AI nod at the son, say that I understand. And I do.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AI learned about Comandante Calderoni the normal way you learn about things on the border—voices whispering with fear, heads bending low over cups of coffee in cheap cafés, people looking over their shoulders and softly saying his name. I\u0027ll get to the little facts on which we build our lies in a moment. But first I want to revisit the place where the real facts kill you dead.\u000A\u000AYears ago I lived in a small town along the base of the Sierra Madre where most of the population survived by producing or shipping drugs. I met a widow there whose husband had been the Mexican equivalent of a county attorney. One day he and his wife had gone down to the plaza to buy ice cream cones. The air was full of laughter, the sidewalks packed with families and lovers promenading, the air sagging with the scent of flowers. Two men walked up, shot him dead, strolled down the block and climbed into a taxi. No one got a good look at them. The taxi driver had no memory of where he took them. The widow eventually got a job with the Mexican federal police, or federales. Soon she owned nice houses in the capital, on the beach. I would see her at parties laughing, her lips red, her body wrapped in fine garments.\u000A\u000AI told myself I did not understand. Now I do. There is a reason to forget.\u000A\u000AI\u0027ll tell you irrelevant details. If you work in a border factory in Mexico, one most likely owned by an American corporation, you will work four hours and fifty minutes to buy one pound of beef. You will work three hours and nine minutes to buy a half gallon of milk. You will work fifty-five minutes for a bar of soap. You will work over eleven hours to buy your kid a new pair of pants. I\u0027ve taught myself to say it is not my problem, to say it does not justify the drug trade, to say it will all work out in the end, just give it a spell. Most days I\u0027m a fair hand at saying these things.\u000A\u000AYou will learn to forget things, too. You will learn things you will always remember. And after the blood dries, you will dance and want and try to get pretty things. And you will know in every cell of your being that nothing that happens to you will ever be known to North Americans sitting in their safe houses with their perfect toilets and their freeze-dried women.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ACalderoni came up in a well-off family, his father a success in the state-owned oil business. He mastered several languages, learned to be a good shot and by the early 1980s was a federale on the border. Soon he was a comandante. He took a million-dollar contract from one drug lord to kill another. (The FBI unknowingly helped him with this murder.) He hobnobbed with DEA agents, helped them out when he needed to and was flown to Washington for a personal tour of the inner sanctum of DEA intelligence. In the 1988 presidential election, he allegedly arranged the murders of key leaders of the opposition party and rigged the computers so that the ruling party\u0027s candidate, a man who almost certainly lost the popular vote, won the official vote. In 1992 he got in trouble and fled to the United States, across the Rio Grande. His official wealth was listed at about $7 million. While DEA protected him, it also knew he had more than a billion dollars in stashed assets. He had made his money by killing people. He had made his money by charging a toll to drug traffickers. He had made his money by doing the little dirty tasks commanded by the president of Mexico, Carlos Salinas. He had made his money by knowing how to forget and, of course, when to remember.\u000A\u000ACalderoni had thrived while working for the federales, a law team that combines all the virtues of the FBI and the Mafia. I once attended a wedding where drug dealers and federales drank, did drugs, fucked and celebrated together for five days. During the party, one federale major and a colleague left for a few hours, murdered two peasants who were smuggling drugs without paying them off, took the load of dope and sold it.\u000A\u000AA week later, that federale major was dead. When I asked what had happened to him, I was told \u0022his heart stopped.\u0022 It is, of course, not polite to pry. Just as when I drove by the state-police office each day and admired the towering marijuana plants that constituted the front lawn, I did not pry. Just as when I was run off the road by federales and had an AK-47 poked in my guts, I did not lose my civility.\u000A\u000ABut now, I think, I\u0027ll lose it.\u000A\u000AYou are holding this magazine, and you think, if you are a sane American, what does this obscure, dead comandante, Guillermo Calderoni, have to do with me? I\u0027ll tell you. He was a captain in an industry—the global dope business—that earns close to half a trillion dollars a year. He was an enforcer that made Mexico safe for your vacations and for your investments in factories where people work for next to nothing. Even if you don\u0027t have shares in some U.S. company with factories down in Mexico, you still get your slice of the pie every time you pick up some deal on a television or a VCR or thousands of other items made by people living in cardboard shacks all along the line.\u000A\u000AI once was talking to a Mexican woman in her twenties whose sister had been kidnapped, raped and murdered on the border. I asked, \u0022Just what did your sister do?\u0022\u000A\u000AShe looked at me with cold eyes and said, \u0022She made things for you.\u0022\u000A\u000AI keep going to Mexico, God knows why. Partly, I like the people. But mainly, things exist south of that river, on the other side of that fence. Big things, bloody things. Oh God, I love the ladies and the scent coming off their skin, the way they move in stiletto heels, nimble as goats. The beer\u0027s good, too, and I can\u0027t say enough about the beaches.\u000A\u000AThis other business, well, best not to talk about it. I\u0027m sure that\u0027s what the Comandante would advise me if he were still around.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ABy the mid-\u002780S, a legend had begun to trail Calderoni, one that struck awe in American FBI and DEA agents and terror in Mexican citizens. Rumors had spread that he interrogated with a bolt cutter or with pliers on the teeth. He became the guy who was sent in to clean up the various Dodge Citys of Mexico. When a drug leader in Ju&amp;#xE1;rez roughed up an American newspaper photographer in 1986 and the U.S. press demanded justice, Calderoni was the one who made it right. He did several things. He told the previous comandante in Ju&amp;#xE1;rez that he had twenty-four hours to get out of town. Then he went to the mansion of the offending drug leader—getting past his pet tiger, alligators and boa constrictors—and hauled the guy and his pistoleros off to prison. Then, as a separate venture, he flew through U.S. territory—escorted by FBI agents in American helicopters—to a small Mexican town near Ojinaga, Chihuahua, and killed Pablo Acosta, at that moment the major conduit of Colombian cocaine through Mexico into the United States. (The FBI was unaware that this was actually a contract killing for which Calderoni was paid $1 million.) Acosta\u0027s mistake was being featured in the press; he\u0027d given a front-page interview to an El Paso daily detailing his bribe payments to the Mexican government. This fame made him expendable. The FBI was so hungry for a headline blow against a major drug dealer that it kept its scheme with Calderoni a secret from DEA.\u000A\u000ABut to its consternation, the FBI also kept hearing of a different Calderoni from its snitches, information that the bureau buried in its files—in part because Calderoni was the kind of connection who could make a narc\u0027s career, a man who could hand over the big case all wrapped up in a ribbon with a bow, and in part because the FBI could not believe the truth, because it meant its Mexico was not the real Mexico, just as successive American administrations have ignored reports linking the Mexican president and the country\u0027s ruling class to the drug business. Just as the brother of one president of Mexico funneled roughly $100 million in drug money through one U.S. bank without anyone saying a word in the regulatory agencies. The U.S. government knows very little about Mexicans. Except, of course, that they continue to flee the country the U.S. government helps to sustain.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIn 1996, Calderoni mysteriously erupted in a huge story in The New York Times, complete with a photo of him and President Carlos Salinas. The story explained that Calderoni\u0027s earlier warnings to the American government of links between Mexico\u0027s $30-billion-a-year drug world and the Salinas administration had been ignored lest they upset international relationships and trade deals. The Comandante, in this singular newspaper appearance, made his point: I know, and if I\u0027m bothered, I will remember what I know.\u000A\u000AThen the Comandante vanished from public notice and became a man left to his golf game in Texas. For years I heard rumors that he had not truly retired, that he retained his network in Mexico, that he continued to help in contract killings and other housekeeping matters. When I would mention these rumors to people in DEA, I\u0027d receive a shrug and silence.\u000A\u000AThe agency wanted to forget what it really knew about Calderoni—about how, back in the \u002780s, when shipments of cocaine began to flood Mexico, the Comandante had prospered, and as he rose, so did his share of the action. During the Salinas years, an effort by U.S. operatives to pin down the Comandante\u0027s assets stalled when they reached $1 billion. And here the unreality returns as it always does in Mexico: a billion dollars flowing into the hands of a man who lived and died largely unknown to the American press and government. The Comandante prospered in this world of ignorance. He would work with DEA, seize loads left and right and do this because a part of him wanted to be a supercop. And then the Comandante would blame the seizures on DEA, even when the agency had nothing to do with them. DEA made busts, got headlines and had a valiant antidrug Comandante to celebrate. The billion dollars stashed away? A detail.\u000A\u000A\u0022DEA never looked for Calderoni\u0027s money,\u0022 a retired U.S. government agent told me. \u0022DEA was in love with him.\u0022\u000A\u000ARetired to his mansion in McAllen, Calderoni continued to do what he had always done. He sold intelligence. He consulted with traffickers on how to bring drugs into the United States. He blackmailed leading Mexican politicians with his tapes. He flourished as if the flight from his police post and nation had never occurred.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe church is modern, sterile, and reeks of a germproof United States, a fortress built to block the aromas drifting across the border. People come from Mexico for the Comandante\u0027s funeral, and St. Joseph the Worker in McAllen is packed. Retired DEA agents show up, along with many other people who do not advertise who or what they are. In death, it seems, the Comandante is finally safe to visit. One former DEA agent tells the press that the Comandante never took dirty money or played both sides against the other. Or did murder for hire. Which is only more evidence of the fantasy history peculiar to the war on drugs.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AI like to imagine the world of Comandante Calderoni: doing deep deals with the FBI and DEA and most likely the CIA; arresting, killing and charging multibillion-dollar drug cartels; carrying out the crimes and desires of the leaders of Mexico; and betraying all of them to each other and somehow keeping his footing, never spinning out of control, never flinching as one thing led to another. Living in McAllen, playing golf right there on the banks of the Rio Grande, where he faced a nation of harsh and corrupt power that wanted to jail him, as well as large organizations of cutthroats whom he had beaten, tortured, arrested and of course charged generously for the experience.\u000A\u000ANow he becomes ash and dust, becomes a footnote in a few American newspapers, becomes a file sealed in various agencies. His tracks across Mexican history and our own history are at this very moment blowing away in the wind.\u000A\u000ATime to open a cold beer, maybe head down to the playas. Mexico can be really colorful. Hell, you can\u0027t believe the parties—they go on for days. The water can be risky, some say, but you can bank on the beer and the women.\u000A\u000ACharles Bowden is a GQ writer at large. He doesn\u0027t drink white wine.",

Bougainvilleas drip red in the parking area just off 10th Street in McAllen, Texas. The day will be warm, with little wind. At 10:53 A.M., it is almost sixty-five degrees. Comandante Guillermo Gonz&amp;#xE1;lez Calderoni has been in the office of his lawyer, Roberto Yzaguirre, for almost an hour, talking. He desperately wants to buy a ranch and has, against all custom, come in early&#x2014;he never stirs much before noon&#x2014;with his sidekick, Chato. Yzaguirre calms him down, tells him no, we cannot look at the property today, but we can go out Saturday if you wish. Calderoni reluctantly agrees to wait. He is anxious for this ranch. He had many ranches in Mexico before he fled ten years ago and the government seized them.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.2">This very morning, he has driven from the gated community where he lives, has left his beautiful young wife and has come here about this passion for a ranch. And now, the meeting over, he is standing in the lobby of Yzaguirre&#x2019;s office, with its stone wall and green leather mahogany furniture, saying good-bye to his gravelly voiced lawyer and flirting with the receptionist. Calderoni is a peacock of a man, dressed nattily in fine fabrics and handmade boots, quick eyed and fluent in English, Spanish and French. He has a keen eye for women&#x2014;his second wife was a beauty queen&#x2014;and is a legendary shot with a .45, the weapon he is said to keep in his boot. He has lived for the past decade in McAllen, a few minutes from Mexico, a country that claims he is a major criminal and has sought his extradition. This hardly seems to concern him. No, at the moment he is all about this ranch he must have.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.3">He has sixty seconds or so left as he steps outside and walks to his parked Mercedes. Calderoni slides behind the wheel; Chato sits beside him. There is the slam of brakes as a car pins the Mercedes into its slot; then a man leaps from the passenger side, takes two or three steps and fires one shot into the Comandante&#x2019;s neck. The car roars away, and the Comandante&#x2019;s head rolls back. He will be declared dead at a hospital in just over an hour.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.5">Only Chato witnesses the murder. He is sitting beside Calderoni in the car, yet no one harms him. At first he gives the police a description: two men with dark skin, a Chrysler with Louisiana plates. Later the police cast doubt upon his story, saying he is too upset to recall what he has seen. The next day, they find the Chrysler about a mile away. The plates turn out to be stolen. On the window is a decal for the Mexican Red Cross. At that, the trail goes dead.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.6">There is a brief flurry of notice, and then the fantasies begin. Within days the Mexican press announces that the FBI beat local cops to the murder scene. A rumor hits the U.S. press that a Mexican drug leader paid $3 million for the hit. A magazine claims the Comandante was getting ready to return to Mexico and tell all. An old colleague of his says it was a contract killing from the ruling class of Mexico.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.7">And then the footprints of Calderoni&#x2019;s life begin to blow away as the ground shifts in the secret world where he thrived. Just five days after his death, he is already well on his way to being a figure known by a few old cops, a story told in murderous cantinas, a memory to some beautiful women as they rest their heads against their fine pillows in those special moments just before sleep comes. He was the man who knew everything, and his death means that now things will never be known. That is the way of the world that produced him&#x2014;a world that was not really Mexico or the border or the drug wars, but the world of spies, secrets, agents, networks&#x2014;the basic elements governments have found so necessary as events overwhelmed simple customs and laws. Ask around and it&#x2019;s unlikely you&#x2019;ll find a man who even knows his name, unless he has entered certain rooms under certain conditions and tasted certain pains.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.8"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.9">I can taste things sometimes.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.a">In November 2001, I was in a border city where eight girls had been buried in a ditch splattered with sunflowers in bloom. I left the grave site and went to a country club in a gated community where the Mexican rich huddled. I entered the bar, which overlooked the golf course, ordered a drink and began taking notes on what I&#x2019;d seen. A couple of hundred yards away was the home of the head of a major drug cartel. This bar and this country club were his playground. I remember the anger rising in me over the dead girls, over the rich ignoring the poor, over the protection granted the drug merchant who lived a football field from where I sat. Calderoni had once been the boss of this town.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.b">Sometimes when I&#x2019;m in the mood in strange cities, I go to suicide bars&#x2014;the kind of places where, by the second beer, someone is going to call you out. I do this because I am angry and looking for trouble. I felt the same way in this country club. As I sipped my drink and took notes, the waiters stared at me. Then I could hear them on the phone. I was with a Mexican, and as time passed he became very worried.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.c">We got up and left. As we walked down the palatial steps fronting the clubhouse, an unmarked state-police car wheeled up, the two men in it staring at us with eyes. Someone had called them; the Mexican and I knew this in our bones. We walked past. Had we stayed five more minutes in the bar, things could have turned out differently.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.d">I think of my drinks and note-making in the country-club bar as a kind of Calderoni moment. He lived in that zone where violence floods the air like lilacs in springtime, and he was at the beck and call of those who needed someone murdered or vanished pronto. Sometimes he answered the call and took care of business. On that warm Wednesday morning last February in McAllen, someone else got the call, and then someone took care of him.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.e">That is how things happen in this world beneath our smug notice and official pieties. Americans, and I count myself among them, are fools, oblivious of the screams shredding the air. Mexicans drink darker truths.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.f"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.g">The small metal statue of the steer and mounted cowboy sleeps on the huge wooden conference table in the dead man&#x2019;s office. It has been just five days since the Comandante&#x2019;s ecution. The son&#x2019;s voice purls out soft words as he sits at his father&#x2019;s oak desk in the trading company near the border. He wears slacks, loafers and a plaid cotton shirt and has all the &#xE9;lan of a bookkeeper. He is explaining that his father lived an honorable life and died an honorable death. One bullet to the neck and he was gone. The son sweeps his arms as if holding a machine gun, goes <em>ack! ack! ack!</em> as he demonstrates the gory alternatives and says he is grateful that his father was not disfigured by death, which, he notes once again, came swiftly, almost tranquilly. The office has the feeling of a place where decisions are made but papers seldom shuffied. The conference table squats, with no chairs. A desk gleams clean of paper. The phone rings only once during the hour we talk, and that with a call from the son&#x2019;s mother, Calderoni&#x2019;s first wife.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.h">I&#x2019;m here because I&#x2019;ve just come off seven years in the drug world, writing a book, and during those years Calderoni has stalked my thoughts, a thread running through everything and yet refusing to explain anything. I talked to men who had been on raids with him, talked to a man who had been one of his pistoleros, saw the fear his name evoked wash across the faces of many along the border. For almost twenty years, nothing of consequence happened in Mexico&#x2019;s drug world without Calderoni&#x2019;s hand being present. But I never met or talked to the Comandante, who by nature did not answer questions but asked them. He had become a fantasy in my mind, living in his mansion in McAllen with his millions and his pack of blooded Rottweilers. His death offered the last open window into his life I was ever likely to see. So I flew to Texas, rented a car and came down to the border before the body grew too cool.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.i">The son explains that his father and he lived separate lives, that his father&#x2019;s business was his father&#x2019;s business, that he has followed a different path. He has spoken to no one in the press since his father&#x2019;s death, he rolls on, because he wants his father to rest in peace. But then, I know, everyone wants his father to rest in peace&#x2014;and especially to stay silent. <em>Epoca,</em> a Mexican magazine, runs a simple graphic to announce the murder: Calderoni&#x2019;s face with a gun to his head and, imprinted on the mouth, the universal symbol of a circle with a slash across it. <em>The New York Times</em> dismisses the killing with seventy-odd words and then, twelve days later, runs an article explaining that Comandante Calderoni was a creature from the past, a footnote to an era that is now &quot;as remote and romantic as cowboys and Indians.&quot; The world, the paper asserts, has moved on to an age of terror, a fact that makes the high jinks of a Calderoni both quaint and irrelevant.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.j">The son, in his utter calm, seems to agree. Ah, he explains, he knows nothing of his father&#x2019;s activities; he simply runs the family business, this trading company where the phones hardly ever ring, this large building full of offices with nothing going on in them.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.k">Just what does the firm export? An oil, yes, an oil, the son explains, a <em>special</em> oil, though he cannot quite remember what it is at the moment. And drinks, yes, wine and vodka, things like that also. There is no evidence of any samples in the silent building, nothing to indicate activity except numerous paper-shredding machines.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.l">His father was shot on Wednesday, February 5, 2003, at 10:54 A.M. The funeral was Friday, followed quickly by a cremation because, the son continues, his father had always expressed a wish to be free of the grave, to be part of the wind and the world. So as we sit on Monday in the late afternoon, everything is over; the era of cowboys and Indians has ended. There is only the desire for quiet, a desire shared by people in many places: in the FBI, in DEA, in the highest reaches of the Mexican government, in the largest drug organizations on earth, in the vaults of American secrets where clerks quietly bury unseemly sections of the history of the United States.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.m">I nod at the son, say that I understand. And I do.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.n"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.o">I learned about Comandante Calderoni the normal way you learn about things on the border&#x2014;voices whispering with fear, heads bending low over cups of coffee in cheap caf&#xE9;s, people looking over their shoulders and softly saying his name. I&#x2019;ll get to the little facts on which we build our lies in a moment. But first I want to revisit the place where the real facts kill you dead.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.p">Years ago I lived in a small town along the base of the Sierra Madre where most of the population survived by producing or shipping drugs. I met a widow there whose husband had been the Mexican equivalent of a county attorney. One day he and his wife had gone down to the plaza to buy ice cream cones. The air was full of laughter, the sidewalks packed with families and lovers promenading, the air sagging with the scent of flowers. Two men walked up, shot him dead, strolled down the block and climbed into a taxi. No one got a good look at them. The taxi driver had no memory of where he took them. The widow eventually got a job with the Mexican federal police, or <em>federales.</em> Soon she owned nice houses in the capital, on the beach. I would see her at parties laughing, her lips red, her body wrapped in fine garments.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.q">I told myself I did not understand. Now I do. There is a reason to forget.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.r">I&#x2019;ll tell you irrelevant details. If you work in a border factory in Mexico, one most likely owned by an American corporation, you will work four hours and fifty minutes to buy one pound of beef. You will work three hours and nine minutes to buy a half gallon of milk. You will work fifty-five minutes for a bar of soap. You will work over eleven hours to buy your kid a new pair of pants. I&#x2019;ve taught myself to say it is not my problem, to say it does not justify the drug trade, to say it will all work out in the end, just give it a spell. Most days I&#x2019;m a fair hand at saying these things.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.s">You will learn to forget things, too. You will learn things you will always remember. And after the blood dries, you will dance and want and try to get pretty things. And you will know in every cell of your being that nothing that happens to you will ever be known to North Americans sitting in their safe houses with their perfect toilets and their freeze-dried women.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.t"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.u">Calderoni came up in a well-off family, his father a success in the state-owned oil business. He mastered several languages, learned to be a good shot and by the early 1980s was a <em>federale</em> on the border. Soon he was a comandante. He took a million-dollar contract from one drug lord to kill another. (The FBI unknowingly helped him with this murder.) He hobnobbed with DEA agents, helped them out when he needed to and was flown to Washington for a personal tour of the inner sanctum of DEA intelligence. In the 1988 presidential election, he allegedly arranged the murders of key leaders of the opposition party and rigged the computers so that the ruling party&#x2019;s candidate, a man who almost certainly lost the popular vote, won the official vote. In 1992 he got in trouble and fled to the United States, across the Rio Grande. His official wealth was listed at about $7 million. While DEA protected him, it also knew he had more than a billion dollars in stashed assets. He had made his money by killing people. He had made his money by charging a toll to drug traffickers. He had made his money by doing the little dirty tasks commanded by the president of Mexico, Carlos Salinas. He had made his money by knowing how to forget and, of course, when to remember.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.v">Calderoni had thrived while working for the <em>federales,</em> a law team that combines all the virtues of the FBI and the Mafia. I once attended a wedding where drug dealers and <em>federales</em> drank, did drugs, fucked and celebrated together for five days. During the party, one <em>federale</em> major and a colleague left for a few hours, murdered two peasants who were smuggling drugs without paying them off, took the load of dope and sold it.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.w">A week later, that <em>federale</em> major was dead. When I asked what had happened to him, I was told &quot;his heart stopped.&quot; It is, of course, not polite to pry. Just as when I drove by the state-police office each day and admired the towering marijuana plants that constituted the front lawn, I did not pry. Just as when I was run off the road by <em>federales</em> and had an AK-47 poked in my guts, I did not lose my civility.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.x">But now, I think, I&#x2019;ll lose it.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.y">You are holding this magazine, and you think, if you are a sane American, what does this obscure, dead comandante, Guillermo Calderoni, have to do with me? I&#x2019;ll tell you. He was a captain in an industry&#x2014;the global dope business&#x2014;that earns close to half a <em>trillion</em> dollars a year. He was an enforcer that made Mexico safe for your vacations and for your investments in factories where people work for next to nothing. Even if you don&#x2019;t have shares in some U.S. company with factories down in Mexico, you still get your slice of the pie every time you pick up some deal on a television or a VCR or thousands of other items made by people living in cardboard shacks all along the line.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.z">I once was talking to a Mexican woman in her twenties whose sister had been kidnapped, raped and murdered on the border. I asked, &quot;Just what did your sister do?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.10">She looked at me with cold eyes and said, &quot;She made things for you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.11">I keep going to Mexico, God knows why. Partly, I like the people. But mainly, things exist south of that river, on the other side of that fence. Big things, bloody things. Oh God, I love the ladies and the scent coming off their skin, the way they move in stiletto heels, nimble as goats. The beer&#x2019;s good, too, and I can&#x2019;t say enough about the beaches.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.12">This other business, well, best not to talk about it. I&#x2019;m sure that&#x2019;s what the Comandante would advise me if he were still around.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.13"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.14">By the mid-&#x2019;80S, a legend had begun to trail Calderoni, one that struck awe in American FBI and DEA agents and terror in Mexican citizens. Rumors had spread that he interrogated with a bolt cutter or with pliers on the teeth. He became the guy who was sent in to clean up the various Dodge Citys of Mexico. When a drug leader in Ju&amp;#xE1;rez roughed up an American newspaper photographer in 1986 and the U.S. press demanded justice, Calderoni was the one who made it right. He did several things. He told the previous comandante in Ju&amp;#xE1;rez that he had twenty-four hours to get out of town. Then he went to the mansion of the offending drug leader&#x2014;getting past his pet tiger, alligators and boa constrictors&#x2014;and hauled the guy and his pistoleros off to prison. Then, as a separate venture, he flew through U.S. territory&#x2014;escorted by FBI agents in American helicopters&#x2014;to a small Mexican town near Ojinaga, Chihuahua, and killed Pablo Acosta, at that moment the major conduit of Colombian cocaine through Mexico into the United States. (The FBI was unaware that this was actually a contract killing for which Calderoni was paid $1 million.) Acosta&#x2019;s mistake was being featured in the press; he&#x2019;d given a front-page interview to an El Paso daily detailing his bribe payments to the Mexican government. This fame made him expendable. The FBI was so hungry for a headline blow against a major drug dealer that it kept its scheme with Calderoni a secret from DEA.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.15">But to its consternation, the FBI also kept hearing of a different Calderoni from its snitches, information that the bureau buried in its files&#x2014;in part because Calderoni was the kind of connection who could make a narc&#x2019;s career, a man who could hand over the big case all wrapped up in a ribbon with a bow, and in part because the FBI could not believe the truth, because it meant its Mexico was not the <em>real</em> Mexico, just as successive American administrations have ignored reports linking the Mexican president and the country&#x2019;s ruling class to the drug business. Just as the brother of one president of Mexico funneled roughly $100 million in drug money through one U.S. bank without anyone saying a word in the regulatory agencies. The U.S. government knows very little about Mexicans. Except, of course, that they continue to flee the country the U.S. government helps to sustain.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.16"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.17">In 1996, Calderoni mysteriously erupted in a huge story in <em>The New York Times</em>, complete with a photo of him and President Carlos Salinas. The story explained that Calderoni&#x2019;s earlier warnings to the American government of links between Mexico&#x2019;s $30-billion-a-year drug world and the Salinas administration had been ignored lest they upset international relationships and trade deals. The Comandante, in this singular newspaper appearance, made his point: <em>I know, and if I&#x2019;m bothered, I will remember what I know</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.18">Then the Comandante vanished from public notice and became a man left to his golf game in Texas. For years I heard rumors that he had not truly retired, that he retained his network in Mexico, that he continued to help in contract killings and other housekeeping matters. When I would mention these rumors to people in DEA, I&#x2019;d receive a shrug and silence.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.19">The agency wanted to forget what it really knew about Calderoni&#x2014;about how, back in the &#x2019;80s, when shipments of cocaine began to flood Mexico, the Comandante had prospered, and as he rose, so did his share of the action. During the Salinas years, an effort by U.S. operatives to pin down the Comandante&#x2019;s assets stalled when they reached $1 billion. And here the unreality returns as it always does in Mexico: a billion dollars flowing into the hands of a man who lived and died largely unknown to the American press and government. The Comandante prospered in this world of ignorance. He would work with DEA, seize loads left and right and do this because a part of him wanted to be a supercop. And then the Comandante would blame the seizures on DEA, even when the agency had nothing to do with them. DEA made busts, got headlines and had a valiant antidrug Comandante to celebrate. The billion dollars stashed away? A detail.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.1a">&quot;DEA never looked for Calderoni&#x2019;s money,&quot; a retired U.S. government agent told me. &quot;DEA was in love with him.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.1b">Retired to his mansion in McAllen, Calderoni continued to do what he had always done. He sold intelligence. He consulted with traffickers on how to bring drugs into the United States. He blackmailed leading Mexican politicians with his tapes. He flourished as if the flight from his police post and nation had never occurred.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.1d">The church is modern, sterile, and reeks of a germproof United States, a fortress built to block the aromas drifting across the border. People come from Mexico for the Comandante&#x2019;s funeral, and St. Joseph the Worker in McAllen is packed. Retired DEA agents show up, along with many other people who do not advertise who or what they are. In death, it seems, the Comandante is finally safe to visit. One former DEA agent tells the press that the Comandante never took dirty money or played both sides against the other. Or did murder for hire. Which is only more evidence of the fantasy history peculiar to the war on drugs.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.1f">I like to imagine the world of Comandante Calderoni: doing deep deals with the FBI and DEA and most likely the CIA; arresting, killing and charging multibillion-dollar drug cartels; carrying out the crimes and desires of the leaders of Mexico; and betraying all of them to each other and somehow keeping his footing, never spinning out of control, never flinching as one thing led to another. Living in McAllen, playing golf right there on the banks of the Rio Grande, where he faced a nation of harsh and corrupt power that wanted to jail him, as well as large organizations of cutthroats whom he had beaten, tortured, arrested and of course charged generously for the experience.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.1g">Now he becomes ash and dust, becomes a footnote in a few American newspapers, becomes a file sealed in various agencies. His tracks across Mexican history and our own history are at this very moment blowing away in the wind.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.1h">Time to open a cold beer, maybe head down to the playas. Mexico can be really colorful. Hell, you can&#x2019;t believe the parties&#x2014;they go on for days. The water can be risky, some say, but you can bank on the beer and the women.</p><p data-reactid=".227oraj45j4.1.1.0.0.4.1i"><a href="../contributors/charles-bowden"><strong>Charles Bowden</strong></a><em> is a </em><strong>GQ</strong><em> writer at large.
