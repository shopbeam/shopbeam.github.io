  	    "articleBody": "The \u0022Bad Lip Reading\u0022 videos are never kind to the politicians they lampoon, but the  one devoted to the August 6 Republican presidential debate is especially brutal to one pol in particular: Ben Carson. In it, the pediatric neurosurgeon turned presidential candidate is portrayed as a soft-spoken, sleepy-seeming simpleton—one half Gary from Veep, the other half Lennie from Of Mice and Men. \u0022Bad Lip Reading,\u0022 of course, is satire, but the actual political pundits were no less harsh in their assessments of Carson\u0027s performance in the immediate aftermath of the debate. John Heilemann  wrote that \u0022every time the good doctor opened his mouth, the energy level on stage palpably plummeted; his affect was less appealingly low-key than somnolent.\u0022 Although Carson had the  fifth most airtime of the 10 candidates on the stage, Jonathan Capehart nonetheless  deemed him \u0022the invisible man.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd yet, nearly a month after that debate, it\u0027s now clear that Carson was among its biggest winners. In late July, he was polling at around 6 percent and falling—so much so that David Graham  argued Carson was the biggest victim of Donald Trump\u0027s rise. But since the debate, Carson has surged. Last week, a national Quinnipiac poll had him in second place behind Trump. This week, a  Monmouth poll found Trump and Carson tied for first in Iowa.\u000A\u000AWhat explains Carson\u0027s rise—and the fact that so few pundits saw it coming? Part of the answer is that Carson\u0027s pitch has always puzzled pundits, who are right (and maybe even charitable) to call it  \u0022low energy.\u0022 His political speeches are not only not very political; they\u0027re often devoid of obvious applause lines or anything that could be described, even vaguely, as red meat. Carson relies heavily on his biography—telling of his remarkable rise from an impoverished childhood to become one of the world\u0027s most successful doctors—and frequently offers vague platitudes rather than specific policies. But still, what strikes pundits as sleepy and canned is obviously striking a chord with Republican primary voters, who seem to see in Carson the flipside of Trump: another non-politician, but a nice one.\u000A\u000ABut there\u0027s a second reason Carson is rising in the polls. He has become a much better, more disciplined candidate. Carson broke onto the national political scene in the most bombastic way possible: By  denouncing Barack Obama to his face during the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013. He followed up that performance by  likening Obamacare to slavery and arguing that the United States today is akin to Nazi Germany. This was the Carson I encountered when I spent a significant amount of time with him—in Washington, Iowa, and Israel—earlier this year; the  profile that resulted was not especially glowing. In the piece, Carson likened President Obama to a psychopath; revealed a good degree of ignorance about the Israeli government; and mistakenly referred to Alan Greenspan as a former Treasury Secretary. \u0022He was devastated by the GQ piece,\u0022 Armstrong Williams, Carson\u0027s business manager, told me this week. But the story also apparently prompted some introspection. \u0022It was a changing of the guard for him in terms of discipline and substance,\u0022 Williams says. \u0022He took ownership for what he saw as the flaws in himself. For him, there are no more gaffes now, so people really get a chance to hear his message.\u0022\u000A\u000AGranted, Carson still says controversial things. Just last week, for instance, he  called for drone strikes along the U.S.-Mexican border to deter illegal immigration. But when you compare those comments to what Trump has said about immigration, Carson\u0027s seem positively quaint. As Carson  told Chuck Todd on \u0022Meet the Press\u0022 last month, Trump\u0027s rise has been \u0022a tremendous help. It\u0027s a tremendous aid because fewer people are talking about my lack of political experience now.\u0022 Indeed, although the two men are friendly—they have homes near one another in Florida and Carson even attended Trump\u0027s Super Bowl party earlier this year—Carson\u0027s team believes that their candidate benefits from comparisons to Trump. \u0022There\u0027s such a clear difference between the bombastic approach of Trump and the surgical approach of Dr. Carson,\u0022 argues Williams.  \u0022He\u0027s undisciplined, like Carson once was.\u0022 The result is a best of both worlds scenario for Carson. For the hardcore conservatives who discovered him after the Prayer Breakfast, they\u0027ll always have his \u0022slavery\u0022 and \u0022Nazi\u0022 comments; for those other voters just getting to know him now, Carson presents a more friendly face.\u000A\u000AThe question now for Carson is if he can sustain his momentum. The predictable answer, of course, is no—that like Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann last election, or (presumably) Trump this time around, he will inevitably falter. But there\u0027s something about Carson\u0027s rise that might mitigate against such an outcome. Unlike Cain and Bachman, who burned brightly before flaming out, and Trump, whose detractors are just as passionate as his supporters, Carson\u0027s rise has been so slow and steady—and so sleepy—that it\u0027s hard to imagine a scenario in which he implodes. Yes, if he remains at the top of the polls, he will receive more scrutiny, both from the press and his opponents, which is sure to take a toll. But Carson has built up such an enormous reservoir of goodwill among Republicans—a recent Iowa poll found his favorability rating at a  remarkable 81 percent—that it will take more than that to bring him down.\u000A\u000AIt wasn\u0027t so long ago that the notion of Carson being in the top tier of GOP candidates was absurd. Now that he\u0027s there, is it any more absurd to think that he might actually stick around for a while? Yes, it probably is. But it wouldn\u0027t be the first time the pundits have been wrong about him.\u000A\u000AJason Zengerle is GQ\u0027s Political Correspondent",

John Heilemann  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-07/the-5-most-important-takeaways-from-the-first-debate-of-2016">wrote</a> that &quot;every time the good doctor opened his mouth, the energy level on stage palpably plummeted; his affect was less appealingly low-key than somnolent.&quot; Although Carson had the  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/live/republican-debate-election-2016-cleveland/trump-capitalizes-on-opportunties-to-speak">fifth most airtime</a> of the 10 candidates on the stage, Jonathan Capehart nonetheless  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/07/52-things-i-learned-watching-the-republican-debate/">deemed</a> him &quot;the invisible man.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".mis4yg9p8g.1.1.0.0.4.1">And yet, nearly a month after that debate, it&apos;s now clear that Carson was among its biggest winners. In late July, he was polling at around 6 percent and falling&#x2014;so much so that David Graham  <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/what-happened-to-ben-carson/399794/">argued</a> Carson was the biggest victim of Donald Trump&apos;s rise. But since the debate, Carson has surged. Last week, a national <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/us/us08272015_Ueg38d.pdf">Quinnipiac poll</a> had him in second place behind Trump. This week, a  <a href="http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/85775b52-ec99-4ad3-bbee-14826bdf86e5.pdf">Monmouth poll</a> found Trump and Carson tied for first in Iowa.</p><p data-reactid=".mis4yg9p8g.1.1.0.0.4.2">What explains Carson&apos;s rise&#x2014;and the fact that so few pundits saw it coming? Part of the answer is that Carson&apos;s pitch has always puzzled pundits, who are right (and maybe even charitable) to call it  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/08/31/what-explains-the-rise-of-ben-carson-in-the-age-of-trump/">&quot;low energy.&quot;</a> His political speeches are not only not very political; they&apos;re often devoid of obvious applause lines or anything that could be described, even vaguely, as red meat. Carson relies heavily on his biography&#x2014;telling of his remarkable rise from an impoverished childhood to become one of the world&apos;s most successful doctors&#x2014;and frequently offers vague platitudes rather than specific policies. But still, what strikes pundits as sleepy and canned is obviously striking a chord with Republican primary voters, who seem to see in Carson the flipside of Trump: another non-politician, but a nice one.</p><p data-reactid=".mis4yg9p8g.1.1.0.0.4.3">But there&apos;s a second reason Carson is rising in the polls. He has become a much better, more disciplined candidate. Carson broke onto the national political scene in the most bombastic way possible: By  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpiryahOspY">denouncing Barack Obama to his face</a> during the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013. He followed up that performance by  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/10/11/ben-carson-obamacare-worst-thing-since-slavery/">likening Obamacare to slavery</a> and arguing that the United States today is <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/12/ben-carson-americas-now-very-much-nazi-germany/">akin to Nazi Germany</a>. This was the Carson I encountered when I spent a significant amount of time with him&#x2014;in Washington, Iowa, and Israel&#x2014;earlier this year; the  <a href="ben-carson-tea-party">profile</a> that resulted was not especially glowing. In the piece, Carson likened President Obama to a psychopath; revealed a good degree of ignorance about the Israeli government; and mistakenly referred to Alan Greenspan as a former Treasury Secretary. &quot;He was devastated by the GQ piece,&quot; Armstrong Williams, Carson&apos;s business manager, told me this week. But the story also apparently prompted some introspection. &quot;It was a changing of the guard for him in terms of discipline and substance,&quot; Williams says. &quot;He took ownership for what he saw as the flaws in himself. For him, there are no more gaffes now, so people really get a chance to hear his message.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".mis4yg9p8g.1.1.0.0.4.5">Granted, Carson still says controversial things. Just last week, for instance, he  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/23/politics/ben-carson-evangelicals-trump/">called for drone strikes</a> along the U.S.-Mexican border to deter illegal immigration. But when you compare those comments to what Trump has said about immigration, Carson&apos;s seem positively quaint. As Carson  <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-august-2-2015-n402571">told</a> Chuck Todd on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; last month, Trump&apos;s rise has been &quot;a tremendous help. It&apos;s a tremendous aid because fewer people are talking about my lack of political experience now.&quot; Indeed, although the two men are friendly&#x2014;they have homes near one another in Florida and Carson even attended Trump&apos;s Super Bowl party earlier this year&#x2014;Carson&apos;s team believes that their candidate benefits from comparisons to Trump. &quot;There&apos;s such a clear difference between the bombastic approach of Trump and the surgical approach of Dr. Carson,&quot; argues Williams.  &quot;He&apos;s undisciplined, like Carson once was.&quot; The result is a best of both worlds scenario for Carson. For the hardcore conservatives who discovered him after the Prayer Breakfast, they&apos;ll always have his &quot;slavery&quot; and &quot;Nazi&quot; comments; for those other voters just getting to know him now, Carson presents a more friendly face.</p><p data-reactid=".mis4yg9p8g.1.1.0.0.4.6">The question now for Carson is if he can sustain his momentum. The predictable answer, of course, is no&#x2014;that like Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann last election, or (presumably) Trump this time around, he will inevitably falter. But there&apos;s something about Carson&apos;s rise that might mitigate against such an outcome. Unlike Cain and Bachman, who burned brightly before flaming out, and Trump, whose detractors are just as passionate as his supporters, Carson&apos;s rise has been so slow and steady&#x2014;and so sleepy&#x2014;that it&apos;s hard to imagine a scenario in which he implodes. Yes, if he remains at the top of the polls, he will receive more scrutiny, both from the press and his opponents, which is sure to take a toll. But Carson has built up such an enormous reservoir of goodwill among Republicans&#x2014;a recent Iowa poll found his favorability rating at a  <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/iowa-poll-2016-ben-carson-donald-trump-213182">remarkable 81 percent</a>&#x2014;that it will take more than that to bring him down.</p><p data-reactid=".mis4yg9p8g.1.1.0.0.4.7">It wasn&apos;t so long ago that the notion of Carson being in the top tier of GOP candidates was absurd. Now that he&apos;s there, is it any more absurd to think that he might actually stick around for a while? Yes, it probably is. But it wouldn&apos;t be the first time the pundits have been wrong about him.</p><p data-reactid=".mis4yg9p8g.1.1.0.0.4.8">Jason Zengerle is GQ&apos;s Political Correspondent</p></div><div
