  	    "articleBody": "Okay, so it\u0027s a rave. But it\u0027s in the morning. And it\u0027s dry. You can have all the vegan almond balls you want—for free—but if you want a martini, you\u0027re out of luck. Also, sometimes they have spoken-word poetry. And yoga. I know what you\u0027re thinking: This is really A Thing? You\u0027re lying. This sounds like something people say is A Thing but is not actually A Thing. I didn\u0027t believe it either, but my editor was like, \u0022Go see if this is A Thing.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo I did. I went to a handful of morning raves (or \u0022awakenings\u0022) presented by a collective known as Daybreaker, and you know what? It\u0027s definitely A Thing. There really are people who want to dance around sober with a bunch of strangers in order to get energized for the coming day—hedonism repackaged as a health fad. \u0022It\u0027s a little bit subversive in the sense that it\u0027s a full-on party, and yet there\u0027s no vices,\u0022 Daybreaker co-founder Matthew Brimer explained to me. \u0022So you can tell your grandma about it, and that\u0027s sort of cool, right?\u0022\u000A\u000AMorning raves have become so much of A Thing that Daybreaker has a competitor—a London-based outfit called Morning Gloryville—and parties are now popping up all over North America, Europe, South America, and the Middle East. Are you one of those people who feel the need to get in early on Things, before they blow up and everyone moves on to the Next Thing? Then let me explain how all this works.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re gonna get up really fucking early.\u000A\u000AI went to three Daybreaker parties: one in New York City, one in Los Angeles, one in Austin. Two of them started at 6 A.M., which is way too early for sincerity. This particular New York party took place on a touring boat (no escape!), and I had to get up at 5:15 A.M.—in February—and freeze my ass off walking over to Pier 40 on Manhattan\u0027s far West Side. The only people who should be pushing out to sea this early are Navy Seals.\u000A\u000AYou may want to dress like an animal.\u000A\u000AOn the gangplank, guests began shedding their outerwear to reveal party getups. I wore jeans and a shirt, because there was no guidebook to dressing yourself for a morning rave, but I quickly witnessed the range of options: onesies, leg muffs, platform sneakers, gold-sequined suits, mandals, green velvet robes (worn by a white dude named Dashiki), boots covered in orange electrical tape, shiny genie pants, and workout clothes.\u000A\u000AAt one point during our voyage, I asked one of the organizers if I could be introduced to Brimer.\u000A\u000A\u0022Matt? He\u0027s around. He\u0027s wearing a sheep.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Does his sheep outfit have, like, a hood?\u0022 I asked.\u000A\u000A\u0022Uhhh, there might be more than one sheep guy.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou will get free juice!\u000A\u000AIf you\u0027re picturing a bunch of drunks and Molly-poppers who are simply extending their night out, you\u0027ve got this crowd all wrong. All of the Daybreaker-ers I talked to adhered to the spirit of the event and came here to start their day. They were sober, if maybe a touch hungover. (Though one dude admitted to me, \u0022Well, I did sneak some champagne into my Pellegrino.…\u0022) At each Daybreaker party, I made sure to get really drunk the night before so that I was hung-over. My goal was to see if I could purge my body of toxins through the power of DANCE.\u000A\u000AAnd the power of organic juices. Your $20-to-$40 Daybreaker ticket won\u0027t get you any free beers, but thanks to the event\u0027s sponsors, it does grant you unlimited access to a smorgasbord of cold coffee shots, Kind bars, kombucha, Fair Trade cacao nibs, coconut water, and green smoothies. I was tempted to steal all the salted-caramel bars and stock my pantry with them. Those things aren\u0027t cheap.\u000A\u000A…and free haiku!\u000A\u000AIn the main cabin, the crowd gradually amassed on the dance floor as our DJ, The Scumfrog, fired up beats (a couple of Burning Man devotees came here specifically for him; gotta have that Scumfrog), and random girls started doing that Stevie Nicks thing where you wave your hands around like you\u0027re casting a spell.\u000A\u000AScumfrog was not the only performer. There was also an artist named The Love Child who painted abstract shapes. In Los Angeles, there was a \u0022light painter\u0022 who strobed a bunch of little light diodes around me, asked me my favorite color (red!), and then \u0022painted\u0022 my picture using an iPad.\u000A\u000AAnd in New York, there was the free-haiku station. This really existed. Beside the dance floor, I saw a nattily dressed man banging away on an old typewriter at a table with a sign that read free haiku. There was a line of people waiting.\u000A\u000AWell, I\u0027m no dummy. I got right in that line and waited patiently for my haiku. I could see the man, Daniel, really putting his heart into the composition. Whenever he had a good idea, he would smile, nod, and then begin typing furiously. I saw him hand a haiku to the girl ahead of me, and she stood there in front of Daniel and read it to herself. This seemed like an important part of the ritual: You had to read the haiku in front of the haiku dude so that he could see if his haiku pleased you. The girl looked up, smiled, and said: \u0022Perfect.\u0022\u000A\u000AI was next. Daniel needed a theme for my haiku, so I pulled one out of my ass: THE SUN. He did all the air counting and furious nodding, and then he handed me my poem:\u000A\u000Acracks the glass of cloudseliminating shadowsshine back from earth, son\u000A\u000ASure, okay. That sounds like a haiku about the sun.\u000A\u000ALater, out on the deck, I asked one of Daniel\u0027s friends about his job (is that a job?) writing haiku for people. \u0022He\u0027s just that kind of a guy,\u0022 the friend said. \u0022He\u0027s a pro haiku-er. He\u0027s one of those very Brooklyn-type buds.\u0022\u000A\u000AWe stood and watched the sun rise as the Daybreaker-ers cheered its arrival. I understood why they were so jazzed: How often do you get to see a full sunrise? And how often do you see happy people—outside, in the morning—in New York?\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AYou will not meet a single asshole!\u000A\u000AThere are no hostile bouncers at Daybreaker. There are no roped-off VIP sections. No having to blow a dude to get on the guest list. No one is too cool to be here, because it\u0027s already deeply uncool to dance sober on a boat at 6 A.M. The raves are conceived to be open and welcoming to all. Matthew Brimer (the sheep) and his co-founder, Radha Agrawal (cheetah-print leg warmers), came up with the idea because they were both preternaturally positive human beings—he\u0027s from St. Louis and she\u0027s from Canada; not a trace of irony between them—who were sick of traditional nightclub horseshit.\u000A\u000A\u0022I went to a nightclub last weekend,\u0022 Radha told me, \u0022just because I hadn\u0027t been to one in a while, and it was, like, a bunch of sad tweakers in the dark.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AYou gotta really like dancing.\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t know about you, but I can barely dance sober. It\u0027s also hard to dance by yourself when you\u0027re a guy. A woman dancing alone is a winning lottery ticket; a man dancing alone is mentally ill. No one wants to look like a fool, even though the truth is that you can never dance wrong so long as you\u0027re trying.\u000A\u000ASo I tried. Sunlight was penetrating the boat\u0027s interior as we cruised past Liberty Island, and I found myself doing that thing where you walk to the edge of the dance floor and kinda half-dance to see if the beat sweeps you away. Eventually, I managed to meld into the throng. Closing my eyes helped. A conga line formed. People started taking selfies with one another. Bare shoulders glistened with fresh sweat. Guys took off their shirts and pajamas. (It gets hot dancing in footies.) One dude busted out a drum, which I completely expected to happen. The whole joint looked like stock footage from a T-Mobile ad. Two guys dressed as vegetables—one a zucchini, the other a Brussels sprout—suddenly appeared on the dance floor to great cheers.\u000A\u000AThen someone handed me a metal pole with a glowing jellyfish perched at the top. I was now the Jellyfish King. I danced around with the jellyfish and poked the air with it until my arms got tired and I scoured feverishly for someone to pass the jellyfish to. Will someone please take this goddamn jellyfish?\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AYou, Mr. Cynic, are not welcome here.\u000A\u000ANow, I know this all sounds like New Agey hipster bullshit. I heard the word intentionality more than once, and I also met my fair share of yoga instructors, like Kylie from Australia, who said stuff like: \u0022I call it, like, the New Paradigm. There\u0027s, like, a massive consciousness shift, and people are exploring levels of awareness and attention that are essentially uncharted.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re probably rolling your eyes at that, but here\u0027s the thing: No one at a Daybreaker party will care. The 6 A.M. start time weeds out the cynics and the lechers and the rubberneckers. \u0022You can\u0027t accidentally go to Daybreaker,\u0022 Matthew told me. Only a certain type of person musters up the effort to go to one of these things. And once you get there, you will be in a safe haven where not a single person finds this whole idea absurd.\u000A\u000AOn my way out of the party in Los Angeles, I asked a girl named Francine if she was heading to work. \u0022No,\u0022 she said. \u0022I\u0027m gonna goof off, eat breakfast, play on the beach, maybe Hula-Hoop.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou do feel kinda refreshed!\u000A\u000ASo now comes the inevitable part in this big fake-trend piece where I tell you that this trend isn\u0027t quite so goofy once you try it. You know how these things go. Once the parties in New York and L.A. and Austin wrapped up, I walked out feeling genuinely energized. I was ready to grab the day by the nutsack. The sunlight didn\u0027t feel like an attack on my feeble brain.\u000A\u000AAnd if Daybreaker\u0027s organizers have their way, we will all start our mornings with vegan pumpkin bread and two hours of EDM. Matthew and Radha plan to expand to more cities, like Amsterdam, Hong Kong, and Berlin. And they plan on staging sober dance parties at night. (Partying at night? That\u0027s crazy!) They have also gotten Daybreaker into schools, as part of a dance-education initiative. You cannot escape morning-rave culture. The rhythm is going to get you.\u000A\u000ABut not me. I had a nice time, but 6 A.M. is still way too early, man. I need sleep and bacon.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AMorning Raves vs. Night Raves: A Primer\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMorning• Happy Russians• Bear suits• People going to the bathroom to go to the bathroom• No lines• Hugging• Kale dealers• Babies\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ANight• Angry Russians• Bears• People going to the bathroom for blow and unhygienic sex• So many lines• Grinding• Drug dealers• Pacifiers\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADrew Magary is a GQ correspondent and a staff writer for Deadspin.",

But it&apos;s in the morning. And it&apos;s <em>dry.</em> You can have all the vegan almond balls you want&#x2014;for free&#x2014;but if you want a martini, you&apos;re out of luck. Also, sometimes they have spoken-word poetry. And yoga. I know what you&apos;re thinking: <em>This is really A Thing? You&apos;re lying. This sounds like something people say is A Thing but is not actually A Thing.</em> I didn&apos;t believe it either, but my editor was like, &#x201C;Go see if this is A Thing.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.1">So I did. I went to a handful of morning raves (or &#x201C;awakenings&#x201D;) presented by a collective known as Daybreaker, and you know what? It&apos;s definitely A Thing. There really are people who want to dance around sober with a bunch of strangers in order to get energized for the coming day&#x2014;hedonism repackaged as a health fad. &#x201C;It&apos;s a little bit subversive in the sense that it&apos;s a full-on party, and yet there&apos;s no vices,&#x201D; Daybreaker co-founder Matthew Brimer explained to me. &#x201C;So you can tell your grandma about it, and that&apos;s sort of cool, right?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.2">Morning raves have become so much of A Thing that Daybreaker has a <em>competitor</em>&#x2014;a London-based outfit called Morning Gloryville&#x2014;and parties are now popping up all over North America, Europe, South America, and the Middle East. Are you one of those people who feel the need to get in early on Things, before they blow up and everyone moves on to the Next Thing? Then let me explain how all this works.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.3"><hr></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.5"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55b90a65624390b349811d0f/master/w_600/morning-ravers-gg-2015-02.jpg" alt="morning-ravers-gg-2015-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;t=morning-ravers-gg-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;t=morning-ravers-gg-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b90a65624390b349811d0f%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmorning-ravers-gg-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=morning-ravers-gg-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b90a65624390b349811d0f%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmorning-ravers-gg-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=morning-ravers-gg-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.6"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55b90a65962900e47cf12f2a/master/w_600/morning-ravers-gg-2015-04.jpg" alt="morning-ravers-gg-2015-04.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;t=morning-ravers-gg-2015-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;t=morning-ravers-gg-2015-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b90a65962900e47cf12f2a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmorning-ravers-gg-2015-04.jpg&amp;description=morning-ravers-gg-2015-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b90a65962900e47cf12f2a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmorning-ravers-gg-2015-04.jpg&amp;description=morning-ravers-gg-2015-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.7"><hr></div><div class="embed ul" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.8"><ul><li><strong>You&apos;re gonna get up really fucking early.</strong></li></ul></div><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.9">I went to three Daybreaker parties: one in New York City, one in Los Angeles, one in Austin. Two of them started at 6 A.M., which is <em>way</em> too early for sincerity. This particular New York party took place on a touring boat (no escape!), and I had to get up at 5:15 A.M.&#x2014;in February&#x2014;and freeze my ass off walking over to Pier 40 on Manhattan&apos;s far West Side. The only people who should be pushing out to sea this early are Navy Seals.</p><div class="embed ul" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.a"><ul><li><strong>You may want to dress like an animal.</strong></li></ul></div><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.b">On the gangplank, guests began shedding their outerwear to reveal party getups. I wore jeans and a shirt, because there was no guidebook to dressing yourself for a morning rave, but I quickly witnessed the range of options: onesies, leg muffs, platform sneakers, gold-sequined suits, mandals, green velvet robes (worn by a white dude named Dashiki), boots covered in orange electrical tape, shiny genie pants, and workout clothes.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.c">At one point during our voyage, I asked one of the organizers if I could be introduced to Brimer.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.d">&#x201C;Matt? He&apos;s around. He&apos;s wearing a sheep.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.e">&#x201C;Does his sheep outfit have, like, a hood?&#x201D; I asked.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.f">&#x201C;Uhhh, there might be more than one sheep guy.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed ul" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.g"><ul><li><strong>You will get free juice!</strong></li></ul></div><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.h">If you&apos;re picturing a bunch of drunks and Molly-poppers who are simply extending their night out, you&apos;ve got this crowd all wrong. All of the Daybreaker-ers I talked to adhered to the spirit of the event and came here to start their day. They were sober, if maybe a touch hungover. (Though one dude admitted to me, &#x201C;Well, I <em>did</em> sneak some champagne into my Pellegrino.&#x2026;&#x201D;) At each Daybreaker party, I made sure to get really drunk the night before so that I was hung-over. My goal was to see if I could purge my body of toxins through the power of DANCE.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.i">And the power of organic juices. Your $20-to-$40 Daybreaker ticket won&apos;t get you any free beers, but thanks to the event&apos;s sponsors, it does grant you unlimited access to a smorgasbord of cold coffee shots, Kind bars, kombucha, Fair Trade cacao nibs, coconut water, and green smoothies. I was tempted to steal all the salted-caramel bars and stock my pantry with them. Those things aren&apos;t cheap.</p><div class="embed ul" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.j"><ul><li><strong>&#x2026;<em>and</em> free haiku!</strong></li></ul></div><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.k">In the main cabin, the crowd gradually amassed on the dance floor as our DJ, The Scumfrog, fired up beats (a couple of Burning Man devotees came here specifically for him; gotta have that Scumfrog), and random girls started doing that Stevie Nicks thing where you wave your hands around like you&apos;re casting a spell.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.l">Scumfrog was not the only performer. There was also an artist named The Love Child who painted abstract shapes. In Los Angeles, there was a &#x201C;light painter&#x201D; who strobed a bunch of little light diodes around me, asked me my favorite color (red!), and then &#x201C;painted&#x201D; my picture using an iPad.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.m">And in New York, there was the free-haiku station. This really existed. Beside the dance floor, I saw a nattily dressed man banging away on an old typewriter at a table with a sign that read free haiku. There was a line of people waiting.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.n">Well, I&apos;m no dummy. I got right in that line and waited patiently for my haiku. I could see the man, Daniel, really putting his heart into the composition. Whenever he had a good idea, he would smile, nod, and then begin typing furiously. I saw him hand a haiku to the girl ahead of me, and she stood there in front of Daniel and read it to herself. This seemed like an important part of the ritual: You had to read the haiku in front of the haiku dude so that he could see if his haiku pleased you. The girl looked up, smiled, and said: &#x201C;Perfect.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.o">I was next. Daniel needed a theme for my haiku, so I pulled one out of my ass: THE SUN. He did all the air counting and furious nodding, and then he handed me my poem:</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.p"><em>cracks the glass of clouds<br>eliminating shadows<br>shine back from earth, son</em></p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.q">Sure, okay. That sounds like a haiku about the sun.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.r">Later, out on the deck, I asked one of Daniel&apos;s friends about his job (is that a job?) writing haiku for people. &#x201C;He&apos;s just that kind of a guy,&#x201D; the friend said. &#x201C;He&apos;s a pro haiku-er.

There are no roped-off VIP sections. No having to blow a dude to get on the guest list. No one is too cool to be here, because it&apos;s already deeply uncool to dance sober on a boat at 6 A.M. The raves are conceived to be open and welcoming to all. Matthew Brimer (the sheep) and his co-founder, Radha Agrawal (cheetah-print leg warmers), came up with the idea because they were both preternaturally positive human beings&#x2014;he&apos;s from St. Louis and she&apos;s from Canada; not a trace of irony between them&#x2014;who were sick of traditional nightclub horseshit.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.y">&#x201C;I went to a nightclub last weekend,&#x201D; Radha told me, &#x201C;just because I hadn&apos;t been to one in a while, and it was, like, a bunch of sad tweakers in the dark.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.z"><hr></div><div class="embed ul" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.10"><ul><li><strong>You gotta really like dancing.</strong></li></ul></div><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.11">I don&apos;t know about you, but I can barely dance sober. It&apos;s also hard to dance by yourself when you&apos;re a guy. A woman dancing alone is a winning lottery ticket; a man dancing alone is mentally ill. No one wants to look like a fool, even though the truth is that you can never dance wrong so long as you&apos;re trying.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.12">So I tried. Sunlight was penetrating the boat&apos;s interior as we cruised past Liberty Island, and I found myself doing that thing where you walk to the edge of the dance floor and kinda half-dance to see if the beat sweeps you away. Eventually, I managed to meld into the throng. Closing my eyes helped. A conga line formed. People started taking selfies with one another. Bare shoulders glistened with fresh sweat. Guys took off their shirts and pajamas. (It gets hot dancing in footies.) One dude busted out a drum, which I <em>completely</em> expected to happen. The whole joint looked like stock footage from a T-Mobile ad. Two guys dressed as vegetables&#x2014;one a zucchini, the other a Brussels sprout&#x2014;suddenly appeared on the dance floor to great cheers.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.13">Then someone handed me a metal pole with a glowing jellyfish perched at the top. I was now the Jellyfish King. I danced around with the jellyfish and poked the air with it until my arms got tired and I scoured feverishly for someone to pass the jellyfish to. <em>Will someone please take this goddamn jellyfish?</em></p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.14"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55b90a66b6a585c04cb5ac83/master/w_600/morning-ravers-gg-2015-06.jpg" alt="morning-ravers-gg-2015-06.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;t=morning-ravers-gg-2015-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;t=morning-ravers-gg-2015-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b90a66b6a585c04cb5ac83%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmorning-ravers-gg-2015-06.jpg&amp;description=morning-ravers-gg-2015-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b90a66b6a585c04cb5ac83%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmorning-ravers-gg-2015-06.jpg&amp;description=morning-ravers-gg-2015-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.15"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55b90a66624390b349811d13/master/w_600/morning-ravers-gg-2015-07.jpg" alt="morning-ravers-gg-2015-07.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;t=morning-ravers-gg-2015-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;t=morning-ravers-gg-2015-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b90a66624390b349811d13%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmorning-ravers-gg-2015-07.jpg&amp;description=morning-ravers-gg-2015-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmorning-raves&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55b90a66624390b349811d13%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmorning-ravers-gg-2015-07.jpg&amp;description=morning-ravers-gg-2015-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.16"><hr></div><div class="embed ul" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.17"><ul><li><strong>You, Mr. Cynic, are not welcome here.</strong></li></ul></div><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.18">Now, I know this all sounds like New Agey hipster bullshit. I heard the word <em>intentionality</em> more than once, and I also met my fair share of yoga instructors, like Kylie from Australia, who said stuff like: &#x201C;I call it, like, the New Paradigm. There&apos;s, like, a massive consciousness shift, and people are exploring levels of awareness and attention that are essentially uncharted.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.19">You&apos;re probably rolling your eyes at that, but here&apos;s the thing: No one at a Daybreaker party will care. The 6 A.M. start time weeds out the cynics and the lechers and the rubberneckers. &#x201C;You can&apos;t accidentally go to Daybreaker,&#x201D; Matthew told me. Only a certain type of person musters up the effort to go to one of these things. And once you get there, you will be in a safe haven where not a single person finds this whole idea absurd.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.1a">On my way out of the party in Los Angeles, I asked a girl named Francine if she was heading to work. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I&apos;m gonna goof off, eat breakfast, play on the beach, maybe Hula-Hoop.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed ul" data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><ul><li><strong>You <em>do</em> feel kinda refreshed!</strong></li></ul></div><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.1c">So now comes the inevitable part in this big fake-trend piece where I tell you that this trend isn&apos;t quite so goofy once you try it. You know how these things go. Once the parties in New York and L.A. and Austin wrapped up, I walked out feeling genuinely energized. I was ready to grab the day by the nutsack. The sunlight didn&apos;t feel like an attack on my feeble brain.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.1d">And if Daybreaker&apos;s organizers have their way, we will all start our mornings with vegan pumpkin bread and two hours of EDM. Matthew and Radha plan to expand to more cities, like Amsterdam, Hong Kong, and Berlin. And they plan on staging sober dance parties at <em>night.</em> (Partying at night? That&apos;s crazy!) They have also gotten Daybreaker into schools, as part of a dance-education initiative. You cannot escape morning-rave culture. The rhythm <em>is</em> going to get you.</p><p data-reactid=".lrm8xklgqo.1.1.0.0.4.1e">But not me. I had a nice time, but 6 A.M. is still way too early, man.
