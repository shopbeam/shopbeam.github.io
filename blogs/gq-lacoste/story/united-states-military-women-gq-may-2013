They\u0027re a distraction, a threat to cohesion, a provocative tease to close-quartered men. These are the sort of myths you hear from people who oppose the U.S. military\u0027s evolving new rules about women in combat. But for women who have already been in combat, who have earned medals fighting alongside men, the war stories they tell don\u0027t sound a thing like myths\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022I remember hearing the bullets hit the ground beside me and hit my truck behind me. Our squad leader had us sneak around and flank them. From a trench line that overlooked the field, we laid down fire, and I know that I shot, and made fall, three. After twenty minutes, most of the insurgents out in that field were incapacitated, but there were three more still left in the trench line opposite us, about thirty meters away. We knew that the only way we were going to end this is if we took them out. The staff sergeant and myself, we jumped in the trench; our teammate followed us along the top. I was so concentrated that I couldn\u0027t hear the bullets. I didn\u0027t even hear my own rifle. We hugged the wall of the trench on the right side. It kind of jutted out a little bit and gave us cover, but we couldn\u0027t get the right angle to kill them with our rifles. We resorted to throwing grenades. That did the trick. Looking at what was left of them, I felt nothing.  A woman can\u0027t be a killer? I beg the contrary.\u0022\u000A\u000A— Staff Sergeant Leigh Ann Hester, military police, Army National Guard  Ambushed by enemy forces in Salman Pak, eastern Iraq, on March 20, 2005. Awarded a Silver Star, the nation\u0027s third-highest military decoration for valor—the first female recipient since World War II and the first to earn it for close-quarters combat. \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A1. Female Engagement\u000A\u000A\u0022Outside the wire\u0022—beyond the confines of the base—women have regularly seen combat as military police, convoy drivers, medics, combat photographers, interpreters. Some also became members of female engagement teams, or FETs, a detachment created to help fight the war in Afghanistan. Two to three women would be embedded with an infantry unit and would accompany it on foot patrols, over IED-strewn roads, and through ambushes, raids, and firefights. They could do what male soldiers could not: communicate with local Muslim women.\u000A\u000ASergeant Kristen Dombosk, civil affairs, Army \u000AThe way this war in Iraq was fought, there was really no front line. You could get hit just as easily on the base as during a mission. It didn\u0027t matter if you were infantry or not; we went out with infantry all the time. We all had the same equipment, the same combat load, the same types of missions. It was just semantics.\u000A\u000ASergeant Kayla Williams, military intelligence, Army \u000AWomen weren\u0027t assigned to combat-arms units, but we were \u0022attached\u0022 to them as needed. I ended up going on combat patrols with the infantry. Because I was female and because this was Rumsfeld\u0027s \u0022You go to war with the army you have\u0022 phase, I did not have plates for my flak vest. If women aren\u0027t in combat and if you only have so many plates to go around, why would you give them to the women?\u000A\u000ACorporal Sarah Furrer, FET member, Marines \u000AOur mission was to collect information about the village: who was there, what was going on. We also did the hearts-and-minds kind of thing. We\u0027d sit down with these women; we\u0027d take off our Kevlars [helmets]; we\u0027d put down our guns; we\u0027d talk face-to-face and have tea. These people can barely count. They have never seen big, giant American people. We look like robots to them. It becomes very personal.\u000A\u000ASergeant Carolyn Schapper, Army National Guard \u000AThe women in one village told me, \u0022My children are sick because we are not allowed to go to the hospital at night, because you guys have put a curfew here, and you\u0027ve restricted our ability to get fresh water.\u0022 They\u0027re blaming us, not the terrorists who we put that curfew for. These are the things that are extremely important to know.\u000A\u000ASarah Furrer \u000AIt\u0027s very scary, especially if you know you\u0027re in an enemy\u0027s house. There\u0027s a lot of men who would not do that, no way in hell. They know how dangerous it is. But that\u0027s the mission. I would die for it.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestSergeant (Ret.) Chantel Razack\u000A\u000ASergeant Michele Greco-Lucchina, FET member, Marines \u000AHalfway through my deployment, the female engagement team had gotten pulled back to Camp Dwyer because Congress had gotten wind of this. It was apparent that we essentially were performing combat functions, and they basically had to find loopholes for us to stay out there.\u000A\u000ALieutenant General (Ret.) Carol A. Mutter, Marines \u000ACommanders have had to spend time figuring out inventive ways to allow women where they need to be. We needed the combat-exclusion policy to go away, because we have women in combat.\u000A\u000ASergeant (Ret.) Chantel Razack, military police, Army \u000AWe deployed with an infantry company in May. We lived with them; we ate with them; we patrolled with them. In July we had our first casualty. Our platoon leader had his face torn off, and his legs were shredded. I remember standing at the gun, crying while I\u0027m shooting. My platoon daddy is tugging on my pants, because he\u0027s lying in a litter below me. He says, \u0022I can\u0027t feel my legs.\u0022 I looked down and I saw what I saw, and I said, \u0022We\u0027ve got you, sir. We\u0027re getting you home. You\u0027re okay.\u0022 After that hit, we realized what we were in—and both male and female, we held hands, cried. A lot of us broke down. I know, me personally, I didn\u0027t want to talk about it. I just said, \u0022We\u0027re going to go back there and kick some ass.\u0022 We were going to get them back for what they did to ours.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestLieutenant Colonel Kim Campbell\u000A\u000ALieutenant Colonel Kim Campbell, A-10 \u0022Warthog\u0022 attack pilot, Air Force:\u000ASustained fire over the Tigris River in Baghdad on April 7, 2003.\u000A\u000AOn my last pass, as I was coming off target, I felt and heard a large explosion at the back of the aircraft. I completely lost hydraulics. My initial thought was, \u0022If I eject and come down in a parachute right in the middle of the Iraqi Republican Guard, it probably won\u0027t go so well for me.\u0022 Also, allowing that aircraft to crash in the ground just wasn\u0027t something that I wanted to do.\u000A\u000ASo I really only had one option. It\u0027s called manual reversion. It\u0027s our backup system, and it allows us to fly the jet using just cranks and cables. We\u0027d practiced it—once—during our initial training. I flipped the switch, and my jet started climbing out and away from Baghdad. But the jet isn\u0027t designed to land in manual reversion. In Desert Storm, I knew, there had been three manual-reversion landings attempted. In one, the pilot was killed. In another, the jet was destroyed and the pilot was lucky to survive. In the third, the pilot had successfully landed. My gut told me I could land the airplane, and that\u0027s what I chose to do.\u000A\u000AWe have 300 miles to go from Baghdad back to Kuwait, and it\u0027s the longest hour of my life. As I got near the runway, the aircraft started to turn over, but I was able to counteract the roll; it was probably the best landing I\u0027ve ever done. Voices came over the radio: \u0022Welcome home!\u0022 \u0022Great job!\u0022 All the pilots in my squadron went out to the runway to watch me land. The airplane had so many holes that it never flew again.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A2. Never Show Weakness\u000A\u000A Each branch of the armed services maintains separate fitness standards for men and women. \u0022It\u0027s not merely the combat-exclusion policy that has made women into second-class citizens,\u0022 says Mutter, the first female three-star general in the history of the Marines. \u0022The different fitness requirements have done it, too.\u0022 Several women interviewed for this story report scoring a 300—the maximum—on the men\u0027s test. Accomplishing this in the Marines requires the soldier or officer to do twenty pull-ups and one hundred crunches and run three miles in less than eighteen minutes.\u000A\u000AChief Warrant Officer Tania Dunbar, radar-repair technician, Army \u000AI\u0027ve seen females push themselves past the point of injury to prove themselves. They have stress fractures in their hips, and they don\u0027t want anyone to know or to think that they\u0027re weak.\u000A\u000APetty Officer Second Class Elena Woods, hospital corpsman, Navy \u000AWe felt we couldn\u0027t show weakness; we couldn\u0027t complain; we didn\u0027t want to talk about how hot it was or how much we missed home. When you come back from a patrol, all of the guys drop their gear. They complain about how exhausted they are; they complain about how much that patrol sucked. Of course, that was kind of our moment—\u0022It wasn\u0027t that bad\u0022—even though inside we\u0027re probably wanting to die.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestStaff Sergeant Heather Boyd\u000A\u000AStaff Sergeant Heather Boyd, Army \u000AI was definitely pushed to the max, and I have run ultra-marathons. Their SOP was, like, sixteen bottles of water a day plus a radio, plus food for a week, plus whatever, plus your body armor, plus your weapon, plus—oh yeah, it\u0027s December, so you gotta have extra gear, because it\u0027s cold as shit. Physically, I just remember being in so much pain. You want to be that cool Army chick that\u0027s tough and isn\u0027t complaining, but it was very, very difficult for me. I mean, it\u0027s no joke. It is fucking hard.\u000A\u000AElena Woods \u000AA male soldier told me, \u0022You can\u0027t fireman-carry me with a full combat load\u0022—meaning I have my Kevlar on, my flak jacket, my weapon, and my gear. He was probably 190 to 200 pounds; your gear adds another fifty to eighty pounds. I picked him up and walked across the compound, which was probably fifty meters, and came back, and he was like, \u0022But still—would you be able to do that with your adrenaline going?\u0022\u000A\u000A Brigadier General (Ret.)Rhonda Cornum, M.D., flight surgeon, Army \u000AThere are some [jobs] I think it\u0027s very unlikely that many women will want, or be able, to do. I mean, if it really does require you to be able to hump 135 pounds for so many miles at such and such a speed, then I think there\u0027s going to be very few women who can do that. But the fact that there aren\u0027t very many doesn\u0027t mean we should have a law against it.\u000A\u000AA Disaster in Waiting?\u000A\u000AThe end of the combat-exclusion policy will officially open artillery, armor, infantry, and other combat units to women. By May 15, 2013, each of the five branches of the armed services will submit an implementation plan; by January 2016, each will formally request any exceptions. For instance, a branch may ask that particularly demanding specialties—such as Green Berets or Navy Seals—remain all-male. Some of the women interviewed for this article expressed ambivalence about, even outright opposition to, the ban\u0027s lifting.\u000A\u000A Captain Juliann Naughton, convoy commander, Marines \u000AThe major argument for putting women into combat MOSs [military-occupational specialties] is that they have performed in combat already. I agree; I have. But there\u0027s a difference between stepping up when the need arises and having a combat MOS.\u000A\u000A Sergeant Michele Greco-Lucchina\u000A We were brought in because male and female communication in [Afghan] culture is unacceptable. Because only—only—we could do this job. Now, would this have been necessary in the Vietnam era? Let\u0027s go forward twenty-five or thirty years; let\u0027s say we\u0027re at war with Korea. Is it going to be necessary? Possibly not.\u000A\u000A Corporal Darlene Diaz, FET member, Marines \u000AI don\u0027t care what anybody says: Women are wired differently, and the way we cope with things is different. When I was out there, it would break my heart to see these little kids that would get blown up in IEDs, whereas a male Marine just walked right by. We hold on to things like that, which is not going to make you combat-sound when you need to be.\u000A\u000A Sergeant (Ret.) Jolene Raciborski, Army \u000AGeneral Order Number 1: No sex, no drugs, no alcohol. You can be chaptered for that—and there were drugs, there was sex, there was alcohol. It\u0027s to relieve the stress of combat. A girl walks in with boots, a gun, and a nine-mil, men are gonna look at you. It\u0027s just natural. There\u0027s a sergeant who\u0027s having an issue with his wife, he sees an attractive female. He hasn\u0027t touched a woman in twelve months. Things happen downrange. I\u0027ve seen it. How do I say this? It\u0027s a disaster waiting to happen.  \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASpecialist Veronica Alfaro, Army National Guard \u000AFirefight during a late-night convoy outside Baghdad in fall 2007. Awarded a Bronze Star With Valor for saving the life of a foreign national while under fire; awarded a Combat Action Badge for the events described below.\u000A\u000AThat night I was the gunner, because we were short a soldier. Our convoy was about halfway to our destination when we hit a spot in the road where we have to really slow down. I have the night-vision goggle on one eye, and all of a sudden I can hear these loud snaps right by my head. I dropped down, and I was like, \u0022Shit. Here we go.\u0022 I started returning fire with my smaller weapons, and then I could see, far away in the brush, muzzle flashes. So I started unloading the .50-cal, and I just let it rock. I can\u0027t even describe that rush. Round for round, you\u0027re shooting back and forth. It was insane. Then the muzzle flashes stopped.\u000A\u000AThe thing about that story is, nobody believed me. Some of the senior leadership thought I made it up just so I could shoot the gun. The next morning, when the sun came up, the guys who didn\u0027t believe me were climbing all over the truck looking for where bullets maybe hit. Sure enough, a bullet had taken a chunk out of the protective glass of the turret—just a little bit over and that thing would\u0027ve smacked me, like, square in the fucking chest. After that, nobody said anything to me anymore.\u000A\u000AWhen they gave me the Combat Action Badge, there were some other people who also got awards—all guys. There\u0027s a tradition when the infantry get their badges: They pin it on your shirt, and then they use their fists to pound it on your chest—like, \u0022That\u0027s in your blood now.\u0022 It\u0027s kind of a thing. But the company commander just handed me my badge and moved down the line.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A3. The Hygiene Issue, Kayla Williams \u000AIt seemed as if a lot of these guys had really major misconceptions about female anatomy. They were like, \u0022What about the hygiene issue?\u0022 I\u0027m like, \u0022What do you mean?\u0022 And they\u0027re like, \u0022You know.\u0022 I\u0027m like, \u0022No, I don\u0027t know.\u0022 And they would never actually be willing to say, \u0022Won\u0027t you get an infection in your vagina?\u0022 They were terrified of it. They were like, \u0022But...but...but...periods!\u0022 We don\u0027t die without showers.\u000A\u000AElena Woods \u000AA lot of our females used a Depo shot, which stops your menstrual cycle.\u000A\u000ACaptain Michelle Racicot, surgical nurse, Army \u000AThere\u0027s a funnel you can get for women so that you can pee standing up. You pack it in your rucksack.\u000A\u000AMichele Greco-Lucchina\u000AWe all use the WAG bags over there, which are waste bags that you go to the bathroom in, and it\u0027s got a little kitty litter at the bottom that catches everything. Once we went down to a smaller observation post, and they were so low on WAG bags that we were reusing them. You would do your business and leave it there for the next guy. If any female that joined was grossed out, then they shouldn\u0027t have been there in the first place, and we all knew that.\u000A\u000AHeather Boyd \u000AI\u0027m a squatter. That\u0027s what I do. Sometimes I held it in for a really long time, and I\u0027m probably going to regret that when I\u0027m 80. Let me tell you what: I have never shit so much in my life as when I was deployed. Because you\u0027re eating local food, weird schedules, weird bottled water from who knows where it comes from. You\u0027re just sick all the time. You take a lot of Imodium. I did some gross things out behind a rock somewhere.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestLeigh Ann Hester\u000A\u000ALeigh Ann Hester \u000AWe had to do some things in front of each other—y\u0027all don\u0027t know the half of it.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ATania Dunbar\u000AEvents occurring at Camp Bondsteel in eastern Kosovo during winter 2001. \u000A\u000AI got off the plane, and this guy walks up to me and says, \u0022Fuck, it\u0027s a female. We don\u0027t have females in this unit.\u0022 The drive to Kosovo took three hours. Somewhere along the way he looks at me and he goes, \u0022Females are either psychos, whores, or dykes. Which one are you?\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen I go in the tent, it\u0027s like in the movies where the music stops and everyone just turns and like [record-scratching noise]. There\u0027s half-naked guys and pictures of naked women, calendars. I might as well have been walking into a men\u0027s locker room. It was a National Guard unit from Pennsylvania, so they\u0027re all white men. I\u0027m half black and half Mexican.\u000A\u000AA radar broke, and I went out in the middle of the night in the freezing cold to fix it. It was simple that time, but this thing started happening where the problems became more and more difficult. I would tell myself, \u0022I know I fid this,\u0022 but I\u0027d turn around and a part would be missing. There were times when I was really doubting my sanity. I finally realized the radar was getting broken on purpose. But no one talked to me. The higher-ranking people ignored me completely, like I didn\u0027t even exist. We didn\u0027t have e-mail at that time, so I didn\u0027t have anybody to talk to, to ask, \u0022What is going on?\u0022\u000A\u000AThere was just one shower. I made a sign: \u0022Female in the Shower.\u0022 But every time I was in the shower, someone would walk in and open the door and get a good look and be like, \u0022Oops!\u0022 and close the door and walk away. It happened all the time. There was nothing I could do about it.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A4. Keep Your Mouth Shut\u000A\u000ABetween October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2011, a total of 2,723 service members reported having been victims of sexual assault. It\u0027s estimated—according to the Pentagon itself—that more than 16,000 others were also assaulted during this time and did not report it.\u000A\u000AKayla Williams \u000AEvery time I\u0027d ever experienced any type of sexual harassment, the response from guys was always \u0022How you going to ruin some man\u0027s career just because you can\u0027t take it?\u0022 Like, that literal phrase. They would say, \u0022This is a man\u0027s army; how did you expect to be treated?\u0022 The subtle implication was that a man\u0027s career was always more important than a woman\u0027s—and that since I couldn\u0027t be a combat-arms soldier, I wasn\u0027t a \u0022real\u0022 soldier. I think that plays into creating the climate that tolerated treating women worse.\u000A\u000AMajor Mary Jennings Hegar, Air National Guard \u000AI was sexually assaulted on active duty. It was during a medical exam, and I was visibly shaken—which, anybody who knows me, it\u0027s pretty hard to get me physically shaken. The perpetrator self-identified [confessed to his commanding officer] immediately, before I had even processed it. When he received a big award very shortly thereafter, I realized the Air Force wasn\u0027t the place for me.\u000A\u000AVeronica Alfaro \u000AWhen an officer is talking about your tits and saying he wants to bend you over, where do you go for help? I know men who witnessed females in their company being harassed, and they didn\u0027t think it was right to treat a counterpart that way. But the minute they spoke up to say something, they start taking heat, too. It was better just to keep your mouth shut and stay out of it than come under fire.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestStaff Sergeant Marti Ribeiro\u000A\u000AStaff Sergeant Marti Ribeiro, Air Force\u000AMy sergeant major gave me a knife when I got to Afghanistan. The knife wasn\u0027t for the bad guys; it was for the guys in our uniform. I\u0027m five-foot-eight and blonde, so I got the nickname Combat Barbie. When I was raped, I had put my weapon in the wooden rack inside the guard-duty station, and then I had walked ten feet to have a cigarette. It happened so fast that I don\u0027t know if I would\u0027ve even been able to use my weapon. But I\u0027ve watched enough Law &amp; Order: SVU to know that you don\u0027t go take a shower. The person I reported the assault to was female, and she told me that because I had left my weapon ten feet away, I would be charged with dereliction of duty. So I didn\u0027t report it.\u000A\u000AFor the remaining two and a half months of my deployment, I didn\u0027t tell a soul. I went numb. When I got home, I lashed out at my husband, not knowing that it was the psychological crap I was dealing with. It caused us to separate and eventually divorce. Even after years of therapy, I feel that those two and a half months somehow destroyed that internal I-love-life thing, you know? I\u0027ve truly never been able to get it back.\u000A\u000AThe perpetrator works for the Department of Defense and hasn\u0027t suffered any repercussions. I can tell you that this is a bigger issue than anyone realizes. Because you don\u0027t tell on them. You just don\u0027t. I know a lot of people are thinking the military\u0027s not ready to handle women in combat because of sexual assaults, but I don\u0027t think we should deny women the chance to do something because the men aren\u0027t behaving. They need to discipline their men.\u000A\u000ASergeant Rebekah Havrilla, explosive-ordnance disposal, Army \u000AYou get a DUI, you\u0027re pretty much done—and that\u0027s across the forces. Why can\u0027t you do it with sexual assault?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARhonda Cornum \u000AShot down somewhere near Basra, Iraq, on February 27, 1991. Awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross, a Purple Heart, and a POW Medal.\u000A\u000ASexual assault is one more bad thing the enemy can do to you, but it\u0027s not unique to women. At the end of the Gulf War, my Black Hawk was going out to rescue a guy who\u0027d been shot down out of an F-16. He\u0027d bailed out, and he had a broken leg. Unfortunately, about a kilometer away from him, we got shot down. We crashed. Five guys got killed in the wreck, and three of us were captured. I got shot in the right shoulder, which broke my right arm and caused a fair amount of blood loss. I broke my left arm in the crash. I had a complete transection of the ACL in my right knee.\u000A\u000AAfter we were captured, there was a mock execution where they have a gun at the back of your head and they\u0027re trying to get you to talk. The gun goes click, and I guess you\u0027re supposed to be scared so maybe you\u0027ll be more forthcoming. I had nothing to say. Part of the mistreatment included being sexually assaulted. There\u0027s a thought that says if a woman with them is sexually assaulted, men will do some stupid heroic thing and get themselves killed. A fellow POW was there; he didn\u0027t try to do anything about it. They grabbed my broken arm to pull me upright and displaced the bone. Nobody ever died of pain.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A5. Your Deployment Hotness\u000A\u000AChief Petty Officer Jackey Smith, combat photographer, Navy \u000AWhen a female Air Force combat camera correspondent arrived, one of the first things I said to her was, \u0022Take your sunglasses off. They have glitter on them. Absolutely not.\u0022\u000A\u000ASarah Furrer \u000AI\u0027ve seen female Marines and soldiers react the way they shouldn\u0027t—smile or blush or flirt back or become friends with men they shouldn\u0027t be friends with. The second someone sees you flirting with somebody you shouldn\u0027t be, your reputation\u0027s out the window.\u000A\u000AMichelle Racicot \u000AYou don\u0027t wear makeup, even if you want to. Every once in a while you\u0027re like, \u0022I would like to put on some powder.\u0022 But you can\u0027t do that. You don\u0027t wear perfume, you don\u0027t wear shiny lip gloss. You don\u0027t make yourself anything but a soldier, because if you do, you could get unwanted attention.\u000A\u000AFirst Sergeant Nanette Gruch, Army National Guard\u000AIt kind of blew my mind when I saw it. I couldn\u0027t believe female officers were doing this. They were rolling up their shorts to right below their butt cheeks. Some of them were running around in tank tops and then just putting on the makeup. There\u0027s a scale that\u0027s put on females. You\u0027ve got your deployment hotness, and you\u0027ve got your garrison hotness. A girl that\u0027s in the 9 deployment-hotness range—really, in garrison, she\u0027s only like a 5. I said, \u0022I know this sounds horrible, but if anything happens to you, the first thing that\u0027s going to come out of their mouths is \u0027She asked for it.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AStaff Sergeant Jennifer Hunt, Army \u000AThere\u0027s a joke that if you\u0027re deployed and you\u0027re talking with someone, you\u0027re obviously having a sexual relationship with that guy.\u000A\u000ACarolyn Schapper \u000AI worked with a female who really enjoyed the male attention and preferred to hang around men. By the end, she was being harassed; she was being called \u0022the slut of Bayji.\u0022 It was written on her desk. Her commanding officer didn\u0027t care. She felt totally alone, because there was no one to help her. It takes just a few women like that to perpetuate these stories that all these women are sleeping with all these men. I don\u0027t like telling this story, because I did judge her, too.\u000A\u000AMary Jennings Hegar \u000AI take real issue with people who act like we\u0027re going to disrupt some kind of band of brothers, because the men and women that I went into combat with, I have a very significant bond with. I mean, I\u0027m still in touch with the guys that I got shot down with. There\u0027s something about when you would take a bullet for someone that just never goes away, okay?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AStaff Sergeant Michelle Loftus, combat medic, Army\u000A Caught in an explosion near Baghdad International Airport on July 23, 2003. Awarded a Purple Heart and a Combat Action Badge.\u000A\u000AWe were on our way back from a route recon, and there was a loud boom. The air was full of dust, and I instantly felt something rip through the front of my face. The vehicle went up on its side, then came back down, and we pushed through. We passed a man with a cell phone, which is typically how they would detonate IEDs, and I fired one round at him. When we did a roll call through the vehicle, I couldn\u0027t answer because of my injuries. I lost bone and teeth and had a very big open hole between the bottom of my nose and the top of my lip. The roof of my mouth was peeled back. I\u0027ve spoken to a number of veterans, and we react, I think, in the same way to getting injured. Your adrenaline is pumping, but I can remember being just very angry. I could not believe that they had the audacity to get me.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestJackey Smith\u000A\u000A6. A Less Macho Future\u000A\u000AJackey Smith\u000A I have been told that I\u0027m harder on women. To any of my female mentees, I always say, \u0022More is expected of you. It just is. Never, ever let anybody use your gender as an excuse.\u0022\u000A\u000ACarol A. Mutter \u000ATwenty years from now we\u0027re going to say, \u0022Why didn\u0027t we have women in combat?\u0022 It\u0027s the same thing with African-Americans in World War II: \u0022They\u0027re not smart enough to fly. They can\u0027t be pilots.\u0022 Well, they proved that they could be.\u000A\u000ASarah Furrer \u000AThese girls just want to do their jobs. They\u0027re not joining these ranks to piss people off. I don\u0027t see, you know, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen trying to be infantrymen. These aren\u0027t the type of girls that are going to join.\u000A\u000AKayla Williams \u000ALynndie England took part in abusing detainees [at Abu Ghraib]. Women aren\u0027t inherently better people than men, right? But if you look at raw numbers, we are much less likely to commit acts of sexual violence. Sexual atrocities against civilian populations have been a part of combat for a long, long time. Would that be less likely to happen if there were women in more situations? Similarly, when you have these counterinsurgency operations where you\u0027re trying to win hearts and minds, is this incredibly macho culture optimal?\u000A\u000ACaptain Victoria Sherwood, FET member, Marines\u000A I wanted to write letters back to all my women\u0027s-college peers and say, \u0022I have found the true feminism. It\u0027s just who gets the job done.\u0022 I feel a little bit betrayed by the modern feminist movement, because I didn\u0027t really see them picking up our cause. The military offers wild opportunities for leadership at the youngest age. I wish more women saw this as an avenue for empowerment, because it\u0027s really hard to tell a woman who\u0027s been on foot patrol in Afghanistan where her glass ceiling is anymore.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestMary Jennings Hegar\u000A\u000AMary Jennings Hegar\u000A Shot down during a medevac mission north of Kandahar, Afghanistan, on July 29, 2009. Awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross and a Purple Heart.\u000A\u000AWe were on a mission to pick up three injured soldiers whose convoy had hit an IED and who had then come under fire. We didn\u0027t know at the time that this IED was placed there specifically to lure in a medevac helicopter.\u000A\u000AWhen we landed, we deplaned our Special Operations medics, but we took a bullet through my windshield that fragmented. The pieces entered my arm and leg and created a lot of blood. My gunner says over SATCOM, \u0022Our co-pilot\u0027s hit. We\u0027re RTB\u0022—return to base. I said, \u0022We\u0027ve deplaned two Special Operations guys. We\u0027ve got three patients on the ground.\u0022 I\u0027m squeezing my fist, demonstrating I can fly. They\u0027re like, \u0022Let\u0027s go back in.\u0022 This time the enemy tears us up with belt-fed heavy machine guns. Just Swiss-cheesing us. But by hand signal I\u0027m telling my commander, \u0022Don\u0027t take off,\u0022 because through the hail of fire the Special Operations guys are putting the patients onto the aircraft.\u000A\u000AFinally we take off, at which point we see one of the fuel lines has ruptured. We need to land or we\u0027re going to crash. It\u0027s a hard landing. We start taking heavier fire on my side of the aircraft. One of the three patients on board, a female, is hysterical, and my gunner says to me, \u0022This is why they shouldn\u0027t let women on those kinds of convoys.\u0022 I look at him. I\u0027m armed, I\u0027m covered in blood, and I\u0027m like, \u0022Are you fucking kidding me?\u0022",

We knew that the only way we were going to end this is if we took them out. The staff sergeant and myself, we jumped in the trench; our teammate followed us along the top. I was so concentrated that I couldn&apos;t hear the bullets. I didn&apos;t even hear my own rifle. We hugged the wall of the trench on the right side. It kind of jutted out a little bit and gave us cover, but we couldn&apos;t get the right angle to kill them with our rifles. We resorted to throwing grenades. That did the trick. Looking at what was left of them, I felt nothing.  A woman can&apos;t be a killer?

The way this war in Iraq was fought, there was really no front line. You could get hit just as easily on the base as during a mission. It didn&apos;t matter if you were infantry or not; we went out with infantry all the time. We all had the same equipment, the same combat load, the same types of missions.

Women weren&apos;t assigned to combat-arms units, but we were &quot;attached&quot; to them as needed. I ended up going on combat patrols with the infantry. Because I was female and because this was Rumsfeld&apos;s &quot;You go to war with the army you have&quot; phase, I did not have plates for my flak vest. If women aren&apos;t in combat and if you only have so many plates to go around, why would you give them to the women?</p><p data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Corporal Sarah Furrer, FET member, Marines</strong>

My platoon daddy is tugging on my pants, because he&apos;s lying in a litter below me. He says, &quot;I can&apos;t feel my legs.&quot; I looked down and I saw what I saw, and I said, &quot;We&apos;ve got you, sir. We&apos;re getting you home.

I flipped the switch, and my jet started climbing out and away from Baghdad. But the jet isn&apos;t designed to land in manual reversion. In Desert Storm, I knew, there had been three manual-reversion landings attempted. In one, the pilot was killed. In another, the jet was destroyed and the pilot was lucky to survive.

Sure enough, a bullet had taken a chunk out of the protective glass of the turret&#x2014;just a little bit over and that thing would&apos;ve smacked me, like, square in the fucking chest.

Every time I&apos;d ever experienced any type of sexual harassment, the response from guys was always &quot;How you going to ruin some man&apos;s career just because you can&apos;t take it?&quot; Like, that literal phrase. They would say, &quot;This is a man&apos;s army; how did you expect to be treated?&quot; The subtle implication was that a man&apos;s career was always more important than a woman&apos;s&#x2014;and that since I couldn&apos;t be a combat-arms soldier, I wasn&apos;t a &quot;real&quot; soldier.

My sergeant major gave me a knife when I got to Afghanistan. The knife wasn&apos;t for the bad guys; it was for the guys in our uniform. I&apos;m five-foot-eight and blonde, so I got the nickname Combat Barbie. When I was raped, I had put my weapon in the wooden rack inside the guard-duty station, and then I had walked ten feet to have a cigarette. It happened so fast that I don&apos;t know if I would&apos;ve even been able to use my weapon. But I&apos;ve watched enough <em>Law &amp; Order: SVU</em> to know that you don&apos;t go take a shower. The person I reported the assault to was female, and she told me that because I had left my weapon ten feet away, I would be charged with dereliction of duty.

There&apos;s a thought that says if a woman with them is sexually assaulted, men will do some stupid heroic thing and get themselves killed.

The air was full of dust, and I instantly felt something rip through the front of my face. The vehicle went up on its side, then came back down, and we pushed through. We passed a man with a cell phone, which is typically how they would detonate IEDs, and I fired one round at him. When we did a roll call through the vehicle, I couldn&apos;t answer because of my injuries. I lost bone and teeth and had a very big open hole between the bottom of my nose and the top of my lip.

I could not believe that they had the audacity to get me.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2c"><hr></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2d"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583063f09f0bee56440e423/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-smith.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-smith.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funited-states-military-women-gq-may-2013&amp;t=news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-smith.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funited-states-military-women-gq-may-2013&amp;t=news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-smith.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funited-states-military-women-gq-may-2013&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583063f09f0bee56440e423%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-smith.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-smith.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funited-states-military-women-gq-may-2013&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583063f09f0bee56440e423%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-smith.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-smith.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>Jackey Smith</p></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2e"><h2>6.

 I have been told that I&apos;m harder on women. To any of my female mentees, I always say, &quot;More is expected of you. It just is. Never, ever let anybody use your gender as an excuse.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2g"><strong>Carol A. Mutter</strong> 
Twenty years from now we&apos;re going to say, &quot;Why didn&apos;t we have women in combat?&quot; It&apos;s the same thing with African-Americans in World War II: &quot;They&apos;re not smart enough to fly. They can&apos;t be pilots.&quot; Well, they proved that they could be.</p><p data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2h"><strong>Sarah Furrer</strong> 
These girls just want to do their jobs. They&apos;re not joining these ranks to piss people off. I don&apos;t see, you know, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen trying to be infantrymen. These aren&apos;t the type of girls that are going to join.</p><p data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2i"><strong>Kayla Williams</strong> 
Lynndie England took part in abusing detainees [at Abu Ghraib]. Women aren&apos;t inherently better people than men, right? But if you look at raw numbers, we are much less likely to commit acts of sexual violence. Sexual atrocities against civilian populations have been a part of combat for a long, long time. Would that be less likely to happen if there were women in more situations? Similarly, when you have these counterinsurgency operations where you&apos;re trying to win hearts and minds, is this incredibly macho culture optimal?</p><p data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2j"><strong>Captain Victoria Sherwood, FET member, Marines</strong>
 I wanted to write letters back to all my women&apos;s-college peers and say, &quot;I have found the true feminism. It&apos;s just who gets the job done.&quot; I feel a little bit betrayed by the modern feminist movement, because I didn&apos;t really see them picking up our cause. The military offers wild opportunities for leadership at the youngest age. I wish more women saw this as an avenue for empowerment, because it&apos;s really hard to tell a woman who&apos;s been on foot patrol in Afghanistan where her glass ceiling is anymore.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2k"><hr></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2l"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583063f09f0bee56440e431/master/w_600/news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-hegar.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-hegar.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funited-states-military-women-gq-may-2013&amp;t=news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-hegar.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funited-states-military-women-gq-may-2013&amp;t=news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-hegar.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funited-states-military-women-gq-may-2013&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583063f09f0bee56440e431%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-hegar.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-hegar.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Funited-states-military-women-gq-may-2013&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583063f09f0bee56440e431%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-hegar.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2013-05-natural-born-killers-hegar.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>Mary Jennings Hegar</p></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2m"><strong>Mary Jennings Hegar</strong>
 <em>Shot down during a medevac mission north of Kandahar, Afghanistan, on July 29, 2009. Awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross and a Purple Heart.</em></p><p data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2n">We were on a mission to pick up three injured soldiers whose convoy had hit an IED and who had then come under fire. We didn&apos;t know at the time that this IED was placed there specifically to lure in a medevac helicopter.</p><p data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2o">When we landed, we deplaned our Special Operations medics, but we took a bullet through my windshield that fragmented. The pieces entered my arm and leg and created a lot of blood. My gunner says over SATCOM, &quot;Our co-pilot&apos;s hit. We&apos;re RTB&quot;&#x2014;return to base. I said, &quot;We&apos;ve deplaned two Special Operations guys. We&apos;ve got three patients on the ground.&quot; I&apos;m squeezing my fist, demonstrating I can fly. They&apos;re like, &quot;Let&apos;s go back in.&quot; This time the enemy tears us up with belt-fed heavy machine guns. Just Swiss-cheesing us. But by hand signal I&apos;m telling my commander, &quot;Don&apos;t take off,&quot; because through the hail of fire the Special Operations guys are putting the patients onto the aircraft.</p><p data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.4.2p">Finally we take off, at which point we see one of the fuel lines has ruptured. We need to land or we&apos;re going to crash. It&apos;s a hard landing. We start taking heavier fire on my side of the aircraft. One of the three patients on board, a female, is hysterical, and my gunner says to me, &quot;This is why they shouldn&apos;t let women on those kinds of convoys.&quot; I look at him. I&apos;m armed, I&apos;m covered in blood, and I&apos;m like, &quot;Are you fucking kidding me?&quot;</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".10wj5qv9j40.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
