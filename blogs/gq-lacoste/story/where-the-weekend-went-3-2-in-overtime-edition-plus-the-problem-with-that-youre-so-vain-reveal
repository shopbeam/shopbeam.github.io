  	    "articleBody": "Fine Canada, You Can Have This One\u000A\u000A Even if you never ever watch hockey, you probably watched this one: Canada vs. USA for the gold medal in the Olympics\u0027 final competition. And you may have even liked watching it because, man oh man, this was good stuff. Down 2-1, late in the game, the Americans pulled their stud goalkeeper Ryan Miller to get an extra man on the ice, and with 24 seconds left Zach Parise put one away to send the game to overtime. (Don\u0027t forget!: Two nations, one BORDER.) In OT, none other than Sid \u0022The Kid\u0022 Crosby (i.e. the best thing to happen to hockey since mullets) sealed the victory for Canada—which in the end was probably for the better. Is it okay to say that? That they kinda sorta needed that one? They\u0027re Canadians, not Communists. —Daniel Riley\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest060216flamevlrg_5a.widec.jpg\u000A\u000AThat Said, From the Department of Poor Word Choice\u000A\u000A Dear NBC,\u000A\u000AIn the future, when referencing the luger who died by cracking his skull against a wall, it\u0027s for the best if you don\u0027t use the phrase \u0022left an indelible mark\u0022 as a description.\u000A\u000ASincerely yours,\u000A\u000AGQ\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestCarly Simon.png\u000A\u000A**\u000A\u000A Things We Already Basically Knew—Revealed! Or, How David Geffen Met Your Mother\u000A\u000A **So after 38 years of near-Sphinxian coyness, Carly Simon kinda-sorta revealed who \u0022You\u0027re So Vain\u0022 is about, telling British dad-rock magazine Uncut that if you play her newish re-recording of the song—available on her album Never Been Gone, absolutely coincidentally in stores now—backwards, you can hear her whisper the guy\u0027s name. The assumption has always been that the song was a diss track about one of Simon\u0027s many famous es. She\u0027s hinted that it\u0027s a little bit about Warren Beatty (who claimed in 2007 that the song was about him) or Mick Jagger (who sang uncredited backing vocals on the original track) and denied that it\u0027s about her ex-husband James Taylor; other suspects, by virtue of having dated Simon in the past, include Kris Kristofferson, Cat Stevens, and the Phillie Phanatic, notoriously the most self-involved of all professional-sports mascots.\u000A\u000ABut it sounds, on the new song, like she\u0027s saying \u0022David,\u0022 a fact that multiple media outlets immediately jumped on as smoking-gun proof that \u0022You\u0027re So Vain\u0022 was about record-biz icon (or, as UK tabloid the Sun put it, \u0022gay producer\u0022) David Geffen. A story developed: Geffen, in his capacity as head of Simon\u0027s record label, lavished Joni Mitchell with attention while ignoring Simon\u0027s needs, moving her to put him on blast, soft-rockishly. Case closed! Coffee-clouds dissolved! TV ec Dick Ebersol, who paid $50,000 at a charity auction a couple years ago for a private performance of the song that ended with Simon whispering the name of the subject in his ear, made to feel like a grade-A sucker!\u000A\u000ABefore long, though, Simon\u0027s ex-husband Jim Hart—who is probably not the subject of the song, but remains a crucial figure in \u0022You\u0027re So Vain\u0022-ology, cited multiple times on the song\u0027s extremely thorough Wikipedia page, which also (seriously) features two different solar-eclipse diagrams—popped up to deny the Geffen reveal, and Fox 411 entertainment columnist and scourge of inaccuracy Roger Friedman pointed out the story\u0027s fatal flaw: Simon recorded No Secrets, the album \u0022You\u0027re So Vain\u0022 appeared on, for Elektra Records in 1972, and it wasn\u0027t until 1973 that Elektra merged with Geffen\u0027s Asylum label. Friedman quotes a \u0022friend of Simon\u0022 as saying that Simon did feel slighted by Geffen in favor of Mitchell—but not until 1974, when Elektra/Asylum put out both her album Hot Cakes and Mitchell\u0027s Court and Spark. (Friedman traces the faulty timeline back to a November post by an IFC.com blogger, who was in turn responding to a Simon public-radio interview that month in which she actually revealed the \u0022David\u0022 thing, but nobody cared, because, y\u0027know, public radio.)\u000A\u000APeople were actually kind of disappointed by the Geffen reveal before it was disproved—for years, \u0022You\u0027re So Vain\u0022 has been a jumping-off point for speculation about the private lives of various personalities who traveled in upper-echelon film/music circles during the 1970s, about America\u0027s astronauts of promiscuity and how they rolled, and when it turned out, or seemed to turn out, that it was actually about Simon\u0027s strained professional relationship with a gay producer, you could actually hear the entire world, or at least the whole Internet, go \u0022Meh\u0022 at once. Village Voice music editor Rob Harvilla started Tweeting a string of other unexciting/song-ruining lyric-subject reveals. \u0022lady gaga just revealed that \u0027bad romance\u0027 is about steve jobs...\u0027nothing compares 2 u\u0027 is about lee iaccoca...\u0027I want a little sugar in my bowl\u0027 is about henry ford.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut honestly, we\u0027re kind of bummed out that it\u0027s not about Geffen, if only because, for a minute, when we thought it was, there was suddenly a reason to care about this mystery and its resolution. Because, c\u0027mon—it\u0027s not like \u0022You\u0027re So Vain,\u0022 minus the blind-item baggage, is even that compelling of a song. That line about the guy walking into a party like he\u0027s walking on a yacht is a nice bit of description, and the tune itself is catchy in a blowsy, Carole-King-walks-onto-a-yacht kind of way. But it lacks—for example—the impressive emotional wreckedness of \u0022Coming Around Again,\u0022 the synth-sloggy \u002780s hit Simon sang from the perspective of a housewife who\u0027s given up hope, a song that basically depicted the institution of marriage as a minimum-security prison of the soul. (Or that\u0027s how it\u0027s always sounded to us, anyway. We sometimes think that hearing this song—which was really popular, despite being incredibly depressing—on pop radio about seventeen thousand times at an impressionable age did more to make us gun-shy about long-term commitment than our own parents\u0027 divorce; there was something about the harmonies on the \u0022Burn the souflee/Scream a lullaby\u0022 verse that we found absolutely terrifying.)\u000A\u000AMore importantly, though, it\u0027s not like we don\u0027t already know that Warren Beatty and Mick Jagger were not super-conscientious boyfriends in the early \u002770s. The song turning out to be about Geffen was the closest thing this mystery could have had to a man-bites-dog ending. \u0022The fact that \u0022You\u0027re So Vain\u0022 is about business (as opposed to pleasure) suddenly makes that song about 10 times more original,\u0022 said occasional GQ contributor and friend of this blog Chuck Klosterman, also on Twitter. This, at the time, seemed totally right-on. There are millions of songs about faithless lovers; the my-label-should-have-promoted-me-better lament doesn\u0027t become a viable pop genre until the advent of hip-hop and/or Aimee Mann. More importantly, if it was a song about the music industry, it was kind of a song about Carly Simon\u0027s vanity, right? About her belief that Geffen should have, we dunno, placed more trade ads for her album or shipped more cardboard Carly Simon stand-ups to record stores or not flown up to Nova Scotia instead of taking her phone call—and maybe, also, her belief that she was as good as Joni Mitchell. (If Geffen was neglecting Simon, it probably had less to do with him or her and more to do with Mitchell—we can debate whether or not she\u0027s ten times the singer/songwriter Carly Simon is, but based on everything we\u0027ve ever read about her it\u0027s hard to imagine that she\u0027s not a ten-thousand-times-squeakier wheel, artist/label-relationship-wise. Incidentally, the second single off Court &amp; Spark? \u0022Free Man In Paris,\u0022 a song Mitchell has confirmed is about—you guessed it—David Geffen, with whom she had the kind of platonic relationship that the Facebook status-designator \u0022It\u0027s Complicated\u0022 would someday be invented to describe.)\u000A\u000AThe above-mentioned Wikipedia page reminded us that Carly Simon has dined out, kind of annoyingly, on the whole \u0022You\u0027re So Vain\u0022 mystery for years, seeding the press with clues and hints and non-denial denials, revealing a letter here and a letter there. It would obviously be cooler if she\u0027d never said anything, but we\u0027re not going to fault her—you\u0027ve gotta do something to compete as Carly Simon in an iCarly world. (Also, she kinda needs to sell some records.) The larger issue here, to the extremely limited extent that there is one, is that the scoopy, spoiler-happy times in which we live will eventually dissolve every interesting pop-cultural ambiguity, and that makes us sad. Does anybody really like Alanis Morrissette\u0027s \u0022You Oughta Know\u0022 more now that we know it\u0027s about oral-sexing Uncle Joey from Full House? Would it add anything to our enjoyment of \u0022I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won\u0027t Do That)\u0022 if it turned out Meat Loaf was singing about his reluctance to watch ice-dancing? We don\u0027t want to get all JJ Abrams about this, but sometimes the fun is in the not-knowing. And as a culture we\u0027re so addicted to meaningless closure that we\u0027re ruining everything for ourselves. When somebody asked Bill Murray what his character whispers in Scarlett Johansson\u0027s ear at the end of Lost In Translation, he said \u0022It\u0027s between lovers,\u0022 which is a great non-answer; here\u0027s hoping he never feels the need to offer up a real one. —Alex Pappademas\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestCop Out.png\u000A\u000A Blown Opportunities 101: Cop Out \u000A\u000A Let us get this straight, Hollywood: You line up VERGE heroes Tracy Morgan and Bruce Willis. You come up with a killer idea (Lethal Weapon parody). You get Kevin Smith to direct—and to gin up a fatty feud for media purposes. And it comes out like this? Check those reviews: \u0022Sluggish and formulaic\u0022; \u0022A soulless, witless, landfill contraption that Smith once would have mocked mercilessly\u0022; \u0022Desperation oozes from every frame of Cop Out, which front-loads its best joke—then spends the rest of its running time endlessly spinning its wheels.\u0022\u000A\u000AHOLLYWOOD, HOW DO YOU BLOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

And you may have even liked watching it because, man oh man, this was good stuff. Down 2-1, late in the game, the Americans pulled their stud goalkeeper Ryan Miller to get an extra man on the ice, and with 24 seconds left Zach Parise put one away to send the game to overtime. (Don&#x2019;t forget!: Two nations, one BORDER.) In OT, none other than Sid &quot;The Kid&quot; Crosby (i.e. the best thing to happen to hockey since mullets) sealed the victory for Canada&#x2014;which in the end was probably for the better. Is it okay to say that? That they kinda sorta needed that one?

Or, How David Geffen Met Your Mother</p><p data-reactid=".bpdqnp6k1s.1.1.0.0.4.c"> **So after 38 years of near-Sphinxian coyness, Carly Simon kinda-sorta revealed who &quot;You&#x2019;re So Vain&quot; is about, telling British dad-rock magazine Uncut that if you play her newish re-recording of the song&#x2014;available on her album Never Been Gone, absolutely coincidentally in stores now&#x2014;backwards, you can hear her whisper the guy&#x2019;s name. The assumption has always been that the song was a diss track about one of Simon&#x2019;s many famous es. She&#x2019;s hinted that it&#x2019;s a little bit about Warren Beatty (who claimed in 2007 that the song was about him) or Mick Jagger (who sang uncredited backing vocals on the original track) and denied that it&#x2019;s about her ex-husband James Taylor; other suspects, by virtue of having dated Simon in the past, include Kris Kristofferson, Cat Stevens, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillie_Phanatic">Phillie Phanatic</a>, notoriously the most self-involved of all professional-sports mascots.</p><p data-reactid=".bpdqnp6k1s.1.1.0.0.4.d">But it sounds, on the new song, like she&#x2019;s saying &quot;David,&quot; a fact that multiple media outlets immediately jumped on as smoking-gun proof that &quot;You&#x2019;re So Vain&quot; was about record-biz icon (or, as UK tabloid the Sun put it, &quot;gay producer&quot;) David Geffen. A story developed: Geffen, in his capacity as head of Simon&#x2019;s record label, lavished Joni Mitchell with attention while ignoring Simon&#x2019;s needs, moving her to put him on blast, soft-rockishly. Case closed! Coffee-clouds dissolved! TV ec Dick Ebersol, who <a href="http://www.carlysimon.com/vain/vain.html">paid $50,000 at a charity auction</a> a couple years ago for a private performance of the song that ended with Simon whispering the name of the subject in his ear, made to feel like a grade-A sucker!</p><p data-reactid=".bpdqnp6k1s.1.1.0.0.4.e">Before long, though, Simon&#x2019;s ex-husband Jim Hart&#x2014;who is probably not the subject of the song, but remains a crucial figure in &quot;You&#x2019;re So Vain&quot;-ology, cited multiple times on the song&#x2019;s extremely thorough <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You&#x2019;re_So_Vain">Wikipedia page</a>, which also (seriously) features two different solar-eclipse diagrams&#x2014;popped up to deny the Geffen reveal, and Fox 411 entertainment columnist and scourge of inaccuracy Roger Friedman <a href="http://showbiz411.blogs.thr.com/2010/02/26/carly-simon-so-vain-david-geffen/">pointed out</a> the story&#x2019;s fatal flaw: Simon recorded No Secrets, the album &quot;You&#x2019;re So Vain&quot; appeared on, for Elektra Records in 1972, and it wasn&#x2019;t until 1973 that Elektra merged with Geffen&#x2019;s Asylum label. Friedman quotes a &quot;friend of Simon&quot; as saying that Simon did feel slighted by Geffen in favor of Mitchell&#x2014;but not until 1974, when Elektra/Asylum put out both her album Hot Cakes and Mitchell&#x2019;s Court and Spark. (Friedman traces the faulty timeline back to a November post by an <a href="http://www.ifc.com/blogs/indie-ear/2009/11/youre-so-vain-carly-simon-fina.php">IFC.com blogger</a>, who was in turn responding to a Simon public-radio interview that month in which she actually revealed the &quot;David&quot; thing, but nobody cared, because, y&#x2019;know, public radio.)</p><p data-reactid=".bpdqnp6k1s.1.1.0.0.4.f">People were actually kind of disappointed by the Geffen reveal before it was disproved&#x2014;for years, &quot;You&#x2019;re So Vain&quot; has been a jumping-off point for speculation about the private lives of various personalities who traveled in upper-echelon film/music circles during the 1970s, about America&#x2019;s astronauts of promiscuity and how they rolled, and when it turned out, or seemed to turn out, that it was actually about Simon&#x2019;s strained professional relationship with a gay producer, you could actually hear the entire world, or at least the whole Internet, go &quot;Meh&quot; at once. Village Voice music editor <a href="http://twitter.com/harvilla/status/96878670270">Rob Harvilla started Tweeting</a> a string of other unexciting/song-ruining lyric-subject reveals. &quot;lady gaga just revealed that &#x2019;bad romance&#x2019; is about steve jobs...&#x2019;nothing compares 2 u&#x2019; is about lee iaccoca...&#x2019;I want a little sugar in my bowl&#x2019; is about henry ford.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".bpdqnp6k1s.1.1.0.0.4.g">But honestly, we&#x2019;re kind of bummed out that it&#x2019;s not about Geffen, if only because, for a minute, when we thought it was, there was suddenly a reason to care about this mystery and its resolution. Because, c&#x2019;mon&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not like &quot;You&#x2019;re So Vain,&quot; minus the blind-item baggage, is even that compelling of a song. That line about the guy walking into a party like he&#x2019;s walking on a yacht is a nice bit of description, and the tune itself is catchy in a blowsy, Carole-King-walks-onto-a-yacht kind of way. But it lacks&#x2014;for example&#x2014;the impressive emotional wreckedness of &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds81S61UvPA">Coming Around Again</a>,&quot; the synth-sloggy &#x2019;80s hit Simon sang from the perspective of a housewife who&#x2019;s given up hope, a song that basically depicted the institution of marriage as a minimum-security prison of the soul. (Or that&#x2019;s how it&#x2019;s always sounded to us, anyway. We sometimes think that hearing this song&#x2014;which was really popular, despite being incredibly depressing&#x2014;on pop radio about seventeen thousand times at an impressionable age did more to make us gun-shy about long-term commitment than our own parents&#x2019; divorce; there was something about the harmonies on the &quot;Burn the souflee/Scream a lullaby&quot; verse that we found absolutely terrifying.)</p><p data-reactid=".bpdqnp6k1s.1.1.0.0.4.h">More importantly, though, it&#x2019;s not like we don&#x2019;t already know that Warren Beatty and Mick Jagger were not super-conscientious boyfriends in the early &#x2019;70s. The song turning out to be about Geffen was the closest thing this mystery could have had to a man-bites-dog ending. &quot;The fact that &quot;You&#x2019;re So Vain&quot; is about business (as opposed to pleasure) suddenly makes that song about 10 times more original,&quot; said <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201003/pavement-indie">occasional GQ contributor</a> and friend of this blog Chuck Klosterman, also on Twitter. This, at the time, seemed totally right-on. There are millions of songs about faithless lovers; the my-label-should-have-promoted-me-better lament doesn&#x2019;t become a viable pop genre until the advent of hip-hop and/or Aimee Mann. More importantly, if it was a song about the music industry, it was kind of a song about Carly Simon&#x2019;s vanity, right? About her belief that Geffen should have, we dunno, placed more trade ads for her album or shipped more cardboard Carly Simon stand-ups to record stores or not flown up to Nova Scotia instead of taking her phone call&#x2014;and maybe, also, her belief that she was as good as Joni Mitchell. (If Geffen was neglecting Simon, it probably had less to do with him or her and more to do with Mitchell&#x2014;we can debate whether or not she&#x2019;s ten times the singer/songwriter Carly Simon is, but based on everything we&#x2019;ve ever read about her it&#x2019;s hard to imagine that she&#x2019;s not a ten-thousand-times-squeakier wheel, artist/label-relationship-wise. Incidentally, the second single off Court &amp; Spark? &quot;Free Man In Paris,&quot; a song Mitchell <a href="http://www.blender.com/guide/67617/greatest-songs-ever-free-man-in-paris.html">has confirmed</a> is about&#x2014;you guessed it&#x2014;David Geffen, with whom she had the kind of platonic relationship that the Facebook status-designator &quot;It&#x2019;s Complicated&quot; would someday be invented to describe.)</p><p data-reactid=".bpdqnp6k1s.1.1.0.0.4.i">The above-mentioned Wikipedia page reminded us that Carly Simon has dined out, kind of annoyingly, on the whole &quot;You&#x2019;re So Vain&quot; mystery for years, seeding the press with clues and hints and non-denial denials, revealing a letter here and a letter there. It would obviously be cooler if she&#x2019;d never said anything, but we&#x2019;re not going to fault her&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve gotta do something to compete as Carly Simon in an iCarly world. (Also, she kinda needs to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/arts/music/12simon.html">sell some records</a>.) The larger issue here, to the extremely limited extent that there is one, is that the scoopy, spoiler-happy times in which we live will eventually dissolve every interesting pop-cultural ambiguity, and that makes us sad. Does anybody really like Alanis Morrissette&#x2019;s &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; more now that we know it&#x2019;s about oral-sexing Uncle Joey from Full House? Would it add anything to our enjoyment of &quot;I Would Do Anything For Love (But I Won&#x2019;t Do That)&quot; if it turned out Meat Loaf was singing about his reluctance to watch ice-dancing? We don&#x2019;t want to get all JJ Abrams about this, but sometimes the fun is in the not-knowing. And as a culture we&#x2019;re so addicted to meaningless closure that we&#x2019;re ruining everything for ourselves.
