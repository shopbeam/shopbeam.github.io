  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFrom a chair on a bare stage, Cosby walks us through the life of the American male, from childhood to parenthood. A pioneering sitcom takes shape before our eyes, and Cosby is reborn as a nation\u0027s iconic exasperated dad. Thirty years ago this week, the comic\u0027s legendary concert film premiered in theaters. GQ asked seven top comedians to explain why you need to see it.\u000A\u000ALarry Wilmore\u000A\u000A It\u0027s clear that the concert is the template for The Cosby Show. It\u0027s kind of strikingly personal, I think, when you look at it now all those pictures of his family during the opening montage. To me, the ultimate line in \u0022Himself\u0022—and it\u0027s not really a joke, it\u0027s what we all heard as kids: \u0022I brought you into this world, I\u0027ll take you out of it.\u0022 But Cosby added a brilliant line to it: \u0022And I can make another one just like you.\u0022 Five years earlier you had Richard Pryor with Live in Concert. Here\u0027s the difference between the two concerts: Pryor talked about his mouth being sore from giving oral sex to a woman. Then five years later Bill Cosby talked about his mouth being sore from going to the dentist. Which could\u0027ve been done 30 years earlier. That\u0027s five years after Pryor breaks, just shatters, what standup is. Looking back at it, Himself was retro even when it came out—and beautiful in its simplicity. But as good as Richard Pryor: Live in Concert is, the Cosby thing, as a piece of standup, I think, is even better. I don\u0027t think there was a better one before it, and I don\u0027t think there\u0027s been a better one since.\u000A\u000AJerry Seinfeld\u000A\u000A Pryor was the first comedian to release concert movies. It had not been done before, and I always had the feeling that this was Cosby\u0027s attempt to do a similar thing. Even though he was a clean comedian and Pryor was a comedian who used any language he wanted, what was so impressive to me was it was as funny as the Pryor movies.\u000A\u000ASarah Silverman\u000A\u000A It was simply shot. No big camera moves, no set at all, just a background of very subtly changing color. The shot was tight. The camera pulled out wide only when his bits were physical and the audience needed to see a full-body shot. All the magic came from his performance, from his face. I loved that.\u000A\u000AWilmore\u000A\u000A Himself was a change for Cosby. Up until that moment he was always talking from the point of view of the child in relationship to his parents. In Himself, he became the adult. The dentist routine is one of the funniest routines ever. I\u0027ll never forget when I first heard him doing the lip-falling [of a patient under an oral anesthetic]—the Abbuh-buh, adubuh-duh—and he\u0027s getting mad trying to talk. I mean, I was just crying laughing. Here\u0027s Cosby\u0027s other genius—and he did this early on. He would make the sounds of what he was telling you so you\u0027d relive it. He always had the Official Voice [in deep voice]—\u0022I\u0027M GOING TO DO THIS!\u0022—and the Helpless Voice [high-pitched]—\u0022Oh, no!\u0022 So you always had this play going on in front of you. Pryor adopted that. Comics still do it today.\u000A\u000ARay Romano\u000A\u000A Another one that just cracked me up was when he did the whole story about Jeffrey and his mother on the airplane. The kid won\u0027t shut up and the kid\u0027s cute but he\u0027s bothering everybody and it\u0027s such a big buildup. When the mother gets off the plane and sees the husband waiting for her she punches him in the face! It\u0027s the perfect way to say it—\u0022Don\u0027t leave me with this kid again!\u0022—and she doesn\u0027t have to use any words. Cosby is a really great actor, he can mimic everything—the kid, the mother, whatever. He\u0027s in the moment as he\u0027s telling that story and the audience reads it in his face and his demeanor, his everything, and they\u0027re thinking along with him.\u000A\u000AHannibal Buress\u000A\u000A It\u0027s stuff that holds up. All of it is evergreen. He talks about asking somebody, \u0022Why do you do cocaine?\u0022 \u0022Because it intensifies your personality.\u0022 Cosby says, \u0022What if you\u0027re an asshole?\u0022  I think it\u0027s the only time he curses during the whole special. There\u0027ve been times when I\u0027ve had to work clean where I take the \u0022fucks\u0022 out of a joke and see if the joke still holds up. That\u0027s a good ercise to make sure people are laughing at the actual content and not at the profanity. It definitely is tough to work clean. If I had to do an hour clean now, I don\u0027t know how I\u0027d pull it off.\u000A\u000APatton Oswalt\u000A\u000A I was just another teenager growing up in suburbia. I\u0027d heard all his albums and was a big fan. But to see him visually doing what he was doing, that was a big deal. Up to that point a lot of the standup I\u0027d watched was very frenetic and they would run around onstage and be very active. He was sitting down but even more in control because of that. He was kind of controlling the volume of what he was doing and the impact of what he was saying.\u000A\u000ASeinfeld\u000A\u000A I had never seen anyone use a chair before—in the middle of a standup set, to sit down in a chair, in the middle of the stage. Sometimes you\u0027d have so-called Beat comedians, they would sit on a stool—maybe Lenny [Bruce] would do that. In fact I\u0027m thinking there\u0027s probably some scenes in the Dustin Hoffman movie where he\u0027s in some little smoky coffeehouse in the Village and he\u0027s sitting on a stool in that Beat style. But this is not that. This is a stage in a theater, and to sit down on a chair was an incredibly confident move. Most comedians would say that standing up and performing to a seated audience is 90 percent of the advantage you have over them! That, and the fact that you have a microphone. Of course it did not diminish his power in the slightest. In fact it seemed to add to it. Just imagine yourself in a living room at a gathering of people and everyone\u0027s sitting around, and one person in the living room stands up and says, \u0022I\u0027ll tell you this—\u0022 Well, everyone\u0027s gonna suddenly be quiet and turn and listen to that person because they\u0027re standing and everyone else is sitting. I\u0027m sure even in the Paleozoic Era, that worked: Standing has power. Sitting does not.\u000A\u000AEric Andre\u000A\u000A I couldn\u0027t stop admiring his mic technique. That\u0027s a thing that comics zero in on but civilians don\u0027t—the way he sat in the chair and held his microphone at his knee, like so far away from his mouth: I was like, \u0022Dude, that is the shit.\u0022 He\u0027s so comfortable. Like, it\u0027s all about finding comfort on stage and finding comfort in silences and being comfortable bombing, because when you\u0027re comfortable the audience is comfortable. And I\u0027ve never seen a level of comfort that high until I saw that special. Just him sitting in the chair and having the microphone on his knee, I was like, \u0022Fuuuck, I have so much farther to go.\u0022\u000A\u000ARomano\u000A\u000A I\u0027m in the business, I\u0027ve been doing standup for, oh boy, almost twenty-five years. I know all the tricks. It\u0027s like magicians: we know the trick, we know what\u0027s going on. I know it! I\u0027m aware of it! I do it! And yet I swear I feel like Bill is just telling this story for the first time, like he\u0027s just having a conversation with you.\u000A\u000AOswalt\u000A\u000A I loved the way the jokes build about putting the kids to bed at night. He describes it almost like a soccer game. He\u0027s not worried about, \u0022O.K., I gotta get to one punchline here.\u0022 He keeps telling the story and there\u0027s a bunch of different punchlines along the way, rather than \u0022I\u0027m gonna tell this one quick thing and, boom, there\u0027ll be one laugh.\u0022 There\u0027s eighty laughs in that thing. But none of them end the story. They\u0027re just a laugh along the way and it\u0027s brilliant.\u000A\u000ASeinfeld\u000A\u000A Most comedians don\u0027t work in the kind of format where you get one idea and it\u0027s twenty minutes long. Most comedians get an idea and it\u0027s ninety seconds long, until they\u0027ve said everything they want to say about it. With a really good comedian—three minutes, four minutes on one idea? That\u0027s a lot.\u000A\u000ABuress\u000A\u000A Telling stories is hard. I\u0027ve done that, where I\u0027ve been in the middle of a five-or six-minute story and I can tell it\u0027s not working and then I just have to go all the way through with a long story that the crowd isn\u0027t into. Or I can just bail on it, which is worse.\u000A\u000ASeinfeld\u000A\u000A What you were seeing here was a guy who could go through so many layers of rock in exploring a comedic premise. All his bits, they\u0027re so detailed and developed. He paints murals as opposed to pictures, and that\u0027s what really separates him. Not only do you have to have that comedic skill but you also have a tremendous gift of stage presence to hold the audience\u0027s attention that long. Comedians, we don\u0027t take pauses like him. If I took a pause like that, by the time I started talking again half the room would be empty. But the audience has such natural confidence in him, and he has in himself, and that\u0027s a bond. That they\u0027re gonna wait. They trust him. They know he\u0027s taking them somewhere good. That\u0027s when you can take a pause like that.\u000A\u000ARomano\u000A\u000A I wouldn\u0027t believe it unless I saw his notes that he actually rehearsed this and thought of this and added this line and then honed it, because it feels like he\u0027s just talking extemporaneously. And that\u0027s the trick, and he\u0027s the best at it.\u000A\u000ASeinfeld\u000A\u000A The reason comedians tell so many jokes in succession is that\u0027s how we hold the audience\u0027s attention. Think of Rodney Dangerfield. Your attention doesn\u0027t wander because there\u0027s another punchline coming every twenty seconds. That\u0027s a basic comedic principle. Richard Pryor was doing the same thing as Cosby. It certainly put those two guys on a level way above everybody else. They separated themselves completely.\u000A\u000ARomano\u000A\u000A I know his philosophy on [cursing], that it is kind of a crutch, and I guess to some extent that\u0027s true. I think the reason Bill is so revered and so good is because he doesn\u0027t need it and I don\u0027t think the audience would even accept it from him. I don\u0027t hold it against comics that do it, but I do get turned off when it doesn\u0027t feel organic or it doesn\u0027t feel part of the bit. You can almost get desensitized to it. I feel like they should edit themselves and they\u0027re maybe not even aware of it. It\u0027s like when you grade a high dive: Cosby gets higher grades than everybody, because of the degree of difficulty—being as funny as he always was, to all types of audience.\u000A\u000ASeinfeld\u000A\u000A It\u0027s organic. You just kinda know what fits you. It\u0027s just like trying on jackets in a men\u0027s store. When you look in the mirror and you go, \u0022I like this one.\u0022\u000A\u000AOswalt\u000A\u000A But\u0027s he\u0027s always had darkness in his act. His dad sounds like kind of a violent guy, and in Himself, when he talks about his grandmother being sweet to his kids, he\u0027s like, \u0022That\u0027s just a really mean woman trying to get to Heaven.\u0022\u000A\u000AAndre\u000A\u000A He\u0027s kinda sexist [in Himself]. He\u0027s like, \u0022I wanted a son instead of a daughter.\u0022 It was like, Whoa! It was interesting to see. He\u0027s known for being a Mr. Clean, so you feel like his edginess is more important. It\u0027s like he\u0027s saving it up. When he\u0027s the least bit dirty or edgy it\u0027s like he means it, it\u0027s like it\u0027s coming out of him—like he can\u0027t not be edgy.\u000A\u000ARomano\u000A\u000A There\u0027s an edge of he\u0027s put-upon. He\u0027s put-upon by his kids, by the people who want to party, by the people who want to do drugs. I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s a misanthrope, but it\u0027s funny how he openly talks about how his kids are such a pain to him, and yet you can see through it, you know that it\u0027s through love, so he can get away with it. We love our family and we would do it all over again but they drive us crazy. I do a whole bit about my wife refusing to answer any stupid questions, and there\u0027s an exact line that he said: \u0022If you ask me one more stupid question I\u0027m going to get the shotgun and shoot you in the face.\u0022 Watching Himself again this week, I almost accused myself of stealing from him!\u000A\u000ASeinfeld\u000A\u000A People understood comedy much better in those days than they do now. Now they think that these things that you say onstage are opinions, and then they understood that they were jokes, and jokes have only one desired result, and that is to amuse. It\u0027s words assembled to amuse, that\u0027s what a joke is. An opinion is something you really think, and people have lost that thread. We\u0027ve somehow confused comedians with politicians. We think these things mean something. They don\u0027t. I saw Don Rickles last week, and you know, he caught flak for an Obama joke—some joke about Obama being a custodian or something at the White House, you know. The kind of joke that he\u0027s done his entire career. And now suddenly people think it means something. Like this is some opinion or actual political position. It\u0027s neither.\u000A\u000ARomano\u000A\u000A I watched Bill the other night on Letterman. He came out and he sat down and I was just amazed how he doesn\u0027t even say anything and you\u0027re just drawn in. He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story. He created that. He created the whole idea of taking a quote-unquote \u0022comic\u0022 and developing a TV show just from a persona that you see onstage.\u000A\u000AAndre\u000A\u000A My dad\u0027s a black doctor, and The Cosby Show came out right around when my Dad got his doctorate and started practicing medicine, and I think my Dad considered changing his last name to Huxtable. So I have an emotional attachment to The Cosby Show. Himself brought context to me: I understood The Cosby Show completely. It was like the first time I did acid, I totally understood Ren &amp; Stimpy. I saw him at the Apollo live a few years ago and same thing. He was in the chair, he had a box of tissues, he\u0027d blow his nose after every joke... But he\u0027s like Dad, man. Bill Cosby\u0027s like Dad and Richard Pryor\u0027s like your dirty old uncle. You know what I mean? Uncle Richard would, like, sneak you beers and give you firecrackers at Thanksgiving. Bill Cosby is like every comedian\u0027s father.",

bare stage, Cosby walks us through the life of the American male, from childhood to parenthood. A pioneering sitcom takes shape before our eyes, and Cosby is reborn as a nation&#x2019;s iconic exasperated dad. Thirty years ago this week, the comic&#x2019;s legendary concert film premiered in theaters. GQ asked seven top comedians to explain why you need to see it.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>Larry Wilmore</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.3"> It&#x2019;s clear that the concert is the template for <em>The Cosby Show</em>. It&#x2019;s kind of strikingly personal, I think, when you look at it now all those pictures of his family during the opening montage. To me, the ultimate line in &quot;Himself&quot;&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s not really a joke, it&#x2019;s what we all heard as kids: &quot;I brought you into this world, I&#x2019;ll take you out of it.&quot; But Cosby added a brilliant line to it: &quot;And I can make another one just like you.&quot; Five years earlier you had Richard Pryor with <em>Live in Concert</em>. Here&#x2019;s the difference between the two concerts: Pryor talked about his mouth being sore from giving oral sex to a woman. Then five years later Bill Cosby talked about his mouth being sore from <em>going to the dentist</em>. Which could&#x2019;ve been done 30 years earlier. That&#x2019;s five years after Pryor breaks, just shatters, what standup is. Looking back at it, <em>Himself</em> was retro even when it came out&#x2014;and beautiful in its simplicity. But as good as <em>Richard Pryor: Live in Concert</em> is, the Cosby thing, as a piece of standup, I think, is even better. I don&#x2019;t think there was a better one before it, and I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s been a better one since.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Jerry Seinfeld</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.6"> Pryor was the first comedian to release concert movies. It had not been done before, and I always had the feeling that this was Cosby&#x2019;s attempt to do a similar thing. Even though he was a clean comedian and Pryor was a comedian who used any language he wanted, what was so impressive to me was it was as funny as the Pryor movies.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Sarah Silverman</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.8"> It was simply shot. No big camera moves, no set at all, just a background of very subtly changing color. The shot was tight. The camera pulled out wide only when his bits were physical and the audience needed to see a full-body shot. All the magic came from his performance, from his face. I loved that.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>Wilmore</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.a"> <em>Himself</em> was a change for Cosby. Up until that moment he was always talking from the point of view of the child in relationship to his parents. In <em>Himself</em>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qY6cJD3CE">he became the adult.</a> The dentist routine is one of the funniest routines ever. I&#x2019;ll never forget when I first heard him doing the lip-falling [of a patient under an oral anesthetic]&#x2014;the <em>Abbuh-buh, adubuh-duh&#x2014;</em>and he&#x2019;s getting mad trying to talk. I mean, I was just crying laughing. Here&#x2019;s Cosby&#x2019;s other genius&#x2014;and he did this early on. He would make the sounds of what he was telling you so you&#x2019;d relive it. He always had the Official Voice [<em>in deep voice</em>]&#x2014;&quot;I&#x2019;M GOING TO DO THIS!&quot;&#x2014;and the Helpless Voice <em>[high-pitched]</em>&#x2014;&quot;Oh, no!&quot; So you always had this play going on in front of you. Pryor adopted that. Comics still do it today.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Ray Romano</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Another one that just cracked me up was when he did <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc6j5oL9fIw">the whole story about Jeffrey and his mother on the airplane</a>. The kid won&#x2019;t shut up and the kid&#x2019;s cute but he&#x2019;s bothering everybody and it&#x2019;s such a big buildup. When the mother gets off the plane and sees the husband waiting for her she punches him in the face! It&#x2019;s the perfect way to say it&#x2014;&quot;Don&#x2019;t leave me with this kid again!&quot;&#x2014;and she doesn&#x2019;t have to use any words. Cosby is a really great actor, he can mimic everything&#x2014;the kid, the mother, whatever. He&#x2019;s in the moment as he&#x2019;s telling that story and the audience reads it in his face and his demeanor, his everything, and they&#x2019;re thinking along with him.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Hannibal Buress</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.e"> It&#x2019;s stuff that holds up. All of it is evergreen. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=achFxzgS0gE">He talks about asking somebody, &quot;Why do you do cocaine?&quot;</a> &quot;Because it intensifies your personality.&quot; Cosby says, &quot;What if you&#x2019;re an asshole?&quot;  I think it&#x2019;s the only time he curses during the whole special. There&#x2019;ve been times when I&#x2019;ve had to work clean where I take the &quot;fucks&quot; out of a joke and see if the joke still holds up. That&#x2019;s a good ercise to make sure people are laughing at the actual content and not at the profanity. It definitely is tough to work clean. If I had to do an hour clean now, I don&#x2019;t know how I&#x2019;d pull it off.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Patton Oswalt</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.g"> I was just another teenager growing up in suburbia. I&#x2019;d heard all his albums and was a big fan. But to see him visually doing what he was doing, that was a big deal. Up to that point a lot of the standup I&#x2019;d watched was very frenetic and they would run around onstage and be very active. He was sitting down but even more in control <em>because</em> of that. He was kind of controlling the volume of what he was doing and the impact of what he was saying.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>Seinfeld</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.i"> I had never seen anyone use a chair before&#x2014;in the middle of a standup set, to sit down in a chair, in the middle of the stage. Sometimes you&#x2019;d have so-called Beat comedians, they would sit on a stool&#x2014;maybe Lenny [Bruce] would do that. In fact I&#x2019;m thinking there&#x2019;s probably some scenes in the Dustin Hoffman movie where he&#x2019;s in some little smoky coffeehouse in the Village and he&#x2019;s sitting on a stool in that Beat style. But this is not that. This is a stage in a theater, and to sit down on a chair was an incredibly confident move. Most comedians would say that standing up and performing to a seated audience is 90 percent of the advantage you have over them! That, and the fact that you have a microphone. Of course it did not diminish his power in the slightest. In fact it seemed to add to it. Just imagine yourself in a living room at a gathering of people and everyone&#x2019;s sitting around, and one person in the living room stands up and says, &quot;I&#x2019;ll tell you this&#x2014;&quot; Well, everyone&#x2019;s gonna suddenly be quiet and turn and listen to that person because they&#x2019;re standing and everyone else is sitting. I&#x2019;m sure even in the Paleozoic Era, that worked: Standing has power. Sitting does not.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>Eric Andre</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.k"> I couldn&#x2019;t stop admiring his mic technique. That&#x2019;s a thing that comics zero in on but civilians don&#x2019;t&#x2014;the way he sat in the chair and held his microphone at his knee, like so far away from his mouth: I was like, &quot;Dude, that is the <em>shit</em>.&quot; He&#x2019;s so comfortable. Like, it&#x2019;s all about finding comfort on stage and finding comfort in silences and being comfortable bombing, because when you&#x2019;re comfortable the audience is comfortable. And I&#x2019;ve never seen a level of comfort that high until I saw that special. Just him sitting in the chair and having the microphone on his knee, I was like, &quot;<em>Fuuuck</em>, I have so much farther to go.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>Romano</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.m"> I&#x2019;m in the business, I&#x2019;ve been doing standup for, oh boy, almost twenty-five years. I know all the tricks. It&#x2019;s like magicians: we know the trick, we know what&#x2019;s going on. I know it! I&#x2019;m aware of it! I do it! And yet I swear I feel like Bill is just telling this story for the first time, like he&#x2019;s just having a conversation with you.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>Oswalt</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.o"> I loved the way the jokes build about putting the kids to bed at night. He describes it almost like a soccer game. He&#x2019;s not worried about, &quot;O.K., I gotta get to one punchline here.&quot; He keeps telling the story and there&#x2019;s a bunch of different punchlines along the way, rather than &quot;I&#x2019;m gonna tell this one quick thing and, boom, there&#x2019;ll be one laugh.&quot; There&#x2019;s <em>eighty</em> laughs in that thing. But none of them end the story. They&#x2019;re just a laugh along the way and it&#x2019;s brilliant.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>Seinfeld</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.q"> Most comedians don&#x2019;t work in the kind of format where you get one idea and it&#x2019;s twenty minutes long. Most comedians get an idea and it&#x2019;s ninety seconds long, until they&#x2019;ve said everything they want to say about it. With a really good comedian&#x2014;three minutes, four minutes on one idea? That&#x2019;s a <em>lot</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>Buress</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.s"> Telling stories is hard. I&#x2019;ve done that, where I&#x2019;ve been in the middle of a five-or six-minute story and I can tell it&#x2019;s not working and then I just have to go all the way through with a long story that the crowd isn&#x2019;t into. Or I can just bail on it, which is worse.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>Seinfeld</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.u"> What you were seeing here was a guy who could go through so many layers of rock in exploring a comedic premise. All his bits, they&#x2019;re so detailed and developed. He paints murals as opposed to pictures, and that&#x2019;s what really separates him. Not only do you have to have that comedic skill but you also have a tremendous gift of stage presence to hold the audience&#x2019;s attention that long. Comedians, we don&#x2019;t take pauses like him. If I took a pause like that, by the time I started talking again half the room would be empty. But the audience has such natural confidence in him, and he has in himself, and that&#x2019;s a bond. That they&#x2019;re gonna wait. They trust him. They know he&#x2019;s taking them somewhere good. That&#x2019;s when you can take a pause like that.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>Romano</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.w"> I wouldn&#x2019;t believe it unless I saw his notes that he actually rehearsed this and thought of this and added this line and then honed it, because it feels like he&#x2019;s just talking extemporaneously. And that&#x2019;s the trick, and he&#x2019;s the best at it.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>Seinfeld</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.y"> The reason comedians tell so many jokes in succession is that&#x2019;s how we hold the audience&#x2019;s attention. Think of Rodney Dangerfield. Your attention doesn&#x2019;t wander because there&#x2019;s another punchline coming every twenty seconds. That&#x2019;s a basic comedic principle. Richard Pryor was doing the same thing as Cosby. It certainly put those two guys on a level <em>way</em> above everybody else. They separated themselves completely.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>Romano</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.10"> I know his philosophy on [cursing], that it is kind of a crutch, and I guess to some extent that&#x2019;s true. I think the reason Bill is so revered and so good is because he doesn&#x2019;t need it and I don&#x2019;t think the audience would even accept it from him. I don&#x2019;t hold it against comics that do it, but I do get turned off when it doesn&#x2019;t feel organic or it doesn&#x2019;t feel part of the bit. You can almost get desensitized to it. I feel like they should edit themselves and they&#x2019;re maybe not even aware of it. It&#x2019;s like when you grade a high dive: Cosby gets higher grades than everybody, because of the degree of difficulty&#x2014;being as funny as he always was, to all types of audience.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong>Seinfeld</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.12"> It&#x2019;s organic. You just kinda know what fits you. It&#x2019;s just like trying on jackets in a men&#x2019;s store. When you look in the mirror and you go, &quot;I like this one.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>Oswalt</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.14"> But&#x2019;s he&#x2019;s always had darkness in his act. His dad sounds like kind of a violent guy, and in <em>Himself</em>, when he talks about his grandmother being sweet to his kids, he&#x2019;s like, &quot;That&#x2019;s just a really mean woman trying to get to Heaven.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>Andre</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.16"> He&#x2019;s kinda sexist [in <em>Himself</em>]. He&#x2019;s like, &quot;I wanted a son instead of a daughter.&quot; It was like, <em>Whoa!</em> It was interesting to see. He&#x2019;s known for being a Mr. Clean, so you feel like his edginess is more important. It&#x2019;s like he&#x2019;s saving it up. When he&#x2019;s the least bit dirty or edgy it&#x2019;s like he <em>means</em> it, it&#x2019;s like it&#x2019;s coming out of him&#x2014;like he can&#x2019;t not be edgy.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.17"><strong>Romano</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.18"> There&#x2019;s an edge of he&#x2019;s put-upon. He&#x2019;s put-upon by his kids, by the people who want to party, by the people who want to do drugs. I don&#x2019;t know if he&#x2019;s a misanthrope, but it&#x2019;s funny how he openly talks about how his kids are such a pain to him, and yet you can see through it, you know that it&#x2019;s through love, so he can get away with it. We love our family and we would do it all over again but they drive us crazy. I do a whole bit about my wife refusing to answer any stupid questions, and there&#x2019;s an exact line that he said: &quot;If you ask me one more stupid question I&#x2019;m going to get the shotgun and shoot you in the face.&quot; Watching <em>Himself</em> again this week, I almost accused myself of stealing from him!</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.19"><strong>Seinfeld</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> People understood comedy much better in those days than they do now. Now they think that these things that you say onstage are opinions, and then they understood that they were jokes, and jokes have only one desired result, and that is to amuse. It&#x2019;s words assembled to amuse, that&#x2019;s what a joke is. An opinion is something you really think, and people have lost that thread. We&#x2019;ve somehow confused comedians with politicians. We think these things mean something. They don&#x2019;t. I saw Don Rickles last week, and you know, he caught flak for an Obama joke&#x2014;some joke about Obama being a custodian or something at the White House, you know. The kind of joke that he&#x2019;s done his entire career. And now suddenly people think it means something. Like this is some opinion or actual political position. It&#x2019;s neither.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><strong>Romano</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> I watched Bill the other night on <em>Letterman</em>. He came out and he sat down and I was just amazed how he doesn&#x2019;t even say anything and you&#x2019;re just drawn in. He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story. He created that. He created the whole idea of taking a quote-unquote &quot;comic&quot; and developing a TV show just from a persona that you see onstage.</p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><strong>Andre</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> My dad&#x2019;s a black doctor, and <em>The Cosby Show</em> came out right around when my Dad got his doctorate and started practicing medicine, and I think my Dad considered changing his last name to Huxtable. So I have an emotional attachment to <em>The Cosby Show</em>. <em>Himself</em> brought context to me: I understood <em>The Cosby Show</em> completely. It was like the first time I did acid, I totally understood <em>Ren &amp; Stimpy</em>. I saw him at the Apollo live a few years ago and same thing. He was in the chair, he had a box of tissues, he&#x2019;d blow his nose after every joke... But he&#x2019;s like Dad, man. Bill Cosby&#x2019;s like Dad and Richard Pryor&#x2019;s like your dirty old uncle. You know what I mean? Uncle Richard would, like, sneak you beers and give you firecrackers at Thanksgiving. Bill Cosby is like every comedian&#x2019;s father.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1if3us34zk0.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
