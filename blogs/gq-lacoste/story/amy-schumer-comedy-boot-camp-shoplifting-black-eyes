  	    "articleBody": "Saying the things that people won\u0027t say, and telling the stories that people don\u0027t tell, lies at the center of what Amy Schumer does. She applies the same merciless rigor to her own life, both in the material from which she fashions much of her comedy, and in how she talks about herself and her life offstage.\u000A\u000A Here, for example, are three conversations with her about life before she became famous that took place during our interviews for her forthcoming GQ cover story—three conversations it is difficult to imagine taking place with many, if any, other modern celebrities.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AON SHOPLIFTING:\u000A\u000AWhen you were young, you had a whole unusual fondness for shoplifting, didn\u0027t you?Is it unusual? Actually, I think it\u0027s pretty typical of white girls.\u000A\u000AWell, doing some shoplifting may be typical. But it sounds like you did a bit more than that.Yes. I started just with my girlfriends—we would steal a bathing suit or some makeup or I don\u0027t know—and then I just got more serious about it. It became grand larceny when I was in college. I just discovered this department store where you could just take whatever and then return it for cash—no tags, no receipt, nothing. You know, thousands of dollars. It was exciting. It was the adrenaline—the actual act of getting away with it. It wasn\u0027t about the money, even though the money was nice. And I didn\u0027t feel bad about it—it was this huge corporation. You know, I never stole from people. I never stole from a little store.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve said you might have stolen about $100,000 worth of stuff overall.Sure. Yeah.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s…It\u0027s a lot. Yeah. I was stealing, like, age 14 to 21? I think I was arrested when I was 21. I got arrested stealing from Bloomingdale\u0027s with my sister—which I\u0027d never stolen from before but Kim was like, \u0022It\u0027s really easy,\u0022 and then we found out it\u0027s the hardest place to shoplift from—and they kind of got it down to disturbing the peace, but if anybody dug into my record they would see that it was grand larceny.\u000A\u000AWhat was the punishment?Shit, what was it? Community service? A fine? I don\u0027t remember. But I just remember I was, \u0022I don\u0027t want to go to jail.\u0022 It felt really bad, being arrested. You have no say. And it was embarrassing. I was relieved because I got caught doing this other thing—had they caught me for the thing I\u0027d been doing for years and years, I would probably have had to do time. So, relieved actually. But it sucked.\u000A\u000AWas it easy for you to stop after that?No. I missed it. It was a physical longing. It was hard. I don\u0027t ever get impulses anymore. It\u0027s been years.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AON HER COMEDY BOOT CAMP:\u000A\u000AWhen you\u0027ve talked your childhood and youth, you\u0027ve detailed uncomfortable and difficult things that happened.\u000A\u000AYeah. After my dad got MS and we went bankrupt and my mom left him, that period from age 12 to 15 was a really rough time. And we all suffered from it, my siblings and I. It was just a major struggle, more so than most kids should ever have to deal with. [Pause] We weren\u0027t beaten. We weren\u0027t molested.\u000A\u000AHow did whatever happened then affect you?It made me fearless and unbreakable and so strong. And a leader and maternal.\u000A\u000ADid you realize it was making you like that at the time?Yeah. I was like \u0022I\u0027m a badass.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd is it too trite to see a very direct line from that into what you do now?No. Very clear. Especially the taking so much pain and making it into something to laugh at. That was my boot camp, those ages. I\u0027ve just been in training to do everything I\u0027m doing right now.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s fascinating that so much comedy we cherish comes from such an unfunny place.It\u0027s true. I think all comedians had a lot of pain in their lives. Like, a solid amount of pain at a sensitive time in their lives. I don\u0027t know anyone who didn\u0027t. A lot of male comics, it\u0027s just \u0022My dad wasn\u0027t nice to me…didn\u0027t tell me he loved me.\u0022 And that\u0027s enough. I think that\u0027s totally enough. But our family got a hundred extra helpings of that. [She points to a photo on her mantelpiece of herself and her father, both much younger, posing at the beach with arms round each other\u0027s shoulders.] I\u0027m lucky—my dad did love me. We used to body surf a lot together.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AON FAKE BLACK EYES:\u000A\u000AI\u0027m fascinated by this thing you and your sister used to do when you\u0027d go to Rangers games.And give ourselves black eyes?  \u000A\u000AYes.[laughs] Did you see any pictures of it? [She scrolls through her phone and shows me a picture of them together with matching made-up, but realistic-looking, black eyes.] And then we had some where we wore neck braces. Jon Hamm saw us at one Ranger game years ago—he definitely didn\u0027t know who I was—and seeing Jon Hamm look at us like, \u0022Oh my God…\u0022 [laughs]\u000A\u000ASo how did that start?Well, I liked going out with a black eye. People really leave you alone. We thought it was hilarious because it\u0027s not one person that got fucked up, it\u0027s two. We would tell people that we got into something with each other. We just thought it was so funny. It makes people really uncomfortable. I like being all dressed up but then you\u0027re just, like, wearing a neck brace—just like a swing and a miss. Makes me laugh so hard. It feels kind of powerful to me to own something that awful to look at. It feels kind of empowering.\u000A\u000AThis was before many people would recognize you?Totally.\u000A\u000AHow many times did you do that?That I\u0027ve left the house with a fake black eye? [Considers this] Fifteen? I went to Heidi Klum\u0027s Halloween party—Questlove was DJing and my sister and I were all dressed up, we looked beautiful, and the last minute I gave myself a black eye. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s normal, but I also swear I don\u0027t do it to be interesting. It just feels good. It\u0027s fun. It\u0027s just like a little social experiment.\u000A\u000AAre the results in yet?Yeah. Everyone is grossed out and doesn\u0027t want to look at you or talk to you. But the people who do—who go \u0022What happened to you guys?\u0022—I just love those people, because they weren\u0027t afraid to have an awkward moment. They had a question and they just asked it.\u000A\u000AThat sounds like a good description of your ideal audience—people who aren\u0027t afraid to have an awkward moment.Definitely. I don\u0027t mind if they came a little afraid and leave a little different. That\u0027s my hope.",

of what Amy Schumer does. She applies the same merciless rigor to her own life, both in the material from which she fashions much of her comedy, and in how she talks about herself and her life offstage.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.1"> Here, for example, are three conversations with her about life before she became famous that took place during our interviews for her forthcoming GQ cover story&#x2014;three conversations it is difficult to imagine taking place with many, if any, other modern celebrities.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.2"><hr></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.3"><h2>ON SHOPLIFTING:</h2></div><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>When you were young, you had a whole unusual fondness for shoplifting, didn&apos;t you?</strong><br>Is it unusual? Actually, I think it&apos;s pretty typical of white girls.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Well, doing some shoplifting may be typical. But it sounds like you did a bit more than that.</strong><br>Yes. I started just with my girlfriends&#x2014;we would steal a bathing suit or some makeup or I don&apos;t know&#x2014;and then I just got more serious about it. It became grand larceny when I was in college. I just discovered this department store where you could just take whatever and then return it for cash&#x2014;no tags, no receipt, nothing. You know, thousands of dollars. It was exciting. It was the adrenaline&#x2014;the actual act of getting away with it. It wasn&apos;t about the money, even though the money was nice. And I didn&apos;t feel bad about it&#x2014;it was this huge corporation. You know, I never stole from people. I never stole from a little store.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>You&apos;ve said you might have stolen about $100,000 worth of stuff overall.</strong><br>Sure. Yeah.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>That&apos;s&#x2026;</strong><br>It&apos;s a lot. Yeah. I was stealing, like, age 14 to 21? I think I was arrested when I was 21. I got arrested stealing from Bloomingdale&apos;s with my sister&#x2014;which I&apos;d never stolen from before but Kim was like, &quot;It&apos;s really easy,&quot; and then we found out it&apos;s the hardest place to shoplift from&#x2014;and they kind of got it down to disturbing the peace, but if anybody dug into my record they would see that it was grand larceny.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>What was the punishment?</strong><br>Shit, what was it? Community service? A fine? I don&apos;t remember. But I just remember I was, &quot;I don&apos;t want to go to jail.&quot; It felt really bad, being arrested. You have no say. And it was embarrassing. I was relieved because I got caught doing this other thing&#x2014;had they caught me for the thing I&apos;d been doing for years and years, I would probably have had to do time. So, relieved actually. But it sucked.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Was it easy for you to stop after that?</strong><br>No. I missed it. It was a physical longing. It was hard. I don&apos;t ever get impulses anymore. It&apos;s been years.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.b"><hr></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.c"><h2>ON HER COMEDY BOOT CAMP:</h2></div><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>When you&apos;ve talked your childhood and youth, you&apos;ve detailed uncomfortable and difficult things that happened.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.e">Yeah. After my dad got MS and we went bankrupt and my mom left him, that period from age 12 to 15 was a really rough time. And we all suffered from it, my siblings and I. It was just a major struggle, more so than most kids should ever have to deal with. [<em>Pause</em>] We weren&apos;t beaten. We weren&apos;t molested.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>How did whatever happened then affect you?</strong><br>It made me fearless and unbreakable and so strong. And a leader and maternal.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Did you realize it was making you like that at the time?</strong><br>Yeah. I was like &quot;I&apos;m a badass.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>And is it too trite to see a very direct line from that into what you do now?</strong><br>No. Very clear. Especially the taking so much pain and making it into something to laugh at. That was my boot camp, those ages. I&apos;ve just been in training to do everything I&apos;m doing right now.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>It&apos;s fascinating that so much comedy we cherish comes from such an unfunny place.</strong><br>It&apos;s true. I think all comedians had a lot of pain in their lives. Like, a solid amount of pain at a sensitive time in their lives. I don&apos;t know anyone who didn&apos;t. A lot of male comics, it&apos;s just &quot;My dad wasn&apos;t nice to me&#x2026;didn&apos;t tell me he loved me.&quot; And that&apos;s enough. I think that&apos;s totally enough. But our family got a hundred extra helpings of that. [<em>She points to a photo on her mantelpiece of herself and her father, both much younger, posing at the beach with arms round each other&apos;s shoulders.</em>] I&apos;m lucky&#x2014;my dad did love me. We used to body surf a lot together.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.j"><hr></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.k"><h2>ON FAKE BLACK EYES:</h2></div><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>I&apos;m fascinated by this thing you and your sister used to do when you&apos;d go to Rangers games.</strong><br>And give ourselves black eyes?  </p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Yes.</strong><br>[<em>laughs</em>] Did you see any pictures of it? [<em>She scrolls through her phone and shows me a picture of them together with matching made-up, but realistic-looking, black eyes.</em>] And then we had some where we wore neck braces. Jon Hamm saw us at one Ranger game years ago&#x2014;he definitely didn&apos;t know who I was&#x2014;and seeing Jon Hamm look at us like, &quot;Oh my God&#x2026;&quot; [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>So how did that start?</strong><br>Well, I liked going out with a black eye. People really leave you alone. We thought it was hilarious because it&apos;s not one person that got fucked up, it&apos;s two. We would tell people that we got into something with each other. We just thought it was so funny. It makes people really uncomfortable. I like being all dressed up but then you&apos;re just, like, wearing a neck brace&#x2014;just like a swing and a miss. Makes me laugh so hard. It feels kind of powerful to me to own something that awful to look at. It feels kind of empowering.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>This was before many people would recognize you?</strong><br>Totally.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>How many times did you do that?</strong><br>That I&apos;ve left the house with a fake black eye? [<em>Considers this</em>] Fifteen? I went to Heidi Klum&apos;s Halloween party&#x2014;Questlove was DJing and my sister and I were all dressed up, we looked beautiful, and the last minute I gave myself a black eye. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s normal, but I also swear I don&apos;t do it to be interesting. It just feels good. It&apos;s fun. It&apos;s just like a little social experiment.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>Are the results in yet?</strong><br>Yeah. Everyone is grossed out and doesn&apos;t want to look at you or talk to you. But the people who do&#x2014;who go &quot;What happened to you guys?&quot;&#x2014;I just love those people, because they weren&apos;t afraid to have an awkward moment. They had a question and they just asked it.</p><p data-reactid=".1leq1y0q7eo.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>That sounds like a good description of your ideal audience&#x2014;people who aren&apos;t afraid to have an awkward moment.</strong><br>Definitely. I don&apos;t mind if they came a little afraid and leave a little different.
