  	    "articleBody": "Young Thug and the football-team-sized crowd of folks who accompany him pack into a New York City recording studio. I try to tally the shiny things hanging from him: four massive rings, a watch, sunglasses, earrings, two face piercings, three bracelets, and three chains, all drenched in yellow and white diamonds. He looks like a chandelier wearing a leather jacket. He\u0027s tall—6 foot four—and rail-thin. (Rick Ross\u0027s Rolex could fit around Thug\u0027s thigh.) He is finishing-school-polite: \u0022I could never take a woman\u0027s seat…\u0022 \u0022Thank you. Thank you. How are you not married yet? You\u0027re so perfect. Thank you.\u0022 \u0022Would anyone care for some promethazine and codeine?\u0022 \u000A\u000AThug is a very necessary element in the hip-hop periodic table. Nowadays rappers are businessmen—savvy, self-aware, overly conscious of their brand. Thugger, on the other hand, is holding a pistol in one hand, tweeting with the other, high on something far stronger than weed, speaking in a language that I\u0027ll dub East Atlanta Dothraki. He\u0027s Lou Reed. He\u0027s post-thug. At any moment, we could lose him to any number of vices or vendettas. Also at any moment, we may get one of the grittiest, most hard-hitting Southern hip-hop albums since Aquemini.\u000A\u000AThe project has been delayed, but we caught up with him now, partly because trying to figure out where Young Thug will be in a few months seems futile and partly because we really, really need to know: Did he try to kill Lil Wayne?\u000A\u000AGQ: You excited about the new album?Young Thug: Not really. \u000A\u000APeople\u0027s biggest complaint is that you mumble. Does that ever get to you? It don\u0027t really get to me. When it gets to me, I\u0027ll do it worse. I\u0027ll make a whole fucking mumbling album.\u000A\u000AHow would you describe where you\u0027re from?Like the bottom of your shoes. I\u0027m from the bottom of your shoes.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re pretty weird now. Were you weird in high school?When I was in high school, I had a gambling problem. I played quarterback, and I used to have ten pairs of dice in a little bag. I never even went to the school where I was from. My dad wanted me to play football so bad, he took me to Washington High School on the west side of Atlanta because they were number one. They never lost. I played for one year, but then I started gambling again and going to other hoods. All the people in school probably thought I was weird, so I was quiet the whole time I was in school. But I always paid attention to every single thing.\u000A\u000AHow was it interacting with the girls? Were you popular with them?Of course. Yeah. Girls like the cool guys. You would\u0027ve liked the cool guy instead of the class clown, right?\u000A\u000ABut weren\u0027t you cool, though, right? Cool guys usually have a lot of friends, et cetera.Oh, you mean, like, popular cool. I was popular cool because I played varsity quarterback in the ninth grade. But I was calm because I didn\u0027t really know anyone. Every girl at school had my number spray-painted on their faces and shit. I didn\u0027t know nobody, so I was just kept to myself. \u000A\u000AWhy\u0027d you decide to connect with Birdman and Cash Money Records?Because my whole life I looked up to them. I wanted to stunt like Birdman, which I fucking am. And I wanted to be like Wayne. \u000A\u000APlain and simple: Did you try to have Lil Wayne killed?Fuck no. \u000A\u000ADoes it bother you that Wayne, one of your idols, clearly has a personal problem with you?Maybe if I was a peasant it would. But of course it bothers me some, because that\u0027s what I always wanted. It was so weird: I always wanted to be in the studio with Wayne. I would tell Birdman to bring him over, but he never fucking came.\u000A\u000AThe first time I saw you perform was five years ago... That was when I was Wayne. And he\u0027s me now. \u000A\u000AWhat do you mean?I feel like if he had the chance to be himself or me, he\u0027d be me. If I had the chance to be myself or him, I\u0027d be him. That man is the greatest. If we had the biggest problem in the world, I\u0027d still say he\u0027s the best rapper in the fucking world. Everybody knows nobody raps better than the fucking boss. \u000A\u000A How do you feel about the whole Meek Mill/Drake beef? Tough month for Meek, right?Tough month for Drake, tough life for the other guy.\u000A\u000AWhy do you wear women\u0027s clothing?Because women\u0027s clothes are [slimmer] than men\u0027s clothes. The jeans I got on right now, they\u0027re women\u0027s jeans. But they fit how they\u0027re supposed to fit. Like a rock star. The only thing I probably have in men\u0027s is, like, briefs. T-shirts. Ninety percent of my clothes are women\u0027s.\u000A\u000AWhen did you start wearing predominantly women\u0027s clothing? When I was 12 or some shit, started gambling, getting my own money. My dad wouldn\u0027t buy me tight pants. I had to get my own money to buy them.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s one thing to wear \u0022rock star\u0022 clothes when you\u0027re on stage with thousands of fans, it\u0027s another thing when you\u0027re 12 years old, shooting dice in someone else\u0027s hood. Did people fuck with you for it?Yeah, it was way more difficult. But I was so into that gangster shit. Dudes didn\u0027t play.\u000A\u000AHow do you get them not to fuck with you?How? Shoot the shit out of one of them. Beat the fuck out of them. However you have to handle it. There\u0027s no thinking [when someone disrespects you], we gotta handle it right then. So as young men, we had to do a couple things. Then people respected us. \u000A\u000AYou tote guns very openly. Are you more rock star or gangster?Ninety-nine percent of me is rock star. Of course, I\u0027m a natural-born gangster. Who don\u0027t know that?\u000A\u000AAre you ever worried...That something\u0027s gonna happen to me? Of course. I\u0027m still a human, so of course. I guess that\u0027s why I survive. I\u0027m with anything. If you want me to be a rock star onstage, that\u0027s what I\u0027m ready to die about. But if you got a gun in my face, I ain\u0027t gonna wimp out. I wanna die being a rock star. \u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s your biggest fear?Not seeing God.\u000A\u000AWhen you die? Yeah. I want to see Him, I really do. And I\u0027m afraid of my mom dying. If my mom died, I wouldn\u0027t want to do nothing. I would die. Quit.\u000A\u000AWhere does she live now?She\u0027s 51, with an enlarged heart, so at any time it could just burst or stop. But she lives somewhere in Georgia. Not a peasant can get to her. \u000A\u000AIs that the driving force behind you making so many records nonstop?Yeah. I just be like, I look at her smile. She has eleven kids; I was the tenth. None of us ever had anything. So now that we finally got a little something...it\u0027s me. \u000A\u000AGlad she kept making kids! So fucking glad she had me. I\u0027m pretty sure she\u0027s glad as fuck she had me, too.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARead More: \u000AYoung Thug\u0027s Slime Season Is Something Else Entirely, and It\u0027s ExtraordinaryYoung Thug: What Drugs Sound Like",

interesting—breakout sits down for a candid conversation about childhood, beefs, and his beloved mother</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.0"><a href="http://www.gq.com/story/young-thug">Young Thug</a> and the football-team-sized crowd of folks who accompany him pack into a New York City recording studio. I try to tally the shiny things hanging from him: four massive rings, a watch, sunglasses, earrings, two face piercings, three bracelets, and three chains, all drenched in yellow and white diamonds. He looks like a chandelier wearing a leather jacket. He&#x2019;s tall&#x2014;6 foot four&#x2014;and rail-thin. (Rick Ross&#x2019;s Rolex could fit around Thug&#x2019;s thigh.) He is finishing-school-polite: &#x201C;I could never take a woman&#x2019;s seat&#x2026;&#x201D; &#x201C;Thank you. Thank you. How are you not married yet? You&#x2019;re so perfect. Thank you.&#x201D; &#x201C;Would anyone care for some promethazine and codeine?&#x201D; </p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.1">Thug is a very necessary element in the hip-hop periodic table. Nowadays rappers are businessmen&#x2014;savvy, self-aware, overly conscious of their brand. Thugger, on the other hand, is holding a pistol in one hand, tweeting with the other, high on something far stronger than weed, speaking <a href="young-thug-slime-season-something-else-extraordinary">in a language</a> that I&#x2019;ll dub East Atlanta Dothraki. He&#x2019;s Lou Reed. He&#x2019;s post-thug. At any moment, we could lose him to any number of vices or vendettas. Also at any moment, we may get one of the grittiest, most hard-hitting Southern hip-hop albums since <em>Aquemini</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.2">The project has been delayed, but we caught up with him now, partly because trying to figure out where Young Thug will be in a few months seems futile and partly because we really, really need to know: Did he try to kill Lil Wayne?</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>GQ: You excited about the new album?</strong><br><strong>Young Thug:</strong> Not really. </p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>People&#x2019;s biggest complaint is that you mumble. Does that ever get to you?</strong> <br>It don&#x2019;t really get to me. When it gets to me, I&#x2019;ll do it worse. I&#x2019;ll make a whole fucking mumbling album.</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>How would you describe where you&#x2019;re from?</strong><br>Like the bottom of your shoes. I&#x2019;m from the bottom of your shoes.</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>You&#x2019;re pretty weird now. Were you weird in high school?</strong><br>When I was in high school, I had a gambling problem. I played quarterback, and I used to have ten pairs of dice in a little bag. I never even went to the school where I was from. My dad wanted me to play football so bad, he took me to Washington High School on the west side of Atlanta because they were number one. They never lost. I played for one year, but then I started gambling again and going to other hoods. All the people in school probably thought I was weird, so I was quiet the whole time I was in school. But I always paid attention to every single thing.</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>How was it interacting with the girls? Were you popular with them?</strong><br>Of course. Yeah. Girls like the cool guys. You would&#x2019;ve liked the cool guy instead of the class clown, right?</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>But weren&#x2019;t you cool, though, right? Cool guys usually have a lot of friends, et cetera.</strong><br>Oh, you mean, like, popular cool. I was popular cool because I played varsity quarterback in the ninth grade. But I was calm because I didn&#x2019;t really know anyone. Every girl at school had my number spray-painted on their faces and shit. I didn&#x2019;t know nobody, so I was just kept to myself. </p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Why&#x2019;d you decide to connect with Birdman and Cash Money Records?</strong><br>Because my whole life I looked up to them. I wanted to stunt like Birdman, which I fucking am. And I wanted to be like Wayne. </p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Plain and simple: Did you try to have Lil Wayne killed?</strong><br>Fuck no. </p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Does it bother you that Wayne, one of your idols, clearly has a personal problem with you?</strong><br>Maybe if I was a peasant it would. But of course it bothers me some, because that&#x2019;s what I always wanted. It was so weird: I always wanted to be in the studio with Wayne. I would tell Birdman to bring him over, but he never fucking came.</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>The first time I saw you perform was five years ago... </strong><br>That was when I <em>was</em> Wayne. And he&#x2019;s me now. </p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>What do you mean?</strong><br>I feel like if he had the chance to be himself or me, he&#x2019;d be me. If I had the chance to be myself or him, I&#x2019;d be him. That man is the greatest. If we had the biggest problem in the world, I&#x2019;d still say he&#x2019;s the best rapper in the fucking world. Everybody knows nobody raps better than the fucking boss. </p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.f">&#xA0;<strong>How do you feel about the whole Meek Mill/Drake beef? Tough month for Meek, right?</strong><br>Tough month for Drake, tough life for the other guy.</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Why do you wear women&#x2019;s clothing?</strong><br>Because women&#x2019;s clothes are [slimmer] than men&#x2019;s clothes. The jeans I got on right now, they&#x2019;re women&#x2019;s jeans. But they fit how they&#x2019;re supposed to fit. Like a rock star. The only thing I probably have in men&#x2019;s is, like, briefs. T-shirts. Ninety percent of my clothes are women&#x2019;s.</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>When did you start wearing predominantly women&#x2019;s clothing?</strong> <br>When I was 12 or some shit, started gambling, getting my own money. My dad wouldn&#x2019;t buy me tight pants. I had to get my own money to buy them.</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>It&#x2019;s one thing to wear &#x201C;rock star&#x201D; clothes when you&#x2019;re on stage with thousands of fans, it&#x2019;s another thing when you&#x2019;re 12 years old, shooting dice in someone else&#x2019;s hood. Did people fuck with you for it?</strong><br>Yeah, it was way more difficult. But I was so into that gangster shit. Dudes didn&#x2019;t play.</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>How do you get them not to fuck with you?</strong><br>How? Shoot the shit out of one of them. Beat the fuck out of them. However you have to handle it. There&#x2019;s no thinking [when someone disrespects you], we gotta handle it right then. So as young men, we had to do a couple things. Then people respected us. </p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>You tote guns very openly. Are you more rock star or gangster?</strong><br>Ninety-nine percent of me is rock star. Of course, I&#x2019;m a natural-born gangster. Who don&#x2019;t know that?</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>Are you ever worried...</strong><br>That something&#x2019;s gonna happen to me? Of course. I&#x2019;m still a human, so of course. I guess that&#x2019;s why I survive. I&#x2019;m with anything. If you want me to be a rock star onstage, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m ready to die about. But if you got a gun in my face, I ain&#x2019;t gonna wimp out. I wanna die being a rock star. </p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>What&#x2019;s your biggest fear?</strong><br>Not seeing God.</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>When you die? </strong><br>Yeah. I want to see Him, I really do. And I&#x2019;m afraid of my mom dying. If my mom died, I wouldn&#x2019;t want to do nothing. I would die. Quit.</p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>Where does she live now?</strong><br>She&#x2019;s 51, with an enlarged heart, so at any time it could just burst or stop. But she lives somewhere in Georgia. Not a peasant can get to her. </p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>Is that the driving force behind you making so many records nonstop?</strong><br>Yeah. I just be like, <em>I look at her smile</em>. She has eleven kids; I was the tenth. None of us ever had anything. So now that we finally got a little something...it&#x2019;s me. </p><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>Glad she kept making kids! </strong><br>So fucking glad she had me. I&#x2019;m pretty sure she&#x2019;s glad as fuck she had me, too.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.r"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".19onhp4gdfk.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>Read More:</strong>
