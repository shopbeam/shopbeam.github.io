  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AA few weeks before Texas Senator Ted Cruz officially decided to seek a new job—that of President of the United States—Catherine Frazier had to quit hers. For the past two years, she\u0027d been Cruz\u0027s Senate press secretary; now she was going to do the same job for his presidential campaign—which meant leaving the federal government payroll. Quitting one\u0027s job to join a presidential campaign is unsurprisingly common: According to Frazier, at least three other aides in Cruz\u0027s Senate office have decamped to his presidential campaign team. Even Cruz\u0027s wife, Heidi, has taken an unpaid leave from her job at Goldman Sachs for the duration of her husband\u0027s campaign.\u000A\u000ASeemingly the only person in Cruz World whose job hasn\u0027t been impacted by Cruz\u0027s decision to run for president? Ted Cruz. As he crisscrosses the country in pursuit of the presidency—this weekend was in South Carolina for a Republican cattle call—he continues to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate (and pull down his $174,000 annual salary). There on Capitol Hill, he\u0027s joined by three other officially-declared presidential candidates: Kentucky\u0027s Rand Paul, Florida\u0027s Marco Rubio, and Vermont\u0027s Bernie Sanders. Next month, a fifth U.S. Senator, South Carolina\u0027s Lindsey Graham, is expected to toss his hat in the ring. Meanwhile, it\u0027s only a matter of time until Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal officially launch their own presidential bids. And none of them will quit their taxpayer-funded day jobs in order to do so.\u000A\u000ABut the option to holding down other jobs while running for president isn\u0027t always available to candidates in the private sector. Right before retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson officially launched his presidential campaign last week, he resigned from the corporate boards of Costco and a biotech firm. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, meanwhile, gave up his Fox News show and even stopped serving as the spokesman for a questionable diabetes cure in order to run for the White House. Maybe that\u0027s why, in announcing his presidential candidacy earlier this week, Huckabee took a shot at his fellow presidential candidates who haven\u0027t made such sacrifices. \u0022If you live off the government payroll and you want to run for [an] office other than the one you\u0027ve been elected to,\u0022 he said, \u0022then at least have the integrity and decency to resign the one that you don\u0027t want anymore.\u0022\u000A\u000AHuckabee\u0027s got a point. Yes, there\u0027s a long and venerable tradition of this sort of political multitasking. When John F. Kennedy ran for president in 1960, he remained a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. In 1992, Bill Clinton continued to govern Arkansas while he pursued the White House — even abandoning the campaign trail at one point to fly back to Little Rock to oversee an ecution. But, while those campaigns were undoubtedly full-time endeavors, they were shorter ones: Kennedy\u0027s campaign didn\u0027t officially begin until about 11 months before election day; Clinton\u0027s kicked off in a little over a year before he won the White House.\u000A\u000AThese days presidential campaigns officially start nearly two years before election day—to say nothing of all the unofficial campaigning that occurs before an announcement—and that means an awful lot of missed work for those candidates who run while holding elected office. Barack Obama, who officially launched his 2008 presidential campaign in February of 2007, didn\u0027t participate in 53 percent of Senate votes in his last two years representing Illinois; his Republican opponent, Arizona Senator, John McCain, missed 64 percent of the votes in that same period.\u000A\u000AAnd the current crop of multi-taskers isn\u0027t faring much better. In the Senate, according to a tally last month by Roll Call\u0027s Hawkins, Rubio had skipped 21 percent of votes this year, while Cruz had missed 18 percent of them and Lindsey Graham had missed 12 percent. (Paul, by contrast, had only missed 1 percent of votes.) When Cruz recently took some flack from Republican activists for skipping the vote that confirmed Loretta Lynch as Attorney General--an appointment he stridently opposed and vowed to vote against--he offered the novel explanation that \u0022[a]bsence is the equivalent of a no vote.\u0022 And it\u0027s not just votes that Cruz has been missing. In March Politico reported that Cruz had attended only 3 of the Senate Armed Services Committee\u0027s 16 public hearings this year.\u000A\u000AAs for Governors, there\u0027s no tidy metric—like votes and committee hearings—to calculate all the work that goes undone while they run for the White House, but the anecdotal evidence is plentiful. Christie, for instance, participated in public events in New Jersey on fewer than 50 days in the second half of last year. Walker\u0027s credential-burnishing trip to Great Britain earlier this year not only took him away from Madison but cost Wisconsin taxpayers $138,200. And as Louisiana hurtled toward an unprecedented budget crisis earlier this year, Jindal was spending much of his time courting Iowans and South Carolinians with pronouncements on foreign policy.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s a sitting senator or governor who\u0027s caught the presidential bug to do? Well, there\u0027s one role model for them. Nineteen years ago next month, a tearful Bob Dole, who\u0027d just sewn up the GOP presidential nomination, announced that after 27 years representing Kansas in the U.S. Senate, he was resigning his seat. \u0022I will seek the presidency with nothing to fall back on but the judgment of the people, and nowhere to go but the White House or home,\u0022 Dole said. The Senate, of course, was Dole\u0027s life. Considering how much Cruz, Paul, and Rubio profess to hate Washington, giving up their seats would seemingly entail little sacrifice.\u000A\u000AJason Zengerle is GQ\u0027s political correspondent.",

For the past two years, she&#x2019;d been Cruz&#x2019;s Senate press secretary; now she was going to do the same job for his presidential campaign&#x2014;which meant leaving the federal government payroll. Quitting one&#x2019;s job to join a presidential campaign is unsurprisingly common: According to Frazier, at least three other aides in Cruz&#x2019;s Senate office have decamped to his presidential campaign team. Even Cruz&#x2019;s wife, Heidi, has <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-23/cruz-s-wife-heidi-said-to-take-unpaid-leave-from-goldman">taken an unpaid leave</a> from her job at Goldman Sachs for the duration of her husband&#x2019;s campaign.</p><p data-reactid=".229onpia5fk.1.1.0.0.4.2">Seemingly the only person in Cruz World whose job hasn&#x2019;t been impacted by Cruz&#x2019;s decision to run for president? Ted Cruz. As he crisscrosses the country in pursuit of the presidency&#x2014;this weekend was in South Carolina for a <a href="http://www.scfreedomsummit.com/">Republican cattle call</a>&#x2014;he continues to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate (and pull down his $174,000 annual salary). There on Capitol Hill, he&#x2019;s joined by three other officially-declared presidential candidates: Kentucky&#x2019;s Rand Paul, Florida&#x2019;s Marco Rubio, and Vermont&#x2019;s Bernie Sanders. Next month, a fifth U.S. Senator, South Carolina&#x2019;s Lindsey Graham, is <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/05/07/capital-download-lindsey-graham-2016/70948784/">expected to toss</a> his hat in the ring. Meanwhile, it&#x2019;s only a matter of time until Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal officially launch their own presidential bids. And none of them will quit their taxpayer-funded day jobs in order to do so.</p><p data-reactid=".229onpia5fk.1.1.0.0.4.3">But the option to holding down other jobs while running for president isn&#x2019;t always available to candidates in the private sector. Right before retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson officially launched his presidential campaign last week, he resigned from the corporate boards of <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/morning_call/2015/05/ben-carson-leaves-costco-board-after-declaring-run.html">Costco</a> and <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-ben-carson-vaccinogen-20150505-story.html">a biotech firm</a>. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, meanwhile, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/03/huckabee-leaves-fox-news-says-will-make-2016-decision-by-late-spring/">gave up his Fox News show</a> and even <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/us/politics/huckabee-pursues-unconventional-ways-to-fund-a-campaign.html?ref=politics&amp;_r=0">stopped serving as the spokesman</a> for a questionable diabetes cure in order to run for the White House. Maybe that&#x2019;s why, in announcing his presidential candidacy earlier this week, Huckabee <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/05/05/mike-huckabees-announcement-speech-attacks-ranked/">took a shot</a> at his fellow presidential candidates who haven&#x2019;t made such sacrifices. &quot;If you live off the government payroll and you want to run for [an] office other than the one you&#x2019;ve been elected to,&quot; he said, &quot;then at least have the integrity and decency to resign the one that you don&#x2019;t want anymore.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".229onpia5fk.1.1.0.0.4.5">Huckabee&#x2019;s got a point. Yes, there&#x2019;s a long and venerable tradition of this sort of political multitasking. When John F. Kennedy ran for president in 1960, he remained a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. In 1992, Bill Clinton continued to govern Arkansas while he pursued the White House &#x2014; even abandoning the campaign trail at one point to fly back to Little Rock to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/25/us/1992-campaign-death-penalty-arkansas-ecution-raises-questions-governor-s.html">oversee an ecution</a>. But, while those campaigns were undoubtedly full-time endeavors, they were shorter ones: Kennedy&#x2019;s campaign didn&#x2019;t officially begin until about 11 months before election day; Clinton&#x2019;s kicked off in a little over a year before he won the White House.</p><p data-reactid=".229onpia5fk.1.1.0.0.4.6">These days presidential campaigns officially start nearly two years before election day&#x2014;to say nothing of all the unofficial campaigning that occurs before an announcement&#x2014;and that means an awful lot of missed work for those candidates who run while holding elected office. Barack Obama, who officially launched his 2008 presidential campaign in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021000879.html">February of 2007</a>, didn&#x2019;t participate in <a href="http://blogs.rollcall.com/hawkings/cq-vote-studies-cq-vote-watch-rubio-paul-cruz/">53 percent</a> of Senate votes in his last two years representing Illinois; his Republican opponent, Arizona Senator, John McCain, missed 64 percent of the votes in that same period.</p><p data-reactid=".229onpia5fk.1.1.0.0.4.7">And the current crop of multi-taskers isn&#x2019;t faring much better. In the Senate, according to a <a href="http://blogs.rollcall.com/hawkings/cq-vote-studies-cq-vote-watch-rubio-paul-cruz/">tally</a> last month by <em>Roll Call</em>&#x2019;s Hawkins, Rubio had skipped 21 percent of votes this year, while Cruz had missed 18 percent of them and Lindsey Graham had missed 12 percent. (Paul, by contrast, had only missed 1 percent of votes.) When Cruz recently took some flack from Republican activists for skipping the vote that confirmed Loretta Lynch as Attorney General--an appointment he stridently opposed and vowed to vote against--he offered the novel explanation that &quot;[a]bsence is the equivalent of a no vote.&quot; And it&#x2019;s not just votes that Cruz has been missing. In March <em>Politico</em> <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/ted-cruz-2016-armed-services-committee-attendance-116522.html">reported</a> that Cruz had attended only 3 of the Senate Armed Services Committee&#x2019;s 16 public hearings this year.</p><p data-reactid=".229onpia5fk.1.1.0.0.4.8">As for Governors, there&#x2019;s no tidy metric&#x2014;like votes and committee hearings&#x2014;to calculate all the work that goes undone while they run for the White House, but the anecdotal evidence is plentiful. Christie, for instance, participated in public events in New Jersey on <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/christie-faces-criticism-on-out-of-state-travel-refocuses-on-new-jersey-1424482289">fewer than 50 days</a> in the second half of last year. Walker&#x2019;s credential-burnishing trip to Great Britain earlier this year not only took him away from Madison but <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/scott-walkers-trip-to-great-britain-cost-taxpayers-138000-b99478419z1-299230961.html">cost Wisconsin taxpayers $138,200</a>. And as Louisiana hurtled toward an unprecedented budget crisis earlier this year, Jindal was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/us/governors-tactics-at-center-of-louisiana-budget-vortex.html?_r=0">spending much of his time</a> courting Iowans and South Carolinians with pronouncements on foreign policy.</p><p data-reactid=".229onpia5fk.1.1.0.0.4.9">What&#x2019;s a sitting senator or governor who&#x2019;s caught the presidential bug to do? Well, there&#x2019;s one role model for them. Nineteen years ago next month, a tearful Bob Dole, who&#x2019;d just sewn up the GOP presidential nomination, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/news/9605/15/dole.quits/transcript.shtml">announced</a> that after 27 years representing Kansas in the U.S. Senate, he was resigning his seat. &quot;I will seek the presidency with nothing to fall back on but the judgment of the people, and nowhere to go but the White House or home,&quot; Dole said. The Senate, of course, was Dole&#x2019;s life. Considering how much Cruz, Paul, and Rubio <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/09/us/politics/ted-cruz-and-rand-paul-lead-republican-attacks-on-congress.html?_r=0&amp;nlid=25730526&amp;referrer=">profess to hate Washington</a>, giving up their seats would seemingly entail little sacrifice.</p><p data-reactid=".229onpia5fk.1.1.0.0.4.a"><em>Jason Zengerle is GQ&#x2019;s political correspondent.</em></p></div><div class="grid"
