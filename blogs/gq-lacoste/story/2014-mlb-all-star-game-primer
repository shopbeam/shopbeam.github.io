  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThis year\u0027s MLB All Star Game, played at Target Field in Minneapolis on Tuesday at 8:00PM on Fox, has the potential to be a pretty good one. With names like Kershaw, Cabrera, and Trout leading both lineups, we very well could be watching some of the best ever to play the game in a rare chance to go head-to-head. Whether it ends up being a lights-out rubber match, or long-ball epic, here\u0027s everything you need to know about the players taking the field for the 2014 MLB All-Star Game.\u000A\u000AIt Will be a Master Class in Pitching:\u000A\u000A \u0022Pitching wins championships,\u0022 or so the old adage goes. And while, like any All-Star game, there is plenty of offensive capability on both sides, it is the pitching this year that has the potential to go completely mental. For the National League, we\u0027ll get to see possibly the greatest one-two, left-right pitching duo in baseball: The Dodgers\u0027 Clayton Kershaw and Zack Grienke. Kershaw, 26, is having yet another season for the record books. So far he\u0027s pitched his first no-hitter, thrown 41 consecutive scoreless innings, 18 behind MLB record-holder Orel Hershiser, and is torturing opposing teams with a paltry 1.78 ERA. And, of course Grienke, who is 11-5 with a 2.73 ERA, is right there behind him. Other NL highlights will include Adam Wainwright (STL), lefty Aroldis Chapman (CIN), and Craig Kimbrel (ATL), who is currently steamrolling the NL East with a 1.91 ERA.\u000A\u000AAnd while the NL side of the pitching coin looks terrifyingly dominant, the fact is that the AL has a lot more balance between lefties and righties among their starting pitchers. The NL, by contrast, is heavy on right-handed pitching. And since guys like Scott Kazmir (OAK), Jon Lester (BOS), and Felix Hernandez (SEA) are pretty dominant in their own right, it might be that the AL has the edge on this one. Either way, expect to see both sides throwing a whole bunch of fire and smoke.\u000A\u000AThe Bats:\u000A\u000A Standing in the way of those lights-out arms will of course be a whole arsenal of big bats. Giancarlo Stanton (MIA), the current NL home run co-leader will be the DH, and Troy Tulowitzki (COL), tied atop the NL home run list with Stanton, will be the starting shortstop for the National League. (Tulo will also be captaining the NL side of the Home Run Derby tonight). In terms of the long ball, however, the AL looks to have the distinct advantage with Nelson Cruz (BAL), Jose Abreu (CHW), Victor Martinez (DET), and Mike Trout (LAA) all in attendance and all currently with 20-plus home runs for the season. And beyond simple power matchups, guys like Oakland\u0027s Josh Donaldson, Toronto\u0027s Jose Bautista, L.A.\u0027s Yasiel Puig, and Milwaukee\u0027s Aramis Ramirez will be incredibly tough outs for opposing pitching, no matter how far the ball is hit.\u000A\u000AThe Speed:\u000A\u000A There are some serious jackrabbits on both sides of this All-Star game. Guys like Yasiel Puig (LAD) and Carlos Gomez (MIL) certainly have plenty of speed. But in terms guys who flat out run like bolts of lightening, the Dodgers\u0027 Dee Gordon and Houston\u0027s Jose Altuve will be the ones to watch. Both are leading their respective leagues in stolen bases, and both look like someone sped up the film every time they leg it out on the base paths. But it won\u0027t just be their speed that will be exciting to watch, especially if they\u0027re brought in late in the game as pinch runners, it will be the fact that they\u0027ll be testing the arms of these guys...\u000A\u000ASee Outfield Canons in Action:\u000A\u000A If you\u0027ve caught even a sliver of Sportscenter highlights this season, you\u0027ve probably seen L.A.\u0027s Yasiel Puig throwing out some poor unsuspecting soul from a preposterously deep distance in right field. The man doesn\u0027t have an arm so much as a military-grade weapon. But Puig isn\u0027t the only player launching balls from the great beyond. Kansas City\u0027s Alex Gordon and Oakland\u0027s Yoenis Cespedes will be a potentially lethal pair of arms for NL base runners as well. And behind the plate, Kansas City\u0027s Salvador Perez could prove big trouble for any National Leaguer even thinking about stealing a base.\u000A\u000AThe Last Time...\u000A\u000A Expect to hear these words a lot with Yankees shortstop and future Hall of Famer Derek Jeter making his final All-Star appearance. His place in the starting AL lineup could be worth watching for both fans of the perennial All-Star, as well as those hoping for a little schadenfreude should his performance fall short, considering that, based purely on numbers, he probably shouldn\u0027t be there at all this year. With Jeter\u0027s offense looking mediocre so far this season at .272/.324/.322, and his defense looking even weaker, it\u0027s not hard to see his inclusion as a sentimental victory lap. But come on, why not. The dude will go down in history as one of the greatest and best-loved ballplayers ever to strap on a pair of spikes. Even Yankee-haters can\u0027t help but like the guy, and that\u0027s saying a lot. And besides, who doesn\u0027t want to hear Joe Buck lament, \u0022and there goes the last pack of sunflower seeds Jeter will ever spit out in an All-Star game.\u0022\u000A\u000AGet a Glimpse of the Future of MLB:\u000A\u000A In his fourth year as a Major Leaguer, the Angels\u0027 Mike Trout, 22, has undoubtedly silenced anyone who thought his initial burst onto the scene might have been a fluke. With 22 home runs, a .310 batting average, and a WAR of 5.5 so far this season, Trout is quickly living up to his early comparisons to Mickey Mantle. And in the National League, Clayton Kershaw is not only living up to his early comparisons to Dodger legend Sandy Koufax [LINK: http://grantland.com/the-triangle/clayton-kershaw-scorless-innings-streak-historic-2014-season/], he\u0027s obliterating them. With his curve, fastball, and slider firing on all cylinders right now, not to mention his OCD-level in-game focus, Kershaw has become borderline unhittable. Just ask anyone in the NL West. It\u0027s still too early to say, and a lot can happen in sports that has nothing to do with a player\u0027s individual skill or talent, but it\u0027s possible that right now we could be watching two of the best players in the history of the game.\u000A\u000AThere Will be Players Caring About Home Field Advantage:\u000A\u000A Given that every MLB team sends a representative to the All-Star Game, there will always be some guys playing in it who actually have a stake in the World Series home field-winning outcome. But this year, the top three division leaders in baseball, the A\u0027s, the Brewers, and the Dodgers, (Detroit has a better winning percentage than Milwaukee and L.A. but have played 5 and 6 fewer games respectively) have a combined 14 players suiting up for All-Star duty. While that doesn\u0027t guarantee a great game, it certainly suggests that a decent number of guys out on the field will be playing their asses off in hopes of securing that home field advantage for the Fall Classic, which is never a bad thing.",

MLB All Star Game, played at Target Field in Minneapolis on Tuesday at 8:00PM on Fox, has the potential to be a pretty good one. With names like Kershaw, Cabrera, and Trout leading both lineups, we very well could be watching some of the best ever to play the game in a rare chance to go head-to-head. Whether it ends up being a lights-out rubber match, or long-ball epic, here&apos;s everything you need to know about the players taking the field for the 2014 MLB All-Star Game.</p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>It Will be a Master Class in Pitching:</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.3"> &quot;Pitching wins championships,&quot; or so the old adage goes. And while, like any All-Star game, there is plenty of offensive capability on both sides, it is the pitching this year that has the potential to go completely mental. For the National League, we&apos;ll get to see possibly the greatest one-two, left-right pitching duo in baseball: The Dodgers&apos; Clayton Kershaw and Zack Grienke. Kershaw, 26, is having yet another season for the record books. So far he&apos;s pitched his first no-hitter, thrown 41 consecutive scoreless innings, 18 behind MLB record-holder Orel Hershiser, and is torturing opposing teams with a paltry 1.78 ERA. And, of course Grienke, who is 11-5 with a 2.73 ERA, is right there behind him. Other NL highlights will include Adam Wainwright (STL), lefty Aroldis Chapman (CIN), and Craig Kimbrel (ATL), who is currently steamrolling the NL East with a 1.91 ERA.</p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.5">And while the NL side of the pitching coin looks terrifyingly dominant, the fact is that the AL has a lot more balance between lefties and righties among their starting pitchers. The NL, by contrast, is heavy on right-handed pitching. And since guys like Scott Kazmir (OAK), Jon Lester (BOS), and Felix Hernandez (SEA) are pretty dominant in their own right, it might be that the AL has the edge on this one. Either way, expect to see both sides throwing a whole bunch of fire and smoke.</p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>The Bats:</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.7"> Standing in the way of those lights-out arms will of course be a whole arsenal of big bats. Giancarlo Stanton (MIA), the current NL home run co-leader will be the DH, and Troy Tulowitzki (COL), tied atop the NL home run list with Stanton, will be the starting shortstop for the National League. (Tulo will also be captaining the NL side of the Home Run Derby tonight). In terms of the long ball, however, the AL looks to have the distinct advantage with Nelson Cruz (BAL), Jose Abreu (CHW), Victor Martinez (DET), and Mike Trout (LAA) all in attendance and all currently with 20-plus home runs for the season. And beyond simple power matchups, guys like Oakland&apos;s Josh Donaldson, Toronto&apos;s Jose Bautista, L.A.&apos;s Yasiel Puig, and Milwaukee&apos;s Aramis Ramirez will be incredibly tough outs for opposing pitching, no matter how far the ball is hit.</p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>The Speed:</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.9"> There are some serious jackrabbits on both sides of this All-Star game. Guys like Yasiel Puig (LAD) and Carlos Gomez (MIL) certainly have plenty of speed. But in terms guys who flat out run like bolts of lightening, the Dodgers&apos; Dee Gordon and Houston&apos;s Jose Altuve will be the ones to watch. Both are leading their respective leagues in stolen bases, and both look like someone sped up the film every time they leg it out on the base paths. But it won&apos;t just be their speed that will be exciting to watch, especially if they&apos;re brought in late in the game as pinch runners, it will be the fact that they&apos;ll be testing the arms of these guys...</p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>See Outfield Canons in Action:</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.b"> If you&apos;ve caught even a sliver of Sportscenter highlights this season, you&apos;ve probably seen L.A.&apos;s Yasiel Puig throwing out some poor unsuspecting soul from a preposterously deep distance in right field. The man doesn&apos;t have an arm so much as a military-grade weapon. But Puig isn&apos;t the only player launching balls from the great beyond. Kansas City&apos;s Alex Gordon and Oakland&apos;s Yoenis Cespedes will be a potentially lethal pair of arms for NL base runners as well. And behind the plate, Kansas City&apos;s Salvador Perez could prove big trouble for any National Leaguer even thinking about stealing a base.</p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>The Last Time...</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Expect to hear these words a lot with Yankees shortstop and future Hall of Famer Derek Jeter making his final All-Star appearance. His place in the starting AL lineup could be worth watching for both fans of the perennial All-Star, as well as those hoping for a little schadenfreude should his performance fall short, considering that, based purely on numbers, he probably shouldn&apos;t be there at all this year. With Jeter&apos;s offense looking mediocre so far this season at .272/.324/.322, and his defense looking even weaker, it&apos;s not hard to see his inclusion as a sentimental victory lap. But come on, why not. The dude will go down in history as one of the greatest and best-loved ballplayers ever to strap on a pair of spikes. Even Yankee-haters can&apos;t help but like the guy, and that&apos;s saying a lot. And besides, who doesn&apos;t want to hear Joe Buck lament, &quot;and there goes the last pack of sunflower seeds Jeter will ever spit out in an All-Star game.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Get a Glimpse of the Future of MLB:</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.f"> In his fourth year as a Major Leaguer, the Angels&apos; Mike Trout, 22, has undoubtedly silenced anyone who thought his initial burst onto the scene might have been a fluke. With 22 home runs, a .310 batting average, and a WAR of 5.5 so far this season, Trout is quickly living up to his early comparisons to Mickey Mantle. And in the National League, Clayton Kershaw is not only living up to his early comparisons to Dodger legend Sandy Koufax [LINK: http://grantland.com/the-triangle/clayton-kershaw-scorless-innings-streak-historic-2014-season/], he&apos;s obliterating them. With his curve, fastball, and slider firing on all cylinders right now, not to mention his OCD-level in-game focus, Kershaw has become borderline unhittable. Just ask anyone in the NL West. It&apos;s still too early to say, and a lot can happen in sports that has nothing to do with a player&apos;s individual skill or talent, but it&apos;s possible that right now we could be watching two of the best players in the history of the game.</p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>There Will be Players Caring About Home Field Advantage:</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.4.h"> Given that every MLB team sends a representative to the All-Star Game, there will always be some guys playing in it who actually have a stake in the World Series home field-winning outcome. But this year, the top three division leaders in baseball, the A&apos;s, the Brewers, and the Dodgers, (Detroit has a better winning percentage than Milwaukee and L.A. but have played 5 and 6 fewer games respectively) have a combined 14 players suiting up for All-Star duty. While that doesn&apos;t guarantee a great game, it certainly suggests that a decent number of guys out on the field will be playing their asses off in hopes of securing that home field advantage for the Fall Classic, which is never a bad thing.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1xo0h8zjdvk.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
