  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AName: Tony Matelli\u000A\u000A Age: 43\u000A\u000A Hometown: Brooklyn\u000A\u000A Gallery: Marlborough Chelsea\u000A\u000A What He\u0027s Taking to Basel: \u0022Sculpture (Arrangement, at Marlborough Chelsea), Painting (Hand, at Green Gallery), among other things\u0022\u000A\u000A Tool(s) of Choice: \u0022Other people\u0022\u000A\u000A Influencers: \u0022Bob Dylan\u0022\u000A\u000A Instagram: @tonymatelli\u000A\u000AWhy do you create sculptures in this way? \u000A\u000AI started working in bronze 15 years ago, and I found that it was just a great material because it stayed put—it did what you wanted—it did what you told it to do. If it wasn\u0027t right you could cut it, you could weld it, you could shape it.\u000A\u000AI started doing this with the plants because the leaves needed to be so thin and the stems so delicate, and bronze seemed to be the only material that could achieve that. Originally I was doing it in plastic, which was really quite realistic. But those sculptures were floppy; they broke—they weren\u0027t permanent enough.\u000A\u000ASo, walk me through a piece like the lilies. \u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a very iconic image: a simple bouquet of flowers. The sculpture itself balances on one single bud, so the whole arrangement sits as though it\u0027s a flipped image. For me it\u0027s about a new type of gravity—a distorted reality. It\u0027s a very precise image in that the rendering is super tight, but then there\u0027s one simple thing, like the fact it\u0027s upside down, that throws it off.\u000A\u000ASome of these pieces remind me of Duchamp\u0027s readymades, which is weird because they\u0027re completely fabricated.\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t consider myself a pop artist in any way. That\u0027s not the dialogue I\u0027m really interested in, although the work uses some of that vocabulary. I\u0027m interested more in a romantic idea of the work where I\u0027m trying to find something maybe darker. I feel that I\u0027m trying to mine my own personal experience in the world rather than talk about culture outside of me. My interests are more internal than the pop artists.\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s more sensitivity. \u000A\u000AIn a way there has to be. There\u0027s an aspect of hyper-realism in this work, but I like to think there\u0027s a little more care in it.\u000A\u000AWhen your piece \u0027Sleepwalker\u0027 [a highly realistic outdoor sculpture of a man sleepwalking in his underwear] was installed at Wellesley it actually disturbed people.\u000A\u000AI think that this type of work, this type of representational work, has the potential to be really powerful because people connect with it so quickly—they have the ability to empathize with it. That\u0027s what I hope my work does.\u000A\u000APeople came at the sculpture at Wellsley from so many different angles. It proved to me was that this was obviously speaking powerfully somehow. It was sensitively made enough to illicit really strong reactions.\u000A\u000AWhat are your thoughts on the art market? \u000A\u000AIt\u0027s just something that happens. I\u0027ve been working too long to think about what it means; that\u0027s like chasing your tail.\u000A\u000AWhy should people be going out to look at art? \u000A\u000AOh my God! My family was just here last weekend, they\u0027re from the Midwest, and I took them to see three or four shows here in New York. And I kept telling them that every month this changes—this thing changes. It\u0027s hundreds of rooms for you to look at of free entertainment. It\u0027s so special and unique to have a person putting a lot of energy and a lot of money on the line just to make something for you to look at for free.\u000A\u000ASo whatever people say about the art market—prices going wild and things like this—it\u0027s still one of the things that everyone can still enjoy.\u000A\u000ATo me it\u0027s super interesting and a totally worthwhile to be involved in. It would be like a great band performing every week for free—new material, every week, for free. Can you imagine that? So it\u0027s that kind of access. That\u0027s what\u0027s so amazing about the gallery system, I think.\u000A\u000AWhen did you first come to New York? \u000A\u000AI moved here almost twenty years ago and started working immediately, right after graduate school. I moved to Williamsburg in the mid-nineties.\u000A\u000AWhat was that transition like? What was the community like then? \u000A\u000AWell, community\u0027s an important thing. I was in Milwaukee for a little while for school and then in Detroit. Those places have tiny art communities, and maybe one or two artists (and no more than that) performing on a national scale. But you come here and you can find any kind of community you want where people are really trying hard and performing at a top level.\u000A\u000AI couldn\u0027t imagine being in that small town again and not being able to see something that someone did just for the sake of doing something new or something interesting. To me that\u0027s just incredible. That\u0027s the incredible thing about New York; it\u0027s just jam packed with people trying to do that, wanting to do that, risking everything to do that.\u000A\u000AThat said, another thing about the art world that I think is really good is that there are many different art worlds. Basel Miami is one thing, but aside from that there are tons of other art worlds. My mom makes watercolors: that is a parallel art world. And so the democratic nature of the art world is something valuable, I feel.\u000A\u000ADo you have any advice for someone just coming to New York to become either an artist or an entrepreneur in general? \u000A\u000AYeah. My advice is to show up where you want to be. If you want to be somewhere, go there and just keep showing up over and over again. Eventually you\u0027ll be a part of that world. Done. And people don\u0027t know that! For some reason they forget it all the time. They\u0027re like, \u0027How do I get involved in this? How do I do that?\u0027 Well just show up! It\u0027s the art world. It\u0027s fucking free. You don\u0027t have to pay at the door. They give you beer. They give you free beer. They\u0027re inviting you to come. It\u0027s totally open.",

Matelli got in trouble earlier this year with students at Wellesley who opposed the installation of one of his hyper-real artworks, &quot;Sleepwalker.&quot; The disturbingly realistic sculpture of a nearly-naked old man wandering across the quad sparked controversy, apprehension, and even fear, though also a bit of laughter. That&#39;s the thing with Matelli’s painted bronze sculptures—they&#39;re troubling because they’re realistic—but in a skewed<em> </em>sort of way. It makes his art both disturbing and admirable</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.0"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c2d81177d66d68d5747b/master/w_768/style-2014-12-art-basel-tony-matelli-credit-jace-lumley.jpg" alt="style-2014-12-art-basel-tony-matelli-credit-jace-lumley.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F10-artists-to-know-at-art-basel-miami-2014-tony-matelli&amp;t=style-2014-12-art-basel-tony-matelli-credit-jace-lumley.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F10-artists-to-know-at-art-basel-miami-2014-tony-matelli&amp;t=style-2014-12-art-basel-tony-matelli-credit-jace-lumley.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F10-artists-to-know-at-art-basel-miami-2014-tony-matelli&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c2d81177d66d68d5747b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2014-12-art-basel-tony-matelli-credit-jace-lumley.jpg&amp;description=style-2014-12-art-basel-tony-matelli-credit-jace-lumley.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2F10-artists-to-know-at-art-basel-miami-2014-tony-matelli&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c2d81177d66d68d5747b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2014-12-art-basel-tony-matelli-credit-jace-lumley.jpg&amp;description=style-2014-12-art-basel-tony-matelli-credit-jace-lumley.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.1"><strong>Name: Tony Matelli</strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.2"> <strong>Age: 43</strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.3"> <strong>Hometown:</strong> Brooklyn</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>Gallery:</strong> Marlborough Chelsea</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.6"> <strong>What He&#x2019;s Taking to Basel:</strong> &quot;Sculpture (<em>Arrangement</em>, at Marlborough Chelsea), Painting (<em>Hand</em>, at Green Gallery), among other things&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>Tool(s) of Choice:</strong> &quot;Other people&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.8"> <strong>Influencers:</strong> &quot;Bob Dylan&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.9"> <strong>Instagram:</strong> <a href="http://instagram.com/tonymatelli"><strong>@tonymatelli</strong></a></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Why do you create sculptures in this way? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.b">I started working in bronze 15 years ago, and I found that it was just a great material because it stayed put&#x2014;it did what you wanted&#x2014;it did what you told it to do. If it wasn&#x2019;t right you could cut it, you could weld it, you could shape it.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.c">I started doing this with the plants because the leaves needed to be so thin and the stems so delicate, and bronze seemed to be the only material that could achieve that. Originally I was doing it in plastic, which was really quite realistic. But those sculptures were floppy; they broke&#x2014;they weren&#x2019;t permanent enough.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>So, walk me through a piece like the lilies. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.e">It&#x2019;s a very iconic image: a simple bouquet of flowers. The sculpture itself balances on one single bud, so the whole arrangement sits as though it&#x2019;s a flipped image. For me it&#x2019;s about a new type of gravity&#x2014;a distorted reality. It&#x2019;s a very precise image in that the rendering is super tight, but then there&#x2019;s one simple thing, like the fact it&#x2019;s upside down, that throws it off.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Some of these pieces remind me of Duchamp&#x2019;s readymades, which is weird because they&#x2019;re completely fabricated.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.g">I don&#x2019;t consider myself a pop artist in any way. That&#x2019;s not the dialogue I&#x2019;m really interested in, although the work uses some of that vocabulary. I&#x2019;m interested more in a romantic idea of the work where I&#x2019;m trying to find something maybe darker. I feel that I&#x2019;m trying to mine my own personal experience in the world rather than talk about culture outside of me. My interests are more internal than the pop artists.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>There&#x2019;s more sensitivity. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.i">In a way there has to be. There&#x2019;s an aspect of hyper-realism in this work, but I like to think there&#x2019;s a little more care in it.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>When your piece &#x2019;Sleepwalker&#x2019; [a highly realistic outdoor sculpture of a man sleepwalking in his underwear] was installed at Wellesley it actually disturbed people.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.k">I think that this type of work, this type of representational work, has the potential to be really powerful because people connect with it so quickly&#x2014;they have the ability to empathize with it. That&#x2019;s what I hope my work does.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.l">People came at the sculpture at Wellsley from so many different angles. It proved to me was that this was obviously speaking powerfully somehow. It was sensitively made enough to illicit really strong reactions.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>What are your thoughts on the art market? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.n">It&#x2019;s just something that happens. I&#x2019;ve been working too long to think about what it means; that&#x2019;s like chasing your tail.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>Why should people be going out to look at art? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.p">Oh my God! My family was just here last weekend, they&#x2019;re from the Midwest, and I took them to see three or four shows here in New York. And I kept telling them that every month this changes&#x2014;this <em>thing</em> changes. It&#x2019;s hundreds of rooms for you to look at of<em> free </em>entertainment. It&#x2019;s so special and unique to have a person putting<em> a lot</em> of energy and <em>a lot </em>of money on the line just to make something for you to look at for free.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.q">So whatever people say about the art market&#x2014;prices going wild and things like this&#x2014;it&#x2019;s still one of the things that everyone can still enjoy.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.r">To me it&#x2019;s super interesting and a totally worthwhile to be involved in. It would be like a great band performing every week for free&#x2014;new material, every week, for free. Can you imagine that? So it&#x2019;s that kind of access. That&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s so amazing about the gallery system, I think.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>When did you first come to New York? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.t">I moved here almost twenty years ago and started working immediately, right after graduate school. I moved to Williamsburg in the mid-nineties.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong>What was that transition like? What was the community like then? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.v">Well, community&#x2019;s an important thing. I was in Milwaukee for a little while for school and then in Detroit. Those places have tiny art communities, and maybe one or two artists (and no more than that) performing on a national scale. But you come here and you can find <em>any</em> kind of community you want where people are <em>really</em> trying hard and performing at a top level.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.w">I couldn&#x2019;t imagine being in that small town again and not being able to see something that someone did just for the sake of doing something new or something interesting. To me that&#x2019;s just incredible. That&#x2019;s the incredible thing about New York; it&#x2019;s just jam packed with people trying to do that, wanting to do that, risking everything to do that.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.x">That said, another thing about the art world that I think is really good is that there are many different art worlds. Basel Miami is one thing, but aside from that there are tons of other art worlds. My mom makes watercolors: that is a parallel art world. And so the democratic nature of the art world is something valuable, I feel.</p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.y"><strong>Do you have any advice for someone just coming to New York to become either an artist or an entrepreneur in general? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.4.z">Yeah. My advice is to show up where you want to be. If you want to be somewhere, go there and just keep showing up over and over again. Eventually you&#x2019;ll be a part of that world. Done. And people don&#x2019;t know that! For some reason they forget it all the time. They&#x2019;re like, &#x2019;How do I get involved in this? How do I do that?&#x2019; Well just show up! It&#x2019;s the art world. It&#x2019;s fucking free. You don&#x2019;t have to pay at the door. They <em>give </em>you beer. They give you <em>free </em>beer. They&#x2019;re inviting you to come. It&#x2019;s totally open.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".gz7rf5qf40.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
