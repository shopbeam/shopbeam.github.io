  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AIt seemed like a given that Peggy Olson would open Season 7 in a position of power. Isn\u0027t that how they left things last year? Isn\u0027t that what this entire series has been leading up to? But no, that would be too easy for Matt Weiner, who planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway. The series creator pulled Peggy from behind Don\u0027s desk, throwing her into a tangle of professional and personal anxieties. And then, finally, Weiner re-balanced the scales in Sunday night\u0027s love letter of an episode, \u0022The Strategy.\u0022 Peggy\u0027s reconciliation with Don was more than that; it was a reconciliation with her life and career, the fact that she did it her way. And that moment was just as eye-opening, and emotional, for actress Elisabeth Moss as it was for the audience. GQ spoke to Moss, who is currently shooting Mad Men\u0027s final three episodes, about Peggy\u0027s rocky seventh season, her slow dance with Don, and the mysterious upcoming scene that made Moss cry.\u000A\u000A Plus:  See Our Episode 6 Recap\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: Are you still shooting Mad Men right now? \u000A\u000A Elisabeth Moss: Yep, we\u0027re still shooting.\u000A\u000ASo the entire time you\u0027re filming the second half of this season, you\u0027re watching the first half.\u000A\u000A Actually, to be perfectly honest, I don\u0027t watch the show while we\u0027re filming. It\u0027s too weird for me. I can\u0027t watch the show and then go to work a few hours later, while I\u0027m still playing the character. And it sucks, because I don\u0027t get to enjoy the show in a way that a lot of people do. I want to watch it! I\u0027m a fan of it.\u000A\u000AI loved this episode.\u000A\u000A Thank you! I\u0027ve heard some really great feedback, some of the best that I\u0027ve gotten. To be honest, I was super excited about it, and from what I remember about it, I love this episode. But you just don\u0027t know what people are going to respond to.\u000A\u000ADid you at least watch the \u0022My Way\u0022 scene?\u000A\u000A No, is it cool?\u000A\u000AThey shot it so that it pulled back to a mirror image of Peggy and Don, like he\u0027s leading on one side and you\u0027re leading on the other. It\u0027s very cool.\u000A\u000A Oh, that\u0027s so cool! [Laughs] That sounds awesome. I may have to watch that. It\u0027s funny, I did this interview where I mentioned it, and then I saw online, [fans] were speculating about what it was that I was talking about. I mentioned that there was this one thing I was really excited about that was going to happen. I can\u0027t remember exactly what I said. But they were like, \u0022Is it her and Don? Is it her and Stan? What is it?\u0022 And that was it, it was that scene.\u000A\u000AI\u0027m not sure what show the Peggy-Don shippers are watching.\u000A\u000A [Sighs.] I know. It\u0027s very funny, people\u0027s speculation sometimes.\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t even speculate on Mad Men. I\u0027m convinced that Matt Weiner sits up at night thinking about what other people would do-\u000A\u000A -and does the opposite. Yep. That\u0027s exactly right.\u000A\u000AIf this was the scene you were talking about in that other interview, then you knew about it in advance, right?\u000A\u000A Yeah, Matt mentioned the idea to me really early on, which occasionally he will do when he\u0027s excited about something, or even just to pitch the idea and hear someone\u0027s feedback. He\u0027s a writer first and foremost, so he\u0027ll pitch it in a way, and see if it\u0027s as good as he thinks it is. And he told me this one, and my eyes welled up and I said, \u0022Matt, I\u0027ve never asked you to do anything before, but I\u0027m asking you to please do that scene. It\u0027s too perfect.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat stands out from that day of shooting?\u000A\u000A I remember it very well, and it was very important to me. That song—you couldn\u0027t pick a better song for Don and Peggy, really! And that is a testament to Matt\u0027s genius, because I never would have thought of that song in a million years. It\u0027s not necessarily something that you associate with 1969. But it actually came out right around the time of the episode. And they played the song for us every single take. Sometimes when you do this kind of thing, you do it in silence and they put the song in later. But they played it every single time. And it was very easy to do when that song was playing!\u000A\u000AI\u0027d imagine it was pretty emotional.\u000A\u000A It was definitely emotional. It\u0027s a very easy thing, in a way, for Jon and I to do, because we are very old friends and we are very close and comfortable with each other. But there\u0027s been a few times in my life when I\u0027ve actually really welled up in scenes in a way that is not just me acting, in a way that is, \u0022I am having trouble personally, as Lizzie, keeping it together.\u0022 [Laughs] This, and one scene we recently shot that I can\u0027t really talk about, and then a scene where I left and went to the new agency at the end of Season 5 and said goodbye to Don. And this scene.\u000A\u000ASo the scene you can\u0027t talk about is the one where Peggy has sex with Don, right?\u000A\u000A [Laughs] Yeah, and it makes me cry. It\u0027s weird. It\u0027s a very weird, complicated scene.\u000A\u000AWe\u0027re joking, Internet! So Peggy got a weird reaction for the first couple episodes. Lou was taking stuff away from her, she was lashing out at work and crying in her apartment. What do you make of her state of mind in Season 7?\u000A\u000A I think you said it: Whatever you think is going to happen on the show, it\u0027s probably going to be something else. On another show, with another writer, Peggy would already be running an agency and would be in this incredibly powerful position. But on our show, it\u0027s not that fucking easy. And I feel like we left the audience at the end of Season 6 with that image of her behind Don\u0027s desk, and I can\u0027t tell you how many people said to me, \u0022Soooo, Peggy\u0027s going to be moving to Don\u0027s position!\u0022 And it\u0027s not a mistake. Obviously, we led them in that direction to think that. But that\u0027s not Mad Men. It\u0027s not going to be that simple. And in reality, it wouldn\u0027t be that easy for her. She wouldn\u0027t go from being copy chief to stepping into Don\u0027s position, as a woman who just turned 30 in 1969. I feel like, in the beginning of this season, she was going through these much more realistic, complicated struggles. And you have to have somewhere to go. What would we do if Peggy just came back and it was like, \u0022Everything\u0027s great! She\u0027s the head of the agency and she\u0027s super powerful and happy!\u0022 Then what would you do for the next fourteen episodes? [Laughs]\u000A\u000AThis last episode seemed the key to figuring out what was going on with her.\u000A\u000A Totally. And how fucking beautiful and cool is that writing, that you spend five episodes with this character floundering and struggling, and then you figure it out, and he says exactly why she\u0027s struggling? It was good for me to hear, too, as an actress. You know, we don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen, usually; we just read the scripts as they come, and I felt her struggling. For me, I was like, \u0022Ohhh, right, that\u0027s what it is.\u0022 She has that feeling that we all have. I had a friend text me today, a good friend who\u0027s a writer, and he was like, \u0022I have to say, that\u0027s how we feel today in the modern age as people in our late twenties and early thirties. You have this feeling of, okay, I\u0027m here where I thought I was supposed to be, and I\u0027m still not happy. And I\u0027m doing everything that I feel like I should be doing in life, but I still feel restless.\u0022 And I think that\u0027s a very common feeling that a lot of people have dealt with, obviously, and I think it was really kind of genius to have Peggy voice that. \u0022Everything\u0027s great, I\u0027ve got more opportunities, I\u0027m making money; things should be good, right? Why am I still sad?\u0022\u000A\u000AI have to say, I really connected to it from a creative standpoint—the line about \u0022living in the not knowing.\u0022\u000A\u000A More and more, Peggy has become this great representation of a certain type of creative people. She\u0027s very much a writer. And I think that having writers be the ones who are writing for her works out very well, because they know exactly how it feels!\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve been making films throughout your time at Mad Men, so I\u0027ve been guessing that you\u0027ll turn to film for a while after you wrap. Is that correct, or is making another TV show a possibility for the near future?\u000A\u000A I feel like in this day and age, TV is where a lot of the best work and writing is, but also, there are a lot of incredible films being made. So I don\u0027t intend on drawing any lines. Mad Men is still going to be airing for a while. Literally, if I did another TV show, I\u0027d have them airing at the same time. Which would be weird for everyone! I feel like I\u0027ve bought myself a little bit of time, in the sense that the last seven episodes will air next year. So I don\u0027t necessarily want to dive into another show right away, but I think that it\u0027s all a matter of the material, and if you get something that you respond to, you can\u0027t really say no to it. But I do think that, fortunately and unfortunately, there\u0027s a bit of a bar that\u0027s been set, and I would definitely have to do something that I believed in as much as I did Mad Men or Top of the Lake. You never know if something is going to hit or succeed or be good, but you know what you believe in. So yeah, I want to do movies for a little bit, but I would never say no to another show.\u000A\u000AWell, I can\u0027t wait to see what you end up doing.\u000A\u000A Thank you. And I can\u0027t wait for people to see the finale. We\u0027ve got three more episodes of 7B here, and I just read one of the best Mad Men scripts I ever read. And to be doing that after nine years is pretty fucking lucky.",

given that Peggy Olson would open Season 7 in a position of power. Isn&#x2019;t that how they left things last year? Isn&#x2019;t that what this <em>entire series</em> has been leading up to? But no, that would be too easy for Matt Weiner, who planned each charted course, each careful step <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/franksinatra/myway.html">along the byway</a>. The series creator pulled Peggy from behind Don&#x2019;s desk, throwing her into a tangle of professional and personal anxieties. And then, finally, Weiner re-balanced the scales in Sunday night&#x2019;s love letter of an episode, &quot;The Strategy.&quot; Peggy&#x2019;s reconciliation with Don was more than that; it was a reconciliation with her life and career, the fact that she did it <em>her</em> way. And that moment was just as eye-opening, and emotional, for actress Elisabeth Moss as it was for the audience. <em>GQ </em>spoke to Moss, who is currently shooting <em>Mad Men</em>&#x2019;s final three episodes, about Peggy&#x2019;s rocky seventh season, her slow dance with Don, and the mysterious upcoming scene that made Moss cry.</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.2"> <em><strong>Plus: </strong> <a href="http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2014/05/mad-men-recap-season-7-episode-6.html">See Our Episode 6 Recap</a></em></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.3"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>GQ: Are you still shooting <em>Mad Men</em> right now? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.6"> <strong>Elisabeth Moss: </strong>Yep, we&#x2019;re still shooting.</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>So the entire time you&#x2019;re filming the second half of this season, you&#x2019;re watching the first half.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.8"> Actually, to be perfectly honest, I don&#x2019;t watch the show while we&#x2019;re filming. It&#x2019;s too weird for me. I can&#x2019;t watch the show and then go to work a few hours later, while I&#x2019;m still playing the character. And it sucks, because I don&#x2019;t get to enjoy the show in a way that a lot of people do. I want to watch it! I&#x2019;m a fan of it.</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>I loved this episode.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.a"> Thank you! I&#x2019;ve heard some really great feedback, some of the best that I&#x2019;ve gotten. To be honest, I was super excited about it, and from what I remember about it, I love this episode. But you just don&#x2019;t know what people are going to respond to.</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Did you at least watch the &quot;My Way&quot; scene?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.c"> No, is it cool?</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>They shot it so that it pulled back to a mirror image of Peggy and Don, like he&#x2019;s leading on one side and you&#x2019;re leading on the other. It&#x2019;s very cool.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.e"> Oh, that&#x2019;s so cool!<em> [Laughs] </em>That sounds awesome. I may have to watch that. It&#x2019;s funny, I did this interview where I mentioned it, and then I saw online, [fans] were speculating about what it was that I was talking about. I mentioned that there was this one thing I was really excited about that was going to happen. I can&#x2019;t remember exactly what I said. But they were like, &quot;Is it her and Don? Is it her and Stan? What is it?&quot; And that was it, it was that scene.</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>I&#x2019;m not sure what show the Peggy-Don shippers are watching.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.g"> <em>[Sighs.]</em> I know. It&#x2019;s very funny, people&#x2019;s speculation sometimes.</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>I don&#x2019;t even speculate on <em>Mad Men</em>. I&#x2019;m convinced that Matt Weiner sits up at night thinking about what other people would do-</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.i"> -and does the opposite. Yep. That&#x2019;s exactly right.</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>If this was the scene you were talking about in that other interview, then you knew about it in advance, right?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.k"> Yeah, Matt mentioned the idea to me really early on, which occasionally he will do when he&#x2019;s excited about something, or even just to pitch the idea and hear someone&#x2019;s feedback. He&#x2019;s a writer first and foremost, so he&#x2019;ll pitch it in a way, and see if it&#x2019;s as good as he thinks it is. And he told me this one, and my eyes welled up and I said, &quot;Matt, I&#x2019;ve never asked you to do anything before, but I&#x2019;m asking you to please do that scene. It&#x2019;s too perfect.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>What stands out from that day of shooting?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.m"> I remember it very well, and it was very important to me. That song&#x2014;you couldn&#x2019;t pick a better song for Don and Peggy, really! And that is a testament to Matt&#x2019;s genius, because I never would have thought of that song in a million years. It&#x2019;s not necessarily something that you associate with 1969. But it actually came out right around the time of the episode. And they played the song for us every single take. Sometimes when you do this kind of thing, you do it in silence and they put the song in later. But they played it every single time. And it was very easy to do when that song was playing!</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>I&#x2019;d imagine it was pretty emotional.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.o"> It was definitely emotional. It&#x2019;s a very easy thing, in a way, for Jon and I to do, because we are very old friends and we are very close and comfortable with each other. But there&#x2019;s been a few times in my life when I&#x2019;ve actually really welled up in scenes in a way that is not just me acting, in a way that is, &quot;I am having trouble personally, as Lizzie, keeping it together.&quot; <em>[Laughs]</em> This, and one scene we recently shot that I can&#x2019;t really talk about, and then a scene where I left and went to the new agency at the end of Season 5 and said goodbye to Don. And this scene.</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>So the scene you can&#x2019;t talk about is the one where Peggy has sex with Don, right?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.q"> <em>[Laughs] </em>Yeah, and it makes me cry. It&#x2019;s weird. It&#x2019;s a very weird, complicated scene.</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>We&#x2019;re joking, Internet! So Peggy got a weird reaction for the first couple episodes. Lou was taking stuff away from her, she was lashing out at work and crying in her apartment. What do you make of her state of mind in Season 7?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.s"> I think you said it: Whatever you think is going to happen on the show, it&#x2019;s probably going to be something else. On another show, with another writer, Peggy would already be running an agency and would be in this incredibly powerful position. But on our show, it&#x2019;s not that fucking easy. And I feel like we left the audience at the end of Season 6 with that image of her behind Don&#x2019;s desk, and I can&#x2019;t tell you how many people said to me, &quot;Soooo, Peggy&#x2019;s going to be moving to Don&#x2019;s position!&quot; And it&#x2019;s not a mistake. Obviously, we led them in that direction to think that. But that&#x2019;s not <em>Mad Men.</em> It&#x2019;s not going to be that simple. And in reality, it wouldn&#x2019;t be that easy for her. She wouldn&#x2019;t go from being copy chief to stepping into Don&#x2019;s position, as a woman who just turned 30 in 1969. I feel like, in the beginning of this season, she was going through these much more realistic, complicated struggles. And you have to have somewhere to go. What would we do if Peggy just came back and it was like, &quot;Everything&#x2019;s great! She&#x2019;s the head of the agency and she&#x2019;s super powerful and happy!&quot; Then what would you do for the next fourteen episodes? <em>[Laughs]</em></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>This last episode seemed the key to figuring out what was going on with her.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.u"> Totally. And how fucking beautiful and cool is that writing, that you spend five episodes with this character floundering and struggling, and then you figure it out, and he says exactly why she&#x2019;s struggling? It was good for me to hear, too, as an actress. You know, we don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going to happen, usually; we just read the scripts as they come, and I felt her struggling. For me, I was like, &quot;Ohhh, right, that&#x2019;s what it is.&quot; She has that feeling that we all have. I had a friend text me today, a good friend who&#x2019;s a writer, and he was like, &quot;I have to say, that&#x2019;s how we feel today in the modern age as people in our late twenties and early thirties. You have this feeling of, okay, I&#x2019;m here where I thought I was supposed to be, and I&#x2019;m still not happy. And I&#x2019;m doing everything that I feel like I should be doing in life, but I still feel restless.&quot; And I think that&#x2019;s a very common feeling that a lot of people have dealt with, obviously, and I think it was really kind of genius to have Peggy voice that. &quot;Everything&#x2019;s great, I&#x2019;ve got more opportunities, I&#x2019;m making money; things should be good, right? Why am I still sad?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>I have to say, I really connected to it from a creative standpoint&#x2014;the line about &quot;living in the not knowing.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.w"> More and more, Peggy has become this great representation of a certain type of creative people. She&#x2019;s very much a writer. And I think that having writers be the ones who are writing for her works out very well, because they know exactly how it feels!</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>You&#x2019;ve been making films throughout your time at <em>Mad Men, </em>so I&#x2019;ve been guessing that you&#x2019;ll turn to film for a while after you wrap. Is that correct, or is making another TV show a possibility for the near future?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.y"> I feel like in this day and age, TV is where a lot of the best work and writing is, but also, there are a lot of incredible films being made. So I don&#x2019;t intend on drawing any lines.<em> Mad Men</em> is still going to be airing for a while. Literally, if I did another TV show, I&#x2019;d have them airing at the same time. Which would be weird for everyone! I feel like I&#x2019;ve bought myself a little bit of time, in the sense that the last seven episodes will air next year. So I don&#x2019;t necessarily want to dive into another show right away, but I think that it&#x2019;s all a matter of the material, and if you get something that you respond to, you can&#x2019;t really say no to it. But I do think that, fortunately and unfortunately, there&#x2019;s a bit of a bar that&#x2019;s been set, and I would definitely have to do something that I believed in as much as I did <em>Mad Men</em> or<em> Top of the Lake</em>. You never know if something is going to hit or succeed or be good, but you know what you believe in. So yeah, I want to do movies for a little bit, but I would never say no to another show.</p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>Well, I can&#x2019;t wait to see what you end up doing.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.4.10"> Thank you. And I can&#x2019;t wait for people to see the finale. We&#x2019;ve got three more episodes of 7B here, and I just read one of the best <em>Mad Men</em> scripts I ever read. And to be doing that after nine years is pretty fucking lucky.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".4ie9tor28.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col
