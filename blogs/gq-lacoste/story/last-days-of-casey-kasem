  	    "articleBody": "When Casey Kasem\u0027s wife got angry, it didn\u0027t matter that the old man couldn\u0027t walk and could barely talk. When Jean Kasem felt possessive, it just didn\u0027t matter that her ailing husband—the legendary deejay whose warm, husky voice had once reached a reported 8 million listeners in seventeen countries—couldn\u0027t swallow and was at risk for aspiration. Jean was upset that Casey\u0027s two daughters from his first marriage had dared to visit their father without her permission. Her will would be done.\u000A\u000AIt was after midnight on May 7, 2014, when Jean arrived at the Santa Monica convalescent hospital where her 82-year-old husband was suffering from Lewy body dementia, a disease similar to Parkinson\u0027s. She told the nurse on duty that it was unacceptable that Kasem\u0027s eldest daughters had come by the day before to talk with him and hold his hand. Jean said the facility offered \u0022no privacy for Mr. Kasem,\u0022 according to the nurse\u0027s sworn declaration, and therefore she was removing him immediately. The nurse told Jean that such a move could kill him. Kasem\u0027s feeding tube, which was surgically implanted in his stomach, would require immediate medical intervention if it became dislodged, and Kasem\u0027s doctor had refused to issue discharge orders.\u000A\u000AJean didn\u0027t relent. At 2:30 A.M., the sometime actress—a zaftig blonde who once played Loretta, the wife of Nick Tortelli, on six episodes of Cheers—put her bedridden husband in a wheelchair and rolled him out into the night. It had been just five years since Kasem signed off on his final countdown, but to look at him, you\u0027d think it might have been much longer. Frail and bewildered, he was loaded into a white SUV that was driven by a private caregiver. Jean and Liberty, her 23-year-old daughter with Kasem, piled into a different SUV, this one black, and sped away. Just over a month later, Kasem would be dead—and about to embark on a posthumous journey that would take him halfway around the world.\u000A\u000A\u0022This broad is right out of a Raymond Chandler novel,\u0022 Logan Clarke told me, referring to Jean and sounding like a man who\u0027s read a few Chandler novels himself. Clarke, a private investigator whom Kasem\u0027s eldest daughter retained to track Jean down, is one of several characters in this story who come across like some fun-house distortion of an L.A. stereotype. \u0022The six-foot blonde wannabe actress \u0027kidnaps\u0027 the seriously ill star from the hospital,\u0022 he says, \u0022and hides him from the world, with a private eye in hot pursuit.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASit back, close your eyes, and try to come up with an American celebrity, living or dead, you\u0027d be less likely to associate with this kind of lurid tabloid grotesque than Casey Kasem. (Okay, maybe Mister Rogers.)\u000A\u000ALong before America\u0027s most beloved radio personality got sucked into the vortex of his family\u0027s fierce infighting—before Jean barred his three children from his first marriage and his only brother from visiting him; before the battle spilled into court, racking up more than $650,000 in lawyers\u0027 fees; before Kerri, Kasem\u0027s eldest daughter, took custody of her father, prompting Jean to stand in a driveway hurling raw hamburger meat while quoting what sounded like Scripture; before various Kasem relatives accused one another of infidelity, of posing for pornography, of greed and lying and unimaginable cruelty; and before Kasem died in a Seattle-area hospital and his final chapter played out like a real-life Weekend at Bernie\u0027s—thirty-nine years\u0027 worth of weekend mornings began something like this:\u000A\u000AHere we go with the top forty hits of the nation this week on American Top 40, the best-selling and most-played songs from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from Canada to Mexico. This is Casey Kasem in Hollywood....\u000A\u000AHis voice was unmistakable—richly nasal, with an unpolished quality that he dubbed \u0022garbage\u0022 for its familiar guy-next-door tone. That, Kasem always said, was key to his popularity: He sounded like a regular Joe just telling a few stories. Except that the Detroit-born son of a Lebanese grocer was so much more than that. From 1970 until his final show in 2009, Kasem\u0027s reports of which songs had leapt up a notch and which had slid down reflected a belief in meritocracy and a sort of Horatio Alger-style optimism that was peculiarly, iconically American. When he read a long-distance dedication, he imbued it with an intimacy upon which his listeners came to rely. It comes to us in the form of a letter: \u0022Dear Casey...\u0022 Kasem was a constant reassuring presence that bound generations together. He was schmaltzy, sure, but classy, too. A reliable standard-bearer. A stand-up guy.\u000A\u000A\u0022Of all the radio personalities in America, Casey was the most significant, period,\u0022 said Mike Curb, a record ecutive and former lieutenant governor of California who was Kasem\u0027s close friend for more than forty years. On his show, Curb said, Kasem \u0022affected the culture of music and the importance of Top 40 music more than any person who has ever lived.\u0022\u000A\u000AKasem got his start in the mid-\u002750s, voice-acting on Detroit-based radio shows such as The Lone Ranger before becoming a radio announcer in his hometown and later in Cleveland, Buffalo, Oakland, and Los Angeles. He and a few partners launched American Top 40 on seven stations in 1970; that number would eventually exceed 500. The four-hour weekly program was tightly scripted, with folksy admonitions, lessons in music history, and plenty of \u0022teaser and bio,\u0022 a cliff-hanger technique that Kasem had developed while spinning records in the California Bay Area. (How did the B-52\u0027s get their name? Find out after the break....) By the time ABC purchased American Top 40 in 1982, Kasem was reportedly paid more than $1 million a year for that hosting gig alone. He was getting rich in other ways, too: He was the voice behind NBC\u0027s network promos (another $1 million a year), and he did countless ads and cartoon voices (most famously as Shaggy on Scooby-Doo) that brought in millions more. In 1989, he secured a five-year deejay contract worth $15 million—reportedly about the same as CBS was paying nightly news anchor Dan Rather.\u000A\u000AThis is about the time you\u0027d expect to learn that Jean Kasem was a recently acquired trophy wife, a gold digger like, say, Anna Nicole Smith, who married a man sixty-three years older, then sought to collect a hefty chunk of his fortune when he died just thirteen months later. In fact, it\u0027s a lot more complicated than that. Jean and Casey Kasem were closer in age—now 60, she was twenty-two years his junior—and they\u0027d been married for thirty-three years at the time of his death.\u000A\u000AThey\u0027d begun dating not long after Kasem\u0027s first marriage ended in divorce. Casey was lonely then, longtime friends say; he hadn\u0027t wanted to separate from the mother of his three children. \u0022How many guys have we heard of who end up in a divorce that they don\u0027t want, and then, on the rebound, along comes somebody who appears to think you\u0027re the greatest thing on earth?\u0022 Mike Curb told me, recalling that Kasem and Jean met at Kasem\u0027s agent\u0027s office, where she was the receptionist. Jean disputes this, or so she told me when we met at her suggestion in a hallway at the Los Angeles courthouse. There she ominously called Curb \u0022one of the accomplices\u0022 but refused to elaborate. However Casey and Jean met, they were married in December 1980, in a ceremony at the Hotel Bel-Air officiated by the Reverend Jesse Jackson.\u000A\u000AIn 1989, Casey and Jean moved into a 2.4-acre gated compound in L.A.\u0027s ritzy Holmby Hills neighborhood. The estate has seven bedrooms, ten and a half bathrooms, a motor-court fountain built around an ornate piece of the Brooklyn Bridge, a hair salon, a par-3 golf course designed by Bobby Trent Jones, and a heart-shaped pool with two bathhouses. They paid $6.8 million for it, and last year it was briefly on the market for $42 million. Since Kasem died, his estate has been estimated at $80 million.\u000A\u000AHearing that, it\u0027s natural to assume that Kasem\u0027s elder kids are fighting with their stepmother and half sister over their father\u0027s fortune. Not so, says Kerri. \u0022We\u0027ve never asked for it once,\u0022 she insists. The two sides are squabbling over a relatively small life-insurance policy, but there\u0027s no real dispute over the bulk of Kasem\u0027s wealth, most of which will probably go to Jean.\u000A\u000ASo where does all the hostility come from? It\u0027s as if there\u0027s never been a moment of peace between the sides—as if acrimony were simply the Kasems\u0027 way of being. Who \u0022started it\u0022? Who knows. But the bottom line is that Jean Kasem and her stepkids disagree about, well, everything.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAt 42, Kerri Kasem is striking, with long dark shiny hair and the lithe build of someone who eats sparingly, if at all. For decades, Kerri—an L.A. radio personality who has also been an MTV Asia veejay, a UFC host, a Maxim model, a bungee-jumping instructor, and an actress—was a vegan like her father. (Then her hair started falling out. She\u0027s now a vegetarian.) Not eating meat was just one of many ways that she and her brother and sister—Mike, 41, and Julie, 39—connected to their father after their parents divorced, Kerri tells me when I meet her for breakfast in Los Angeles\u0027s San Fernando Valley. \u0022We loved our dad so much,\u0022 she says. Their stepmother? \u0022She\u0027s psychotic. And what she did to that man is unconscionable.\u0022\u000A\u000AAccording to Kerri, who was 8 years old when Kasem remarried, Jean couldn\u0027t stand her stepchildren from the start. Kerri, Mike, and Julie came to the house every weekend as kids but never felt welcome. \u0022She would do weird things,\u0022 Kerri says of Jean. \u0022My dad would leave the room, and when he came back in, she would say we did or said something, so he would get angry.\u0022 On one occasion, Jean blew up at Kerri and several of her friends: \u0022She goes, \u0027Do you know what I fear? Liars!\u0027 I remember her crazy-eyed.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe kids and their stepmother barely tolerated one another for decades, but Casey still managed to maintain his relationships with Kerri and her siblings. Kerri remembers her father often trying to explain Jean\u0027s behavior. \u0022I knew he loved her,\u0022 Kerri said. \u0022He\u0027d say, \u0022\u0027She\u0027s insecure. It\u0027s going to get better.\u0027 One time, probably fifteen years ago, he said it again—\u0027It\u0027s going to get better\u0027—and all of us, including him, started laughing. It was like: It\u0027s not going to get better. It\u0027s never going to get better.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe kids were well into adulthood by the time their father started showing Parkinson\u0027s-like symptoms in the mid-2000s. Still, Julie and Kerri visited with him almost every Sunday. (Mike, who now lives in Singapore, where he is a deejay, would join the family whenever he was in town.) But the visits were never at the Kasem mansion; Jean had made it clear the kids weren\u0027t welcome there. Instead she would arrange for Casey to be delivered to Julie\u0027s home, Kerri says. Then, in the summer of 2013, Jean put a stop even to those visits, in part because Jean said his deteriorating health prevented him from traveling. \u0022She blocked us entirely from seeing Dad,\u0022 Kerri says. \u0022Then she started spewing lies—that my dad had distanced himself from us, that we had borrowed money from him. Like: junk.\u0022\u000A\u000ABy early October of 2013, after two months without seeing him, the kids grew concerned that Casey was not receiving adequate care. They organized a protest in front of the Kasem mansion, where about twenty-five people stood quietly holding handwritten placards. jean, why won\u0027t you let me see my dad!? read Kerri\u0027s sign, while Mouner Kasem, Casey\u0027s 78-year-old younger brother, held one that said i miss my brother. Jean called the police, drawing several squad cars and a helicopter to the scene—and the next day, there were headlines on CNN, TMZ, and just about every news outlet in between.\u000A\u000AIn the ensuing months, Jean offered a deal: Her stepkids could see their dad once a month for an hour, but a security guard had to monitor their visits, and the kids would have to split the cost of that guard with Jean. They would not be allowed to have phones or any other electronics with them, presumably to prevent photographs or any communication with others.\u000A\u000A\u0022It was like a fucking jail,\u0022 Kerri says of Jean\u0027s proposal. \u0022I said, \u0027I\u0027m not signing any of this.\u0027\u0022 Kerri\u0027s siblings, however, weary of the constant battling and worried they might never see their father again, caved to Jean\u0027s terms. \u0022My younger sister and I had our reasons for throwing in the towel,\u0022 Mike tells me when I reach him in Singapore. \u0022We said, \u0027Okay, fine, at least we\u0027ll get to see Dad.\u0027 I just felt like, \u0027I don\u0027t have any more fight left.\u0027 And then immediately Jean reneged.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe elder Kasem kids did see their father briefly in December, when he was hospitalized, but soon Jean moved him again. By early May of 2014, they had no idea where he was; Jean wouldn\u0027t tell them. Worried that Casey\u0027s time was running out, Kerri\u0027s lawyer informed Jean\u0027s lawyer on May 6 that Kerri intended to file papers to seek temporary conservatorship over her dad\u0027s care.\u000A\u000AThat same day, in a meta twist that only highlighted what a tabloid dream this story had become, someone from TMZ called Julie Kasem with a tip: Their father was living at the Berkley East Convalescent Hospital in Santa Monica. Julie, Kerri, and an attorney immediately drove over. The attorney had to cite a federal statute to be granted entry to Kasem\u0027s room, but once they got inside, the lawyer wrote in a sworn statement later, what unfolded was a heartwarming scene: \u0022When Kerri greeted her dad he responded by trying to talk, and his face lit up with as big of a smile as he can make.... It is hard to put into words how much joy Mr. Kasem showed at seeing Kerri and Julie.\u0022\u000A\u000AJust a few hours later, Jean and Liberty showed up, unhooked Kasem\u0027s feeding tube, piled him into that white SUV, and whisked him away.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAll this is even more undignified, of course, when you consider the kind of man Casey Kasem was in his prime. By all accounts, if you were to list the top ten things Kasem stood for—and yep, that\u0027s exactly where I\u0027m about to go—you\u0027d emerge with a picture of a principled, spiritual man, albeit one with a temper. He spoke up for what he believed, whether supporting animal rights (No. 1)—he took a break from Scooby-Doo after its producers made a promo deal with Burger King—or (No. 2) trying to correct stereotypical depictions of Arabs in movies and TV. He lamented that they were seen as only \u0022belly dancers, bombers, and billionaires.\u0022\u000A\u000AYes, he would sometimes explode at work. In one profanity-laced outburst, famously caught on tape, he sounded off about how hard it was to come straight out of the Pointer Sisters\u0027 funky \u0022Dare Me\u0022 to deliver a dedication to a Cincinnati man who had just buried \u0022a little dog named Snuggles.\u0022 (\u0022They do this to me all the time,\u0022 he griped. \u0022I don\u0027t know what the hell they do it for, but goddammit... I want somebody to use his fuckin\u0027 brain to not come out of a goddamn record that is, uh, that\u0027s up-tempo, and I gotta talk about a fuckin\u0027 dog dying.\u0022)\u000A\u000ABut even his exasperation made him more likable. It suggested that (No. 3) Kasem had taste. Besides, while he could be cantankerous, he was (No. 4) serious about self-improvement. He\u0027d completed Werner Erhard\u0027s est training in 1979, and in his off-hours he preferred tapes of gurus like Tony Robbins over any kind of music. He regretted that he hadn\u0027t been more vocal in his opposition to the Vietnam War (No. 5) and later spent considerable resources on political activism, supporting the Reverend Jackson\u0027s two bids for president (No. 6) and championing the rights of Palestinians to claim a homeland (No. 7). For many years, he taped his show just one day a week, devoting the rest of his time to causes that included fighting for the rights of homeless people (No. 8) and opposing nuclear proliferation (No. 9). And then there were his feelings about the afterlife (No. 10): According to his Lebanese Druze heritage, Kasem believed in reincarnation.\u000A\u000ABut when his illness, diagnosed in 2007, began to erode his faculties, all that he\u0027d built up began to break down, and the mounting rancor within the Kasem family only made his decline sadder and more poignant. As his life moved haltingly toward its conclusion, it was hard not to think about how, for four decades, Kasem had ended every show with the phrase \u0022Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars.\u0022 Now he was living another, much bleaker kind of countdown.\u000A\u000AAfter Jean removed Casey from the Santa Monica convalescent hospital, Logan Clarke, the P.I., got a frantic call from Kerri and began the process of tracking Jean down. A few days later, one of Jean\u0027s attorneys reported that the ailing legend was out of the country. That wasn\u0027t true. Jean, it turned out, had driven him to what has to be the last city on earth you\u0027d think to take a dying man: Las Vegas, where the couple, their daughter, and two caregivers occupied three suites at the Vdara Hotel &amp; Spa, just off the Strip. (Later, in court papers, Jean would say that she\u0027d taken Casey on \u0022vacation\u0022 to \u0022escape the theatrical antics of Kerri Kasem for a few days and realize some peace and privacy.\u0022) Kasem was not examined by a physician for nearly a week.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s hard to imagine what Jean was thinking. Best case? She was somehow in denial about the sorry state of her husband\u0027s health and hoped a weekend getaway would bring him happiness. The worst case: She was on the run, determined to hide his deteriorating physical condition, now exacerbated by neglect. By the time she chartered a jet to Seattle on May 13, Kasem was malnourished; according to court documents, she had attempted to feed him by pouring Ensure, a nutritional supplement, into his feeding tube. Back in California, he\u0027d had no open wounds. Now he had a painful new bedsore on his coccyx, bigger than a saucer, and a urinary-tract infection.\u000A\u000AWhen the plane landed in Seattle, an ambulance was waiting on the tarmac. The driver took one look at Kasem and presumed they were headed for the hospital. Instead, Jean asked to be taken to a private residence, a three-bedroom ranch house. The ambulance driver alerted adult protective services; bedsores can be a sign of neglect. When Clarke noticed an alert on a law-enforcement database, the mystery of Kasem\u0027s whereabouts was solved, at least temporarily.\u000A\u000AOn May 12, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge had granted Kerri temporary conservatorship over her father\u0027s medical care, and a week and a half later, a Washington judge upheld that order. But when Kerri headed north from Los Angeles to finally see her dad. Jean, who had hired a group of leather-clad veterans on motorcycles to protect the house, refused to let her in. Eventually, Kerri was allowed to visit her father. At Jean\u0027s request, a judge also ordered that \u0022photos taken of Mr. Kasem during visits shall not be disseminated.\u0022 But a few hours later, Jean did something that many saw as a far more egregious violation of her husband\u0027s privacy: She held a press conference at which she played audio of her husband moaning. She claimed he was upset about the judge\u0027s ruling.\u000A\u000A\u0022He\u0027s crying,\u0022 Jean said, accusing the courts of trying to \u0022rip him away from his family.\u0022\u000A\u000AKerri saw it differently. \u0022My dad was moaning because he had a bedsore bigger than the size of my hand—almost to the bone,\u0022 she told me. \u0022He was moaning because he had a bladder infection and she had no painkillers.\u0022\u000A\u000AOn June 1, Kerri showed up at the Seattle house with an ambulance and a team of medical personnel to transport him to a nearby hospital. As Liberty shrieked, \u0022Where are you taking my father??\u0022 Jean came out into the yard, raised a camera to her face to chronicle the event, and called Kerri an \u0022intrusive psycho.\u0022 Then she threw a pound of ground chuck in Kerri\u0027s direction while muttering about \u0022King David.\u0022 One phrase she recited over and over—\u0022To the dogs! To the dogs!\u0022—led some of the many, many people following this saga to speculate that she meant to liken Kasem\u0027s kids to canine carnivores feeding on her dying husband. Or perhaps she was alluding to the Bible\u0027s Psalm 59, attributed by some to King David? (\u0022Deliver me from mine enemies.... Let them make a noise like a dog.... Let them wander up and down for meat.\u0022) Only Jean Kasem could tell you for sure, and maybe not even her.\u000A\u000ABy the time Kerri got her father to St. Anthony Hospital near Seattle, he was alert but in critical condition. For the next two weeks, as the extended family gathered around Kasem\u0027s bedside (minus Jean and Liberty, except for one short visit), Kerri and Casey\u0027s court-appointed attorney consulted with doctors about what medical interventions were in his best interest. Not surprisingly, there was more than one document that supposedly specified Kasem\u0027s wishes, and they conflicted. Jean argued then, and argues to this day, that Kasem would have wanted to be kept alive via artificial nutrition and hydration. But by then Kerri had won control of the decision-making, and Jean wasn\u0027t there.\u000A\u000ABy the second week of June, attempts to hydrate Kasem were causing his lungs to fill with fluid, virtually drowning him. Soon he was removed from artificial sustenance and was given morphine to make him comfortable. Finally, on June 15, surrounded by his three eldest children and his brother, he died.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022Jean cut his life short,\u0022 Mouner Kasem, Casey\u0027s younger brother, told me. \u0022We could still have him today if she didn\u0027t do what she did.\u0022 Casey\u0027s health was deteriorating, to be sure, Mouner said. \u0022But she killed him a lot quicker than he would have went.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn the six months since Kerri hired him, Logan Clarke has made it his mission to get law enforcement to investigate Jean on charges of elder abuse. Even after months of little apparent progress, he still has high hopes, he says, that a Los Angeles Police Department probe will lead to criminal charges. \u0022Jean Kasem killed Casey Kasem,\u0022 Clarke tells me. \u0022And she will be arrested. You mark my words.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat seems unlikely. Despite a December TMZ report that claimed the LAPD had submitted its investigation to the L.A. County D.A.\u0027s elder-abuse section, the D.A.\u0027s office told GQ that \u0022a case has not been presented to our office\u0022 and sent us back to the LAPD, which did not respond to requests for comment.\u000A\u000AStill, that hasn\u0027t stopped Clarke and Kasem\u0027s kids from trying. In the weeks after he passed, they sought to have an autopsy conducted on Kasem\u0027s body, hoping to prove that Jean\u0027s alleged neglect reached a criminal level. But before they could get permission, Jean sent a cavalcade of vehicles to the Tacoma funeral home where Kasem\u0027s corpse lay: His bizarre journey, it turned out, was far from over. As was her legal right as Kasem\u0027s spouse, Jean then removed his body and took it...well, no one knew where. For weeks, Kasem was missing. Again. Clarke started looking for him. Again.\u000A\u000AOn July 15, he got the break he needed when officials in Washington issued a death certificate that said Kasem had been sent to Montreal. A French-speaking associate of Clarke\u0027s telephoned the Urgel Bourgie funeral home to confirm that Kasem was there. \u0022He called the main office under an assumed identity and was able to determine that, quote-unquote, Casey Kasem is in the deep freeze,\u0022 Clarke told me.\u000A\u000AFor several weeks, Kasem\u0027s elder kids tried to determine whether they could somehow get permission to bring their father\u0027s body home. But before they did, a Norwegian journalist, Marcus Husby, broke the news that Kasem was on his way to yet another foreign city: Oslo. Jean had sent a letter to Norwegian authorities requesting permission to bury her husband there, claiming that Kasem \u0022always said that Norway symbolizes peace and looks like heaven.\u0022 (His eldest kids say they don\u0027t think he\u0027d ever been there.) Jean also said she had Norwegian roots and that she planned to move to Norway \u0022by the end of the year.\u0022\u000A\u000AClarke says Jean\u0027s motives are simple: She hopes to dispose of her husband\u0027s remains outside the U.S. in order to \u0022avoid detection of the physical damage she had done to him.\u0022 In mid-August, Kerri wrote a letter asking Norwegian officials to refuse to bury her father, saying that Kasem\u0027s true wish was to be buried at Forest Lawn cemetery in Los Angeles, his home of fifty-three years. The letter was signed by twenty Kasem family members and friends and accompanied by a petition signed by more than 30,000 people.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Ron Galella/ Wire Image/ Getty Images\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhen I first spot her, Jean Kasem does not look anything like I expected. Throughout her marriage to Kasem, when they were often photographed together on red carpets and at awards shows, her fashion sense was as eccentric as it was legendary—I Dream of Jeannie hairpieces and dreadlocked wigs, headdresses and top hats, fake flowers and sequined cleavage. By contrast, the woman who walks into a Los Angeles courtroom one Monday morning in September is a study in moneyed restraint: Her white-blonde hair is stick straight and set off by a turtleneck sweater, long skirt, boots, and Chanel spectacles—all of them black. The only flash of color is the bright red patent leather Louis Vuitton bag whose handles she clutches with one hand. With the other hand, she holds on to Liberty.\u000A\u000AIf Liberty had been born a boy, her father wanted to name her Justice, and justice is what she says she\u0027s come to court to get. A stud in her nose and chipped purple-red nail polish on her fingers, she has the puffy eyes of a girl who\u0027s been crying for days, and soon she\u0027s weeping again. Mascara streaks down her face as she accuses her half siblings of neglect, religious fanaticism, murder. \u0022They\u0027re all Scientologists, and they killed my dad for money,\u0022 she says as her mother grips her shoulders from behind. \u0022They had him for twenty-four hours, and they took away all food, water, and medication, and he lasted two weeks. Can you imagine?\u0022\u000A\u000AKasem has been dead for months now, but the accusations Liberty is flinging are largely the same ones made in a declaration her mother filed almost a year before. In that document, Jean described the elder Kasem children as a \u0022toxic\u0022 presence that had \u0022irreparably shattered the lives of their father, his wife and youngest daughter.\u0022 Later she would allege that Kerri owed her father money, that she had made a living by being involved in \u0022soft-core pornography\u0022 (apparently a reference to Kerri\u0027s appearance in Maxim), and that as a Scientologist, she believed in \u0022an alien warlord\u0022 and wanted to give Kasem\u0027s fortune to the church. (Kerri denies that latter bit but will not comment on her religious beliefs, saying she\u0027s \u0022interested in many faiths.\u0022)\u000A\u000AI want to ask Jean about this, and about 600 or so other things, which is why I\u0027ve showed up at the courthouse, at her suggestion, to finally sit down and talk. For months I\u0027ve been asking for her side of the story. I want to hear Jean\u0027s version of her battle with Kerri, which, at least from a legal standpoint, has been truly epic and insanely expensive: Over the past year and a half, according to court documents, Jean has gone through a remarkable thirteen different sets of attorneys. The court record reveals a pattern: She hires a firm, there\u0027s a blast of filings, and then a few months later the lawyers ask the judge to be removed. (Jean\u0027s current counsel did not respond to GQ\u0027s requests for comment.)\u000A\u000AI want to ask Jean about her alleged younger boyfriend, a Canadian named John Paul Gressy, who\u0027d been living in the Kasems\u0027 oceanfront Malibu condo and driving Casey\u0027s Mercedes SUV for more than a year before Kasem died, according to Logan Clarke. And above all, I want to ask how it could ever be considered a good idea to take a very ill man who can barely speak or eat and discharge him from a convalescent hospital in the middle of the night, after disconnecting a surgically implanted feeding tube.\u000A\u000AAt one point, Jean texted me to offer \u0022an exclusive\u0022; another time, she addressed me, oddly, as \u0022a colleague\u0022 and asked me to recommend a publicist. But she always stops short of an in-depth interview. Now she demurs again, citing emotional exhaustion. Later she will text me, \u0022I have some breaking news for you if you can hang on a little longer.\u0022 And then: \u0022I would love to participate but only if the article is truthful and accurate. If it is not a thorough article, then I must respectfully decline.\u0022 She says she might relent if I will send her a list of everyone I\u0027ve interviewed. At that point, it\u0027s my turn to respectfully decline.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ACasey Kasem may be dead, but his voice lives on. In September, Kerri went on Howard Stern\u0027s SiriusXM show, where they talked about her father, and Jean, and whom Kerri has had sex with (Corey Feldman) and whom she hasn\u0027t (Ryan Seacrest). And in the following weeks, Stern has taken several phone calls on the air from Kasem\u0027s corpse. Once the voice said he was calling from the Gaza Strip. Another time, he was in the tower of Big Ben, looking out over London. It was funny, sort of.\u000A\u000AAsk Kerri and she will tell you that the saga of her father\u0027s death isn\u0027t just a cautionary tale about the Kasem family, or about any other rich and famous people and their troubles. Lots of families, she says, find themselves in similar situations, and she has launched a foundation called Kasem Cares to support adult children whose ability to visit and communicate with an ailing family member has been terminated or obstructed by a stepparent or other legal caretaker.\u000A\u000AMeanwhile, everyone has been in court (of course) arguing over how much of the case\u0027s gargantuan legal fees should be paid by Kasem\u0027s estate. And in a separate action, the company that carried Kasem\u0027s $4 million life-insurance policy, MetLife, has asked a judge to decide whom it should pay benefits to, since Jean, Liberty, and Casey\u0027s elder kids are all listed as beneficiaries. Predictably, each side is challenging the other side\u0027s right to collect.\u000A\u000AAnd what of Kasem\u0027s corpse? Throughout the fall, it remained on ice, inspiring headlines like this one from TMZ: Casey Kasem Rotting in Norway. In October, the acting head of Oslo\u0027s burial agency told a local TV station that he was still awaiting \u0022a clear signal\u0022 as to what to do. \u0022I\u0027ve never been involved in a similar case before,\u0022 the official said, \u0022and I\u0027ve been working in this capacity for thirty years.\u0022 There was no rush, he added: \u0022A body can lie a long time in the freezer.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe Kasem kids grew tired of waiting. In November, they filed court papers asking a judge to force Jean to bring their father\u0027s remains back to U.S. soil. They were denied. Finally, just before Christmas, came word that Casey Kasem had been put to rest at the Vestre Cemetery in Oslo. His kids found out just like everyone else did: from a Norwegian news report complete with a photo of a snow-dusted grave, adorned by three wreaths. There was no headstone. Kerri immediately took to social media, saying Jean had \u0022conned\u0022 the cemetery, and calling her \u0022abusive\u0022 and \u0022unfaithful.\u0022 \u0022How many more witnesses do you need...,\u0022 she wrote in all caps. \u0022West Los Angeles Police Department where are you?!\u0022\u000A\u000AThe eldest Kasem children console themselves with the idea that according to their father\u0027s Druze beliefs, he will soon be born again. As ghastly as it was to imagine his decomposing corpse, Kerri told me, \u0022he\u0027s not there anymore. Jean still thinks she owns his body. But he\u0027s with us. I feel him all the time. She can\u0027t hurt us or him ever again. Are you kidding? Lady, Dad\u0027s with us now.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a comforting thought: the loved one finally laid to rest, not here nor there but everywhere; the countdown that never really stops. As Kasem said in his last broadcast, on July 4, 2009: Over the years, musical trends have come and gone from disco to new wave, from punk to hip-hop, from bubblegum to rock. We\u0027ve been there, counting them down. It\u0027s been a great thirty-nine years, and it\u0027s really been an honor for me. But we\u0027re not finished yet.\u000A\u000AAMY WALLACE is a GQ correspondent.",

beloved deejay, the unmistakable voice who created &#39;American top 40&#39; and rose to fame on the schmaltzy but irresistible charm of his &quot;long-distance dedications.&quot; all of which makes the tabloid circumstances of his demise—an epic family feud waged in streets, courtrooms, and funeral homes from L.A. to Oslo—even more surreal. Amy Wallace investigates the tragic final days (and very weird afterlife) of a radio legend</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.0">When Casey Kasem&#x2019;s wife got angry, it didn&#x2019;t matter that the old man couldn&#x2019;t walk and could barely talk. When Jean Kasem felt possessive, it just didn&#x2019;t matter that her ailing husband&#x2014;the legendary deejay whose warm, husky voice had once reached a reported 8 million listeners in seventeen countries&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t swallow and was at risk for aspiration. Jean was upset that Casey&#x2019;s two daughters from his first marriage had dared to visit their father without her permission. Her will would be done.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1">It was after midnight on May 7, 2014, when Jean arrived at the Santa Monica convalescent hospital where her 82-year-old husband was suffering from Lewy body dementia, a disease similar to Parkinson&#x2019;s. She told the nurse on duty that it was unacceptable that Kasem&#x2019;s eldest daughters had come by the day before to talk with him and hold his hand. Jean said the facility offered &quot;no privacy for Mr. Kasem,&quot; according to the nurse&#x2019;s sworn declaration, and therefore she was removing him immediately. The nurse told Jean that such a move could kill him. Kasem&#x2019;s feeding tube, which was surgically implanted in his stomach, would require immediate medical intervention if it became dislodged, and Kasem&#x2019;s doctor had refused to issue discharge orders.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.2">Jean didn&#x2019;t relent. At 2:30 A.M., the sometime actress&#x2014;a zaftig blonde who once played Loretta, the wife of Nick Tortelli, on six episodes of Cheers&#x2014;put her bedridden husband in a wheelchair and rolled him out into the night. It had been just five years since Kasem signed off on his final countdown, but to look at him, you&#x2019;d think it might have been much longer. Frail and bewildered, he was loaded into a white SUV that was driven by a private caregiver. Jean and Liberty, her 23-year-old daughter with Kasem, piled into a different SUV, this one black, and sped away. Just over a month later, Kasem would be dead&#x2014;and about to embark on a posthumous journey that would take him halfway around the world.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.3">&quot;This broad is right out of a Raymond Chandler novel,&quot; Logan Clarke told me, referring to Jean and sounding like a man who&#x2019;s read a few Chandler novels himself. Clarke, a private investigator whom Kasem&#x2019;s eldest daughter retained to track Jean down, is one of several characters in this story who come across like some fun-house distortion of an L.A. stereotype. &quot;The six-foot blonde wannabe actress &#x2019;kidnaps&#x2019; the seriously ill star from the hospital,&quot; he says, &quot;and hides him from the world, with a private eye in hot pursuit.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.5"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.6">Sit back, close your eyes, and try to come up with an American celebrity, living or dead, you&#x2019;d be <em>less</em> likely to associate with this kind of lurid tabloid grotesque than Casey Kasem. (Okay, maybe Mister Rogers.)</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.7">Long before America&#x2019;s most beloved radio personality got sucked into the vortex of his family&#x2019;s fierce infighting&#x2014;before Jean barred his three children from his first marriage and his only brother from visiting him; before the battle spilled into court, racking up more than $650,000 in lawyers&#x2019; fees; before Kerri, Kasem&#x2019;s eldest daughter, took custody of her father, prompting Jean to stand in a driveway hurling raw hamburger meat while quoting what sounded like Scripture; before various Kasem relatives accused one another of infidelity, of posing for pornography, of greed and lying and unimaginable cruelty; and before Kasem died in a Seattle-area hospital and his final chapter played out like a real-life <em>Weekend at Bernie&#x2019;s</em>&#x2014;thirty-nine years&#x2019; worth of weekend mornings began something like this:</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.8"><em>Here we go with the top forty hits of the nation this week on</em> American Top 40, <em>the best-selling and most-played songs from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from Canada to Mexico. This is Casey Kasem in Hollywood....</em></p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.9">His voice was unmistakable&#x2014;richly nasal, with an unpolished quality that he dubbed &quot;garbage&quot; for its familiar guy-next-door tone. That, Kasem always said, was key to his popularity: He sounded like a regular Joe just telling a few stories. Except that the Detroit-born son of a Lebanese grocer was so much more than that. From 1970 until his final show in 2009, Kasem&#x2019;s reports of which songs had leapt up a notch and which had slid down reflected a belief in meritocracy and a sort of Horatio Alger-style optimism that was peculiarly, iconically American. When he read a long-distance dedication, he imbued it with an intimacy upon which his listeners came to rely. <em>It comes to us in the form of a letter: &quot;Dear Casey...&quot;</em> Kasem was a constant reassuring presence that bound generations together. He was schmaltzy, sure, but classy, too. A reliable standard-bearer. A stand-up guy.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.a">&quot;Of all the radio personalities in America, Casey was the most significant, period,&quot; said Mike Curb, a record ecutive and former lieutenant governor of California who was Kasem&#x2019;s close friend for more than forty years. On his show, Curb said, Kasem &quot;affected the culture of music and the importance of Top 40 music more than any person who has ever lived.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.b">Kasem got his start in the mid-&#x2019;50s, voice-acting on Detroit-based radio shows such as <em>The Lone Ranger</em> before becoming a radio announcer in his hometown and later in Cleveland, Buffalo, Oakland, and Los Angeles. He and a few partners launched <em>American Top 40</em> on seven stations in 1970; that number would eventually exceed 500. The four-hour weekly program was tightly scripted, with folksy admonitions, lessons in music history, and plenty of &quot;teaser and bio,&quot; a cliff-hanger technique that Kasem had developed while spinning records in the California Bay Area. <em>(How did the B-52&#x2019;s get their name? Find out after the break....)</em> By the time ABC purchased <em>American Top 40</em> in 1982, Kasem was reportedly paid more than $1 million a year for that hosting gig alone. He was getting rich in other ways, too: He was the voice behind NBC&#x2019;s network promos (another $1 million a year), and he did countless ads and cartoon voices (most famously as Shaggy on <em>Scooby-Doo</em>) that brought in millions more. In 1989, he secured a five-year deejay contract worth $15 million&#x2014;reportedly about the same as CBS was paying nightly news anchor Dan Rather.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.c">This is about the time you&#x2019;d expect to learn that Jean Kasem was a recently acquired trophy wife, a gold digger like, say, Anna Nicole Smith, who married a man sixty-three years older, then sought to collect a hefty chunk of his fortune when he died just thirteen months later. In fact, it&#x2019;s a lot more complicated than that. Jean and Casey Kasem were closer in age&#x2014;now 60, she was twenty-two years his junior&#x2014;and they&#x2019;d been married for thirty-three years at the time of his death.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.d">They&#x2019;d begun dating not long after Kasem&#x2019;s first marriage ended in divorce. Casey was lonely then, longtime friends say; he hadn&#x2019;t wanted to separate from the mother of his three children. &quot;How many guys have we heard of who end up in a divorce that they don&#x2019;t want, and then, on the rebound, along comes somebody who appears to think you&#x2019;re the greatest thing on earth?&quot; Mike Curb told me, recalling that Kasem and Jean met at Kasem&#x2019;s agent&#x2019;s office, where she was the receptionist. Jean disputes this, or so she told me when we met at her suggestion in a hallway at the Los Angeles courthouse. There she ominously called Curb &quot;one of the accomplices&quot; but refused to elaborate. However Casey and Jean met, they were married in December 1980, in a ceremony at the Hotel Bel-Air officiated by the Reverend Jesse Jackson.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.e">In 1989, Casey and Jean moved into a 2.4-acre gated compound in L.A.&#x2019;s ritzy Holmby Hills neighborhood. The estate has seven bedrooms, ten and a half bathrooms, a motor-court fountain built around an ornate piece of the Brooklyn Bridge, a hair salon, a par-3 golf course designed by Bobby Trent Jones, and a heart-shaped pool with two bathhouses. They paid $6.8 million for it, and last year it was briefly on the market for $42 million. Since Kasem died, his estate has been estimated at $80 million.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.f">Hearing that, it&#x2019;s natural to assume that Kasem&#x2019;s elder kids are fighting with their stepmother and half sister over their father&#x2019;s fortune. Not so, says Kerri. &quot;We&#x2019;ve never asked for it once,&quot; she insists. The two sides are squabbling over a relatively small life-insurance policy, but there&#x2019;s no real dispute over the bulk of Kasem&#x2019;s wealth, most of which will probably go to Jean.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.g">So where <em>does</em> all the hostility come from? It&#x2019;s as if there&#x2019;s never been a moment of peace between the sides&#x2014;as if acrimony were simply the Kasems&#x2019; way of being. Who &quot;started it&quot;? Who knows. But the bottom line is that Jean Kasem and her stepkids disagree about, well, everything.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.h"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c946e52bc4b477a9d836/master/w_806/life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-02.jpg" alt="life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flast-days-of-casey-kasem&amp;t=life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flast-days-of-casey-kasem&amp;t=life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flast-days-of-casey-kasem&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c946e52bc4b477a9d836%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flast-days-of-casey-kasem&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c946e52bc4b477a9d836%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.i"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.j">At 42, Kerri Kasem is striking, with long dark shiny hair and the lithe build of someone who eats sparingly, if at all. For decades, Kerri&#x2014;an L.A. radio personality who has also been an MTV Asia veejay, a UFC host, a <em>Maxim</em> model, a bungee-jumping instructor, and an actress&#x2014;was a vegan like her father. (Then her hair started falling out. She&#x2019;s now a vegetarian.) Not eating meat was just one of many ways that she and her brother and sister&#x2014;Mike, 41, and Julie, 39&#x2014;connected to their father after their parents divorced, Kerri tells me when I meet her for breakfast in Los Angeles&#x2019;s San Fernando Valley. &quot;We loved our dad so much,&quot; she says. Their stepmother? &quot;She&#x2019;s psychotic. And what she did to that man is unconscionable.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.k">According to Kerri, who was 8 years old when Kasem remarried, Jean couldn&#x2019;t stand her stepchildren from the start. Kerri, Mike, and Julie came to the house every weekend as kids but never felt welcome. &quot;She would do weird things,&quot; Kerri says of Jean. &quot;My dad would leave the room, and when he came back in, she would say we did or said something, so he would get angry.&quot; On one occasion, Jean blew up at Kerri and several of her friends: &quot;She goes, &#x2019;Do you know what I fear? Liars!&#x2019; I remember her crazy-eyed.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.l">The kids and their stepmother barely tolerated one another for decades, but Casey still managed to maintain his relationships with Kerri and her siblings. Kerri remembers her father often trying to explain Jean&#x2019;s behavior. &quot;I knew he loved her,&quot; Kerri said. &quot;He&#x2019;d say, &quot;&#x2019;She&#x2019;s insecure. It&#x2019;s going to get better.&#x2019; One time, probably fifteen years ago, he said it again&#x2014;&#x2019;It&#x2019;s going to get better&#x2019;&#x2014;and all of us, including him, started laughing. It was like: It&#x2019;s <em>not</em> going to get better. It&#x2019;s <em>never</em> going to get better.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.m">The kids were well into adulthood by the time their father started showing Parkinson&#x2019;s-like symptoms in the mid-2000s. Still, Julie and Kerri visited with him almost every Sunday. (Mike, who now lives in Singapore, where he is a deejay, would join the family whenever he was in town.) But the visits were never at the Kasem mansion; Jean had made it clear the kids weren&#x2019;t welcome there. Instead she would arrange for Casey to be delivered to Julie&#x2019;s home, Kerri says. Then, in the summer of 2013, Jean put a stop even to those visits, in part because Jean said his deteriorating health prevented him from traveling. &quot;She blocked us entirely from seeing Dad,&quot; Kerri says. &quot;Then she started spewing lies&#x2014;that my dad had distanced himself from us, that we had borrowed money from him. Like: junk.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.n">By early October of 2013, after two months without seeing him, the kids grew concerned that Casey was not receiving adequate care. They organized a protest in front of the Kasem mansion, where about twenty-five people stood quietly holding handwritten placards. jean, why won&#x2019;t you let me see my dad!? read Kerri&#x2019;s sign, while Mouner Kasem, Casey&#x2019;s 78-year-old younger brother, held one that said i miss my brother. Jean called the police, drawing several squad cars and a helicopter to the scene&#x2014;and the next day, there were headlines on CNN, TMZ, and just about every news outlet in between.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.o">In the ensuing months, Jean offered a deal: Her stepkids could see their dad once a month for an hour, but a security guard had to monitor their visits, and the kids would have to split the cost of that guard with Jean. They would not be allowed to have phones or any other electronics with them, presumably to prevent photographs or any communication with others.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.p">&quot;It was like a fucking jail,&quot; Kerri says of Jean&#x2019;s proposal. &quot;I said, &#x2019;I&#x2019;m not signing any of this.&#x2019;&quot; Kerri&#x2019;s siblings, however, weary of the constant battling and worried they might never see their father again, caved to Jean&#x2019;s terms. &quot;My younger sister and I had our reasons for throwing in the towel,&quot; Mike tells me when I reach him in Singapore. &quot;We said, &#x2019;Okay, fine, at least we&#x2019;ll get to see Dad.&#x2019; I just felt like, &#x2019;I don&#x2019;t have any more fight left.&#x2019; And then immediately Jean reneged.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.q">The elder Kasem kids did see their father briefly in December, when he was hospitalized, but soon Jean moved him again. By early May of 2014, they had no idea where he was; Jean wouldn&#x2019;t tell them. Worried that Casey&#x2019;s time was running out, Kerri&#x2019;s lawyer informed Jean&#x2019;s lawyer on May 6 that Kerri intended to file papers to seek temporary conservatorship over her dad&#x2019;s care.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.r">That same day, in a meta twist that only highlighted what a tabloid dream this story had become, someone from TMZ called Julie Kasem with a tip: Their father was living at the Berkley East Convalescent Hospital in Santa Monica. Julie, Kerri, and an attorney immediately drove over. The attorney had to cite a federal statute to be granted entry to Kasem&#x2019;s room, but once they got inside, the lawyer wrote in a sworn statement later, what unfolded was a heartwarming scene: &quot;When Kerri greeted her dad he responded by trying to talk, and his face lit up with as big of a smile as he can make.... It is hard to put into words how much joy Mr. Kasem showed at seeing Kerri and Julie.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.s">Just a few hours later, Jean and Liberty showed up, unhooked Kasem&#x2019;s feeding tube, piled him into that white SUV, and whisked him away.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.t"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.u">All this is even more undignified, of course, when you consider the kind of man Casey Kasem was in his prime. By all accounts, if you were to list the top ten things Kasem stood for&#x2014;and yep, that&#x2019;s exactly where I&#x2019;m about to go&#x2014;you&#x2019;d emerge with a picture of a principled, spiritual man, albeit one with a temper. He spoke up for what he believed, whether supporting animal rights (No. 1)&#x2014;he took a break from <em>Scooby-Doo</em> after its producers made a promo deal with Burger King&#x2014;or (No. 2) trying to correct stereotypical depictions of Arabs in movies and TV. He lamented that they were seen as only &quot;belly dancers, bombers, and billionaires.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.v">Yes, he would sometimes explode at work. In one profanity-laced outburst, famously caught on tape, he sounded off about how hard it was to come straight out of the Pointer Sisters&#x2019; funky &quot;Dare Me&quot; to deliver a dedication to a Cincinnati man who had just buried &quot;a little dog named Snuggles.&quot; (&quot;They do this to me all the time,&quot; he griped. &quot;I don&#x2019;t know what the hell they do it for, but goddammit... I want somebody to use his fuckin&#x2019; brain to not come out of a goddamn record that is, uh, that&#x2019;s up-tempo, and I gotta talk about a fuckin&#x2019; <em>dog dying</em>.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.w">But even his exasperation made him more likable. It suggested that (No. 3) Kasem had taste. Besides, while he could be cantankerous, he was (No. 4) serious about self-improvement. He&#x2019;d completed Werner Erhard&#x2019;s est training in 1979, and in his off-hours he preferred tapes of gurus like Tony Robbins over any kind of music. He regretted that he hadn&#x2019;t been more vocal in his opposition to the Vietnam War (No. 5) and later spent considerable resources on political activism, supporting the Reverend Jackson&#x2019;s two bids for president (No. 6) and championing the rights of Palestinians to claim a homeland (No. 7). For many years, he taped his show just one day a week, devoting the rest of his time to causes that included fighting for the rights of homeless people (No. 8) and opposing nuclear proliferation (No. 9). And then there were his feelings about the afterlife (No. 10): According to his Lebanese Druze heritage, Kasem believed in reincarnation.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.x">But when his illness, diagnosed in 2007, began to erode his faculties, all that he&#x2019;d built up began to break down, and the mounting rancor within the Kasem family only made his decline sadder and more poignant. As his life moved haltingly toward its conclusion, it was hard not to think about how, for four decades, Kasem had ended every show with the phrase &quot;Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars.&quot; Now he was living another, much bleaker kind of countdown.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.y">After Jean removed Casey from the Santa Monica convalescent hospital, Logan Clarke, the P.I., got a frantic call from Kerri and began the process of tracking Jean down. A few days later, one of Jean&#x2019;s attorneys reported that the ailing legend was out of the country. That wasn&#x2019;t true. Jean, it turned out, had driven him to what has to be the last city on earth you&#x2019;d think to take a dying man: Las Vegas, where the couple, their daughter, and two caregivers occupied three suites at the Vdara Hotel &amp; Spa, just off the Strip. (Later, in court papers, Jean would say that she&#x2019;d taken Casey on &quot;vacation&quot; to &quot;escape the theatrical antics of Kerri Kasem for a few days and realize some peace and privacy.&quot;) Kasem was not examined by a physician for nearly a week.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.z">It&#x2019;s hard to imagine what Jean was thinking. Best case? She was somehow in denial about the sorry state of her husband&#x2019;s health and hoped a weekend getaway would bring him happiness. The worst case: She was on the run, determined to hide his deteriorating physical condition, now exacerbated by neglect. By the time she chartered a jet to Seattle on May 13, Kasem was malnourished; according to court documents, she had attempted to feed him by pouring Ensure, a nutritional supplement, into his feeding tube. Back in California, he&#x2019;d had no open wounds. Now he had a painful new bedsore on his coccyx, bigger than a saucer, and a urinary-tract infection.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.10">When the plane landed in Seattle, an ambulance was waiting on the tarmac. The driver took one look at Kasem and presumed they were headed for the hospital. Instead, Jean asked to be taken to a private residence, a three-bedroom ranch house. The ambulance driver alerted adult protective services; bedsores can be a sign of neglect. When Clarke noticed an alert on a law-enforcement database, the mystery of Kasem&#x2019;s whereabouts was solved, at least temporarily.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.11">On May 12, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge had granted Kerri temporary conservatorship over her father&#x2019;s medical care, and a week and a half later, a Washington judge upheld that order. But when Kerri headed north from Los Angeles to finally see her dad. Jean, who had hired a group of leather-clad veterans on motorcycles to protect the house, refused to let her in. Eventually, Kerri was allowed to visit her father. At Jean&#x2019;s request, a judge also ordered that &quot;photos taken of Mr. Kasem during visits shall not be disseminated.&quot; But a few hours later, Jean did something that many saw as a far more egregious violation of her husband&#x2019;s privacy: She held a press conference at which she played audio of her husband moaning. She claimed he was upset about the judge&#x2019;s ruling.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.12">&quot;He&#x2019;s crying,&quot; Jean said, accusing the courts of trying to &quot;rip him away from his family.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.13">Kerri saw it differently. &quot;My dad was moaning because he had a bedsore bigger than the size of my hand&#x2014;almost to the bone,&quot; she told me. &quot;He was moaning because he had a bladder infection and she had no painkillers.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.14">On June 1, Kerri showed up at the Seattle house with an ambulance and a team of medical personnel to transport him to a nearby hospital. As Liberty shrieked, &quot;Where are you taking my father??&quot; Jean came out into the yard, raised a camera to her face to chronicle the event, and called Kerri an &quot;intrusive psycho.&quot; Then she threw a pound of ground chuck in Kerri&#x2019;s direction while muttering about &quot;King David.&quot; One phrase she recited over and over&#x2014;&quot;To the dogs! To the dogs!&quot;&#x2014;led some of the many, many people following this saga to speculate that she meant to liken Kasem&#x2019;s kids to canine carnivores feeding on her dying husband. Or perhaps she was alluding to the Bible&#x2019;s Psalm 59, attributed by some to King David? (&quot;Deliver me from mine enemies.... Let them make a noise like a dog.... Let them wander up and down for meat.&quot;) Only Jean Kasem could tell you for sure, and maybe not even her.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.15">By the time Kerri got her father to St. Anthony Hospital near Seattle, he was alert but in critical condition. For the next two weeks, as the extended family gathered around Kasem&#x2019;s bedside (minus Jean and Liberty, except for one short visit), Kerri and Casey&#x2019;s court-appointed attorney consulted with doctors about what medical interventions were in his best interest. Not surprisingly, there was more than one document that supposedly specified Kasem&#x2019;s wishes, and they conflicted. Jean argued then, and argues to this day, that Kasem would have wanted to be kept alive via artificial nutrition and hydration. But by then Kerri had won control of the decision-making, and Jean wasn&#x2019;t there.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.16">By the second week of June, attempts to hydrate Kasem were causing his lungs to fill with fluid, virtually drowning him. Soon he was removed from artificial sustenance and was given morphine to make him comfortable. Finally, on June 15, surrounded by his three eldest children and his brother, he died.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.17"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.18">&quot;Jean cut his life short,&quot; Mouner Kasem, Casey&#x2019;s younger brother, told me. &quot;We could still have him today if she didn&#x2019;t do what she did.&quot; Casey&#x2019;s health was deteriorating, to be sure, Mouner said. &quot;But she killed him a lot quicker than he would have went.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.19">In the six months since Kerri hired him, Logan Clarke has made it his mission to get law enforcement to investigate Jean on charges of elder abuse. Even after months of little apparent progress, he still has high hopes, he says, that a Los Angeles Police Department probe will lead to criminal charges. &quot;Jean Kasem killed Casey Kasem,&quot; Clarke tells me. &quot;And she will be arrested. You mark my words.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1a">That seems unlikely. Despite a December TMZ report that claimed the LAPD had submitted its investigation to the L.A. County D.A.&#x2019;s elder-abuse section, the D.A.&#x2019;s office told <em>GQ</em> that &quot;a case has not been presented to our office&quot; and sent us back to the LAPD, which did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1b">Still, that hasn&#x2019;t stopped Clarke and Kasem&#x2019;s kids from trying. In the weeks after he passed, they sought to have an autopsy conducted on Kasem&#x2019;s body, hoping to prove that Jean&#x2019;s alleged neglect reached a criminal level. But before they could get permission, Jean sent a cavalcade of vehicles to the Tacoma funeral home where Kasem&#x2019;s corpse lay: His bizarre journey, it turned out, was far from over. As was her legal right as Kasem&#x2019;s spouse, Jean then removed his body and took it...well, no one knew where. For weeks, Kasem was missing. Again. Clarke started looking for him. Again.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1c">On July 15, he got the break he needed when officials in Washington issued a death certificate that said Kasem had been sent to Montreal. A French-speaking associate of Clarke&#x2019;s telephoned the Urgel Bourgie funeral home to confirm that Kasem was there. &quot;He called the main office under an assumed identity and was able to determine that, quote-unquote, Casey Kasem is in the deep freeze,&quot; Clarke told me.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1d">For several weeks, Kasem&#x2019;s elder kids tried to determine whether they could somehow get permission to bring their father&#x2019;s body home. But before they did, a Norwegian journalist, Marcus Husby, broke the news that Kasem was on his way to yet <em>another</em> foreign city: Oslo. Jean had sent a letter to Norwegian authorities requesting permission to bury her husband there, claiming that Kasem &quot;always said that Norway symbolizes peace and looks like heaven.&quot; (His eldest kids say they don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d ever been there.) Jean also said she had Norwegian roots and that she planned to move to Norway &quot;by the end of the year.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1e">Clarke says Jean&#x2019;s motives are simple: She hopes to dispose of her husband&#x2019;s remains outside the U.S. in order to &quot;avoid detection of the physical damage she had done to him.&quot; In mid-August, Kerri wrote a letter asking Norwegian officials to refuse to bury her father, saying that Kasem&#x2019;s true wish was to be buried at Forest Lawn cemetery in Los Angeles, his home of fifty-three years. The letter was signed by twenty Kasem family members and friends and accompanied by a petition signed by more than 30,000 people.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c946e52bc4b477a9d83a/master/w_806/life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg" alt="life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flast-days-of-casey-kasem&amp;t=life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flast-days-of-casey-kasem&amp;t=life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flast-days-of-casey-kasem&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c946e52bc4b477a9d83a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flast-days-of-casey-kasem&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c946e52bc4b477a9d83a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-02-casey-kasem-casey-kasem-gq-magazine-february-2015-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Ron Galella/ Wire Image/ Getty Images</div></figcaption></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1h">When I first spot her, Jean Kasem does not look anything like I expected. Throughout her marriage to Kasem, when they were often photographed together on red carpets and at awards shows, her fashion sense was as eccentric as it was legendary&#x2014;<em>I Dream of Jeannie</em> hairpieces and dreadlocked wigs, headdresses and top hats, fake flowers and sequined cleavage. By contrast, the woman who walks into a Los Angeles courtroom one Monday morning in September is a study in moneyed restraint: Her white-blonde hair is stick straight and set off by a turtleneck sweater, long skirt, boots, and Chanel spectacles&#x2014;all of them black. The only flash of color is the bright red patent leather Louis Vuitton bag whose handles she clutches with one hand. With the other hand, she holds on to Liberty.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1i">If Liberty had been born a boy, her father wanted to name her Justice, and justice is what she says she&#x2019;s come to court to get. A stud in her nose and chipped purple-red nail polish on her fingers, she has the puffy eyes of a girl who&#x2019;s been crying for days, and soon she&#x2019;s weeping again. Mascara streaks down her face as she accuses her half siblings of neglect, religious fanaticism, murder. &quot;They&#x2019;re all Scientologists, and they killed my dad for money,&quot; she says as her mother grips her shoulders from behind. &quot;They had him for twenty-four hours, and they took away all food, water, and medication, and he lasted two weeks. Can you <em>imagine?</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1j">Kasem has been dead for months now, but the accusations Liberty is flinging are largely the same ones made in a declaration her mother filed almost a year before. In that document, Jean described the elder Kasem children as a &quot;toxic&quot; presence that had &quot;irreparably shattered the lives of their father, his wife and youngest daughter.&quot; Later she would allege that Kerri owed her father money, that she had made a living by being involved in &quot;soft-core pornography&quot; (apparently a reference to Kerri&#x2019;s appearance in <em>Maxim</em>), and that as a Scientologist, she believed in &quot;an alien warlord&quot; and wanted to give Kasem&#x2019;s fortune to the church. (Kerri denies that latter bit but will not comment on her religious beliefs, saying she&#x2019;s &quot;interested in many faiths.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1k">I want to ask Jean about this, and about 600 or so other things, which is why I&#x2019;ve showed up at the courthouse, at her suggestion, to finally sit down and talk. For months I&#x2019;ve been asking for her side of the story. I want to hear Jean&#x2019;s version of her battle with Kerri, which, at least from a legal standpoint, has been truly epic and insanely expensive: Over the past year and a half, according to court documents, Jean has gone through a remarkable thirteen different sets of attorneys. The court record reveals a pattern: She hires a firm, there&#x2019;s a blast of filings, and then a few months later the lawyers ask the judge to be removed. (Jean&#x2019;s current counsel did not respond to <em>GQ&#x2019;</em>s requests for comment.)</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1l">I want to ask Jean about her alleged younger boyfriend, a Canadian named John Paul Gressy, who&#x2019;d been living in the Kasems&#x2019; oceanfront Malibu condo and driving Casey&#x2019;s Mercedes SUV for more than a year before Kasem died, according to Logan Clarke. And above all, I want to ask how it could ever be considered a good idea to take a very ill man who can barely speak or eat and discharge him from a convalescent hospital in the middle of the night, after disconnecting a surgically implanted feeding tube.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1m">At one point, Jean texted me to offer &quot;an exclusive&quot;; another time, she addressed me, oddly, as &quot;a colleague&quot; and asked me to recommend a publicist. But she always stops short of an in-depth interview. Now she demurs again, citing emotional exhaustion. Later she will text me, &quot;I have some breaking news for you if you can hang on a little longer.&quot; And then: &quot;I would love to participate but only if the article is truthful and accurate. If it is not a thorough article, then I must respectfully decline.&quot; She says she might relent if I will send her a list of everyone I&#x2019;ve interviewed. At that point, it&#x2019;s my turn to respectfully decline.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1n"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1o">Casey Kasem may be dead, but his voice lives on. In September, Kerri went on Howard Stern&#x2019;s SiriusXM show, where they talked about her father, and Jean, and whom Kerri has had sex with (Corey Feldman) and whom she hasn&#x2019;t (Ryan Seacrest). And in the following weeks, Stern has taken several phone calls on the air from Kasem&#x2019;s corpse. Once the voice said he was calling from the Gaza Strip. Another time, he was in the tower of Big Ben, looking out over London. It was funny, sort of.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1p">Ask Kerri and she will tell you that the saga of her father&#x2019;s death isn&#x2019;t just a cautionary tale about the Kasem family, or about any other rich and famous people and their troubles. Lots of families, she says, find themselves in similar situations, and she has launched a foundation called Kasem Cares to support adult children whose ability to visit and communicate with an ailing family member has been terminated or obstructed by a stepparent or other legal caretaker.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1q">Meanwhile, everyone has been in court (of course) arguing over how much of the case&#x2019;s gargantuan legal fees should be paid by Kasem&#x2019;s estate. And in a separate action, the company that carried Kasem&#x2019;s $4 million life-insurance policy, MetLife, has asked a judge to decide whom it should pay benefits to, since Jean, Liberty, and Casey&#x2019;s elder kids are all listed as beneficiaries. Predictably, each side is challenging the other side&#x2019;s right to collect.</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1r">And what of Kasem&#x2019;s corpse? Throughout the fall, it remained on ice, inspiring headlines like this one from TMZ: Casey Kasem Rotting in Norway. In October, the acting head of Oslo&#x2019;s burial agency told a local TV station that he was still awaiting &quot;a clear signal&quot; as to what to do. &quot;I&#x2019;ve never been involved in a similar case before,&quot; the official said, &quot;and I&#x2019;ve been working in this capacity for thirty years.&quot; There was no rush, he added: &quot;A body can lie a long time in the freezer.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1s">The Kasem kids grew tired of waiting. In November, they filed court papers asking a judge to force Jean to bring their father&#x2019;s remains back to U.S. soil. They were denied. Finally, just before Christmas, came word that Casey Kasem had been put to rest at the Vestre Cemetery in Oslo. His kids found out just like everyone else did: from a Norwegian news report complete with a photo of a snow-dusted grave, adorned by three wreaths. There was no headstone. Kerri immediately took to social media, saying Jean had &quot;conned&quot; the cemetery, and calling her &quot;abusive&quot; and &quot;unfaithful.&quot; &quot;How many more witnesses do you need...,&quot; she wrote in all caps. &quot;West Los Angeles Police Department where are you?!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1t">The eldest Kasem children console themselves with the idea that according to their father&#x2019;s Druze beliefs, he will soon be born again. As ghastly as it was to imagine his decomposing corpse, Kerri told me, &quot;he&#x2019;s not there anymore. Jean still thinks she owns his body. But he&#x2019;s with us. I feel him all the time. She can&#x2019;t hurt us or him ever again. Are you kidding? Lady, Dad&#x2019;s with us now.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1u">It&#x2019;s a comforting thought: the loved one finally laid to rest, not here nor there but everywhere; the countdown that never really stops. As Kasem said in his last broadcast, on July 4, 2009: <em>Over the years, musical trends have come and gone from disco to new wave, from punk to hip-hop, from bubblegum to rock. We&#x2019;ve been there, counting them down. It&#x2019;s been a great thirty-nine years, and it&#x2019;s really been an honor for me. But we&#x2019;re not finished yet.</em></p><p data-reactid=".29uspbla39c.1.1.0.0.4.1v"><strong><a href="../contributors/amy-wallace">AMY WALLACE</a></strong> <em>is a</em> GQ
