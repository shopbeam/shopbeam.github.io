  	    "articleBody": "It is a clement spring day in greater Los Angeles, and James Deen is driving through the soft green tumescences of the Calabasas hills on his way to a pornographic-movie shoot. If Deen betrays not a trace of anticipation, aversion, or excitement at the prospect of having sex on-camera today, it is because having sex on-camera is something the 26-year-old does more frequently than most of us use dental floss: \u0022About 360 days a year\u0022 is Deen\u0027s offhand tally. \u000A\u000ADeen\u0027s professional relentlessness has yielded a host of accolades. In 2009, when he was 23, the Adult Video News (AVN) Awards, pornography\u0027s Oscars, named Deen \u0022Male Performer of the Year.\u0022 (Deen was one of the youngest actors ever to be so decorated.) This on the heels of a similar distinction from the X-Rated Critics Organization, which in 2007 noted the arrival of a major talent with an \u0022Unsung Swordsman\u0022 award. \u000A\u000AIndustry plaudits aside, Deen has managed an order of renown far rarer in the world of pornographic film: He is a male performer people actually know by name. According to Deen, 10,000 unique visitors peruse his blog every day. Women seem to like him. A recent Nightline segment alerted parents to Deen\u0027s crossover appeal among teenage girls, who, the piece warned, hold for Deen a place in their hearts alongside Timberlake and Bieber. (Anchor Terry Moran: \u0022For any parent concerned about what their teen does online, the huge popularity of the young man you are about to meet may be deeply disturbing.\u0022)\u000A\u000AA visit to the comments section of Deen\u0027s website appears to confirm Nightline\u0027s claims:\u000A\u000A\u0022Hey James :) I\u0027m 16 years old and i love your work\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022hey (; have you EVER banged a teen latina ? e-mail me....\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022i would totally rock your world...mind you im 16 about to be 17.\u0022\u000A\u000ADeen brakes his truck at the bottom of a steep gated driveway, which leads to a sprawling mansion that looks made of nougat. Its dominant interior materials are faux gilt, beveled glass, and plastic flora. The game room, which is as big as my house, contains dartboards, a pool table, and a saloon area with a neon sign reading ICE CREAM fid above the mirrored back bar. The house\u0027s real-life owner, one supposes, is a fabulously well-to-do 14-year-old. \u000A\u000ABut today the mansion\u0027s fictive owner is James Deen himself, who has been cast in the role of a priapic millionaire with a gambling problem. The shoot is for a company called Digital Playground, which claims to specialize in \u0022high-end\u0022 pornography for couples—\u0022vanilla porn,\u0022 as hard-raunch aficionados dub DP\u0027s output.\u000A\u000A\u0022As far as making visually stimulating erotic cinema, Digital Playground\u0027s pretty much the best,\u0022 says Deen. \u0022Personally, I hate it. It\u0027s too pretty. When I\u0027m watching adult, I don\u0027t care about the lighting. I want to see dirty, nasty: Rocco Siffredi\u0022—an Italian porn star known for full-contact choreographies in which he dragoons pretty ladies into tonguing his caboose.\u000A\u000AOver the next seven days, Deen will exercise his full array of talents and preferences on seven projects in three cities—Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. I will be riding shotgun in Deen\u0027s utterly bitching pumpkin orange off-road-package Ford F-150 Raptor, watching him work, and trying to make sense of his extraordinary life. \u000A\u000AI have many questions:\u000A\u000AFirst off, brooking so much unremitting daily friction, how has James Deen\u0027s penis not been stropped to raw liver? \u0022I don\u0027t know. I guess I\u0027ve got pretty thick skin.\u0022\u000A\u000AHow does he keep his houseplants alive with so much travel? He doesn\u0027t. All the plants in Deen\u0027s 4,200-square-foot home in the San Fernando Valley have died.\u000A\u000AGosh, but mustn\u0027t Deen have an astonishing collection of venereal diseases? He and his colleagues undergo testing every month. Deen claims, incredibly, to never have had a test come back \u0022dirty.\u0022\u000A\u000ADoes he gobble Viagra like popcorn? Certainly not. His erections are 100 percent organic and pharma-free.\u000A\u000AA good portion of Deen\u0027s oeuvre consists of rather not-nice stuff: spitting, whipping, choking, slapping, etc. Is there anything he won\u0027t do on-camera? He will not have sex with someone who is unwilling to have sex with him. He will not have sex with men. He will not dress as a clown and have sex with someone; nor will he permit someone dressed as a clown to have sex with him. Clowns make James Deen uncomfortable. \u000A\u000AIsn\u0027t this sort of career exhausting physically, spiritually? Doesn\u0027t he sometimes wish he\u0027d picked another calling? No indeed. He loves his work. He\u0027d do it even if he weren\u0027t getting paid: \u0022My life is pretty awesome.\u0022\u000A\u000ALastly, a silent query to the nation\u0027s gentlemen, we who have spent many otherwise productive hours pondering what it would be like to be able to bed an infinite rotating population of beautiful women: If given the chance, would we live Deen\u0027s dream? For a day? For a week? Yes? We shall see. \u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000ALosing Kayden is the working title of today\u0027s film. Its centerpiece is an actress by the name of Kayden Kross, a wholly winning and improbably bookish young woman who reads the short fiction of David Foster Wallace between takes. The crew is far more substantial, congenial, and pro-seeming than one expected. There\u0027s no more ambient prurience than you\u0027d find at an ad shoot for Windex. \u000A\u000AA little after dusk, Deen is summoned to his first scene, a non-nude narrative load bearer in which he loses his mansion in a poker game with a gangster. Handling the role of the crime boss is a creepy German actor in his middle years named Steve Holmes, now parked at the card table. He wears a pair of granddad-ish EZ-reader glasses and below them a seedy mustache-and-goatee combo, and far below that a pair of dark trousers from whose open fly depends something like a turkey\u0027s wattle.\u000A\u000AThe third factor in the scene is a blonde 19-year-old named Allie James. Earlier, when I asked Allie James what she\u0027d be up to today, she replied, \u0022I\u0027ll be crawling around under a table sucking cock.\u0022\u000A\u000AAllie joined the industry six months ago after fleeing the family farm in upstate New York. With the exception of Steve Holmes, she\u0027s the only person on the set who flaunts her zeal for the erotic when the camera is not rolling. She roams the mansion with her shirt hiked up over her breasts. While the other scenes were being shot, neither Deen nor any of the other talent were the least bit interested in watching the action, but Allie liked to perch on the sidelines, insouciantly masturbating and checking her Facebook page and also chewing the heck out of some gum. \u000A\u000AWhile the crew is dragging lighting rigs and attending to last-minute particulars, James takes a seat at the poker table with Allie and Steve. Allie perches on Steve\u0027s engorged lap. Steve gets an idea: Wouldn\u0027t it be diverting if Allie James were to pose for a photograph with Steve\u0027s penis in her mouth, which Steve could text to Allie\u0027s mother? \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A __\u000A\u000AShe kneels. He snaps. \u0022He\u0027s gonna send it to my mom!\u0022 Allie cries with apparent delight.\u000A\u000A\u0022I want to fuck them both,\u0022 Steve Holmes explains, punching Allie\u0027s mother\u0027s number into his phone.\u000A\u000AWith minutes to go until go time, the cast talks shop. In response to a conversation starter I do not catch, Allie relates a childhood memory, the gist of which is that when she was 9 years old, hanging out with her brothers, she was encouraged to perform sexual acts for their friends in exchange for marijuana.\u000A\u000ANow Deen looks up from his telephone for the first time in quite a while.\u000A\u000A\u0022And you were cool with it?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, yeah,\u0022 says Allie James.\u000A\u000ADeen hoists his eyebrows. \u0022As long as you were cool with it,\u0022 he says. \u000A\u000A\u0022Okay, okay, let\u0027s focus!\u0022 booms the director, Robby D., an imposing, fearsomely bald man. The time for horseplay is at an end. It is time for acting now. \u0022So on ‘Action,\u0027you guys are playing poker—and you,\u0022 he says to Allie, \u0022you start sucking his dingy.\u0022\u000A\u000AClick goes the little scene-marker guillotine, the \u0022sticks.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe scene takes halting shape after Deen brooks a surprisingly rigorous Stanislavsky-ing from Robby D. (\u0022Try to find the character. He\u0027s a gambling addict. Nervous, edgy. Take your time. Check out the blow job.\u0022) Meanwhile, over by the ice cream bar, the crew reviews the tape and sniggers. Allie\u0027s blow job is deemed \u0022horrible,\u0022 for, as far as I can follow the logic, a dearth of audible gagging sounds. But anyway, it\u0027s not an important blow job—just some ornamental side action to mitigate the scene\u0027s dull plot load. The scene is a keeper. So while the crew sets up the next shot, Allie James fetches some paper towels and sponges up the squalid whey that has pooled about her knees.\u000A\u000ASeveral hours later, after midnight, Deen is finally summoned to perform. His scene is in an upstairs bedroom with Kayden Kross, who really does look lovely in her pink top and purple bra. Deen and Kross are old friends. Deen was not her first scene, but he was her third some years ago. On the heels of Allie James\u0027s unheartwarming ministrations, James and Kayden seem sweet, natural, and eager to hump for reasons having to do with actual interpersonal fondness.\u000A\u000AThey run through a bit of dialogue concerning James\u0027s gambling problem and then collide. James disrobes in medias. Nude, he looks even tinier than his elfin five feet eight. His body is about like an eighth grader\u0027s. His penis is smaller than a baguette.  \u000A\u000A\u0022You been working out?\u0022 Robby asks between takes.\u000A\u000A\u0022No,\u0022 says James. \u000A\u000A\u0022I didn\u0027t think so.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s true—no rippling sinews are visible on James Deen\u0027s body. There are probably 12-year-old girls who could take him in a fight. And this, Deen tells me, is partly the secret of his success. He is not the traditional porno man, no overbulked squat-thruster spray-broasted from the Darque Tan booth. He is sort of wimpy-looking. With luminous blue eyes and well-structured, stubble-flocked cheekbones, he is handsome, but in an everyday, non-Hollywood way. \u0022Not horrible to look at\u0022 is how Deen describes his appearance. \u0022I\u0027m like a guy a chick might actually meet in a bar.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat Deen\u0027s very ordinariness is somehow a virtue in the industry is, one could argue, a symptom of pornography\u0027s journey from unsanitary movie theaters and paper-windowed bookstores to every computer screen the free world over. A theory: Back in the days when the culture could pretend that porn was being exclusively consumed by sex criminals and raincoaters, viewing pornography was actually a multilayered form of voyeurship. The chief thrill was, of course, watching people screw, but salting that thrill was a Lovelace-ian paratext of unhappiness, addiction, disease, etc. The fact that the performers were doomed and loathed, if hypocritically, by mainstream culture made them more exciting to watch. That female performers should be made to couple with satanic reptiles like John Holmes or Ron Jeremy was just, fitting, gross, and perversely harmonious with the moral aesthetic of the age.\u000A\u000AIn the 1980s and \u002790s, the grodiness of the male talent migrated somewhat, from Holmes-style Swamp Things to steroidal Fabioids. But still, the pornographic fantasy seemed to be happening among people not exactly of our species, on a planet where nude women languish in wait for pizza men who look like courtiers from Castle Grayskull. \u000A\u000ASo enter the present age, when almost everyone is watching porn (two in five U.S. Internet users—125 million—visit an adult site each month), when American porn sites reportedly receive 28,000 unique hits every second, when the AVN estimates that a third of consistent porn viewers are women. Now that pretty much every man (if not woman and child) is watching porn, there is at last demand for a pornographic Everyman in the form of James Deen, whose regular dudeness acknowledges that his world is our world and our world is Planet Porn.\u000A\u000AAnyway, sorry for talking while you\u0027re trying to concentrate. Back at it: Deen does away with Miss Kross\u0027s panties. She spread-eagles on the edge of the bed, and Deen commences a kalimba move on her vulva. Then comes what I soon recognize as Deen\u0027s default prelude: a deft bit of multitasking in which he launches into a cunnilinctory overture with his legs in a sprinter-at-the-blocks posture. This affords him latitude to hand-crank himself rigid below the camera frame. Small and swart, snacking avidly on Miss Kross, Deen vaguely favors the incubus in Fuseli\u0027s The Nightmare.  \u000A\u000AAfter a brief interval of manual pump priming, he breaks off the oral business, which now, in its frantic lateralness, has begun to resemble an impassioned harmonica solo. The derricking begins. Kayden Kross is posed in a swastika of shapely limbs. He toils, leans his face into hers, and the two murmur to each other in a guttural lock-jawed patois intelligible to no one but themselves. Every now and then, the two of them break into heliated laughter, as though to say, \u0022All of this grunting and grasping and fuck-me fuck-me porno jabber is a bit absurd, isn\u0027t it? But jeepers, chum, it really is awfully nice to be having sex with you.\u0022 \u000A\u000A\u0022I wish I got to stick my dick in some chick\u0027s fuckin\u0027 pussy,\u0022 one of the crew members reflects bitterly. This attitude is perhaps shared by readers at home. But it soon becomes clear why neither the cameraman nor you nor I will ever get to have our trousers off near Miss Kross. \u000A\u000AAfter several frictive minutes, the action stops. The still photographer comes in and for fifteen minutes or so arranges James and Kayden into assorted tableaux, and all the while James\u0027s gizmo stands as steadfast as the Chrysler Building. Then the action resumes, only this time it\u0027s for a soft-core version (inside factoid: The blue movies you see on late-night cable? The actors are actually having sex), followed by another ten minutes or so of intimate strife and moanery, before they at last go back to the full and flagrant penetrative churn. Finally Robby calls, \u0022Okay, let\u0027s bring it home. BJ, then pop.\u0022\u000A\u000AWithin a few fleeting moments, presto: Deen is punctually drizzling genetic material onto Kayden\u0027s adorable face.\u000A\u000AAnd cut. \u0022I got come up my nose and my eyeball,\u0022 Kayden says in a tone not of displeasure. \u0022It was so good. I love James.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd James? Would he work with her again, someone asks.\u000A\u000A\u0022Fuck no,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AKayden snorts in mock umbrage. \u0022I\u0027ll rape you if you don\u0027t.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AAt 2:30 a.m., Losing Kayden is pronounced a wrap. The crew coils cable. While the cast goes home, Deen heads to his ginormous pickup truck and sets a course for San Francisco, where he is needed on set twelve hours from now. A journalist in the passenger\u0027s seat, having spectated on live sex acts for the first time in his life, about a dozen solid hours\u0027 worth, is suffering not wholly agreeable reelings of the mind that he tries to cover for with ninnyish small talk.\u000A\u000A\u0022So that scene with Kayden seemed, ah, pretty enjoyable.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah,\u0022 Deen says. \u0022I always say sex is like soccer: It\u0027s fun and athletic, and you should do it with your friends.\u0022\u000A\u000AYes, I think. Right. Certainly. Here is a simple statement that Deen means pretty much as it sounds, but it also pithily expresses yet another reason why you or I will never be the sort of soccer player James Deen is. It\u0027s not just that he\u0027s got bigger, you know, feet than we do. It\u0027s that for you, on that night of enduring awkwardness when you went out for drinks with the woman in the adjacent cubicle and achieved your long-cherished fantasy of playing soccer with her, you did so not because you thought she was going to be this tremendously good soccer player. It was that you were thrilled that she found you sufficiently nonrevolting that she was willing to get on the field with you, which was a big consideration, because as you both knew, what makes the game so very, very exciting isn\u0027t its competitive physics but the conceit that the game is actually a high-velocity delivery system for privileged emotional knowledge of the other player\u0027s secret self. And that even if you\u0027re the sort of freebooting venereal Olympian who tries to play soccer with absolutely everything that moves, your compulsion to play is still ultimately grounded in the marrow-level conviction that the game matters in some way a good deal more complex and high-stakes than simple athletic fun. \u000A\u000ABut the remarkable thing about Deen is, I think, that he has managed to dissociate sex from emotional consequence, a feat of psychosexual contortionism he was limbering up for at an age when the rest of us had yet to tie our own shoelaces. \u000A\u000AQ: So when did you decide to do porn?\u000A\u000AA: Kindergarten. I remember I was walking home one day, and I found this magazine, I don\u0027t know, a Hustler or something, with people banging in it. I was enamored by it. I was like, I want to do this. I actually got in trouble in third or fourth grade. They were asking everybody what they wanted to be when they grew up, and I said I wanted to be a porn star. They didn\u0027t like that. They thought I was being a dick. I was like, \u0022I\u0027m not being a dick, it\u0027s just what I want to be.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut outside of porn, before he entered the industry, what else interested him? \u0022Nothing. That\u0027s the thing. My whole life, I\u0027ve never really found anything else that I\u0027ve found interesting.\u0022\u000A\u000AJames Deen, whose real name is Bryan Sevilla, grew up in Pasadena, California. His parents are both, after a fashion, rocket scientists. His father is a mechanical engineer for NASA. His mother does data analysis for the space agency. Deen, contrary to our notion of porn stars as survivors of sexual trauma, does not recall any sexual abuse or destructive misadventures, other than a teacher who Deen says tried to molest him when he was 8 or 9, but Deen \u0022punched his testicles a lot\u0022 and made good his escape. \u000A\u000ADeen lost his virginity at age 12 during a sleepover at a Jewish camp. Not long after, in junior high school, he made enemies of the football team by having sex with a player\u0027s sister in the school pool during gym. He had some drug escapades in junior high. He spent a couple of years in outpatient rehab. Around age 15, he left high school and moved out and spent two years more or less homeless, hanging around with a crew of gutter punks. Relations with his parents remained reasonably cordial. They furnished him with a cell phone, and he periodically snuck into his mom\u0027s house to do laundry. (Deen\u0027s parents are divorced.)\u000A\u000AAt around 17, he moved in with his father. He was working at a Starbucks and taking classes at a community college when one evening he says he chanced upon a call-in radio program whose guest was the porn star Jenna Jameson. She imparted what was, for Deen, life-altering advice.\u000A\u000A\u0022So some guy calls in for like the millionth time and says, ‘I wanna do porn. How do I get into the industry?\u0027 And she\u0027s been listening to this shit all night. She\u0027s frustrated. She goes, ‘You wanna do porn? Go get a folding chair and sit in a room with twenty people and jerk off for an hour. And if you can keep hard, and when one of them yells \u0022Come!\u0022 you can come in thirty seconds, then you can do porn.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ADeen hearkened to these words. He began a self-styled apprenticeship in not-for-profit guerrilla pornography. \u0022I started going to parties, and I\u0027d bang girls in front of groups of people,\u0022 he recalled. \u0022I learned I could come on cue. I was told to come, and I\u0027d come. I don\u0027t know how I do it. It has something to do with muscle control. It\u0027s easy for me.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn 2004 a stripper Deen knew introduced him to a casting agent who posted his naked picture on the World Wide Web. In short order, Deen was offered a role to be the recipient of something \u0022more than a hand job but less than a blow job.\u0022 He acquitted himself creditably. His career had begun. His agent thought \u0022Clint Cunnilingus\u0022 was a poor choice of screen name. Bryan Sevilla instead became James Deen, inspired by the nickname he won in junior high school for the soigné manner in which he liked to pinch-cup a cigarette.\u000A\u000A In due time, a director offered the young aspirant his first full scene. The wood was durable, the orgasm prompt. Deen had proved himself a fellow of Miss Jameson\u0027s calling. Jobs poured in. (Deen wouldn\u0027t disclose his earnings, but top male talent can command $800 to $1,000 a scene.)  \u000A\u000AThough you could not hire a lobbyist to boost for the porn industry more enthusiastically than James Deen, he does acknowledge that the life has its pitfalls. On our ride north, I mention what will be, for me, the least forgettable or pleasant image of the week I spend with him: that of Allie James posed with Steve Holmes\u0027s organ in a photo for her mother.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, obviously she\u0027s damaged. I\u0027m, like, getting pimped out when you were 9 so your brothers could smoke weed? That\u0027s not healthy. She\u0027s like Rick Santorum\u0027s wet dream, the poster child for how people in porn are damaged,\u0022 Deen says. \u0022But for every person like her, there\u0027s someone like, I\u0027d like to say, me. I had a great childhood. My parents and I get along. I just like sex, and I like porn, and I think it\u0027s fun. I\u0027m always terrified that someday I\u0027m going to come to the realization that I\u0027ve got some deep, dark secret, some terrifying, horrible experience where I\u0027m going to be like, ‘I\u0027m actually not normal. I\u0027m a crazy person!\u0027 But it just doesn\u0027t seem to be the case.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe Santorum poster children are, as Deen has it, performers who \u0022lose their real persona and become their porn persona, this party person who is obsessed with sex, who is constantly taking their clothes off.\u0022\u000A\u000AI suggest to Deen that perhaps the reason Bryan Sevilla hasn\u0027t manifested persona slip when he became James Deen is that Sevilla—the kindergarten porn enthusiast, preteen industry aspirant, the public coupler at social functions—has always been James Deen.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027d agree with that,\u0022 he says. \u000A\u000AAnd on we roll, north on I-5, yours truly dozing off while Deen blares on his superb sound system, at 3,000 dBs, his favorite tune: \u0022Yes\u0022 by LMFAO, whose refrain runs, Every day I see my dream.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AJames Deen arrives in San Francisco with the morning traffic. His destination is the Mission District headquarters of the sex conglomerate Kink.com. If Digital Playground is vanilla, Kink.com is decidedly rocky road. Kink\u0027s family of websites includes but is not limited to Hogtied.com, BoundGangBangs.com, ButtMachineBoys.com, BoundInPublic.com, PublicDisgrace.com, NakedKombat.com, WiredPussy.com, and ElectroSluts.com. \u000A\u000AAccording to Deen, Kink is among the most profitable companies in the porn industry, owing to its extraordinarily loyal consumer base of fetishists. A fetish, Deen explains, is not a mere preference or lark but a controlling obsession. A fetishist cannot enjoy himself sexually unless he is observing, for example, someone\u0027s vagina getting jazzed with 110 volts of house current. \u0022The people who watch it don\u0027t watch because they want to, they watch it because they need to,\u0022 Deen says.\u000A\u000AContent for Kink\u0027s assorted websites is mostly filmed on location at a former National Guard armory, a forbidding Moorish Revival fortress at 14th and Mission that Kink purchased in 2006 for $14.5 million. Today, Deen will be filming a scene in the armory\u0027s basement for EverythingButt.com. \u0022It\u0027s about butts,\u0022 Deen explains. \u0022It\u0027s normally girl-girl. The girls play with each other, insert various objects into each other\u0027s rectums, and then I show up and bang them in their butts and call it a day. It\u0027s not one of my favorites, because there\u0027s not much actual sex.\u0022\u000A\u000AFor all of Kink\u0027s outré offerings, the armory actually feels a good deal less porny than the glitzy loaner mansion we were in last night. More Williamsburg than San Fernando Valley. People we pass in the hallways look like bike messengers, librarians, and assistant faculty in women\u0027s-studies departments. \u000A\u000AThe armory contains an uncountable number of studios made to simulate bars and dungeons and karate dojos. Deen makes his way to the basement. He cocks an ear to a studio door where the scene he\u0027ll be joining is already steaming along. Through the plywood, we can hear a woman voicing hysterical testimony as to the condition and surrendered proprietorship of her tuchus. \u0022Whose ass is it?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s your ass.... My ass is yours!\u0022\u000A\u000ADeen and I—haggard, malarial with sleep deprivation—doze nearby on a pair of sofas without a care for the deeds that have surely soiled the upholstery. \u000A\u000AWithin the hour, Deen is summoned to the set, which is a genuine industrial-age boiler room. It contains an actual boiler, a steel-frame single bed suggestive of an old-timey insane asylum, an equipment table bearing whips, a lengthy, diametrically graduated recto-probe, dildos, and an alligator\u0027s head. Personnel includes the director—a mild, soft-spoken man with fine Teutonic features—and a cameraman in a full jumpsuit as per OSHA regulations. There is also Isis Love, administrator of the anatomical stresses we were overhearing during our nap. Isis is a tawny Amazon with black sheeny hair and a black corsetish thing tailored to expose breasts like a pair of headlocked toddlers. The scene\u0027s operational subject is a young woman named Proxy Paige, a slightly mousy hipster type. Fishnets and silver bustier notwithstanding, she looks like a civilian. I\u0027m worried about her.\u000A\u000APregame particulars are attended to. Deen conducts a brief interview with Proxy Paige as to her personal boundaries. Proxy says she lately had some wisdom-tooth trouble on one side of her jaw and would prefer not to be slapped there. Anything else is cool. Then Deen, by way of small talk, recounts yesterday\u0027s Steve-Holmes-texting-the-fellatio-photo-to-Allie-James\u0027s-mother anecdote, to which Proxy Paige replies that she would like \u0022to fuck [Steve] and his son so bad it makes me uncomfortable,\u0022 which assures me that whatever further abuse the afternoon holds for Proxy Paige, she can hack it just fine. \u000A\u000ALights, camera—before filming begins, the scene founders. Deen is rigid and all, but syntactical confusion halts the choreography. \u0022When you come in,\u0022 Isis says to Deen, \u0022I\u0027ll be licking her ass, getting her ass all wet so you can fuck her while she\u0027s sucking your cock.\u0022\u000A\u000ADeen looks at Isis Love like, Say what? \u0022I don\u0027t know how big you think my cock is,\u0022 Deen says. \u0022I don\u0027t know how I can fuck her while she\u0027s sucking my cock. It won\u0027t, like, go through her.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022No, no,\u0022 says Isis Love. \u0022I\u0027ll be licking her ass and getting her ass all spitty so you can fuck her while she\u0027s sucking your cock.\u0022\u000A\u000APardon?\u000A\u000AAfter some back-and-forth, Deen roots out the source of the perplexity, a misplaced \u000A\u000A temporal clause, \u0022Oh, you\u0027re going to lick her ass [preparatory to coitus] while she\u0027s sucking my cock.\u0022 \u000A\u000AYes, yes, that\u0027s it precisely. \u000A\u000AAction: The scene begins with Proxy kneeling on the floor and fellating. Isis and Deen stand on either side of her such that Isis, by humping the back of Proxy\u0027s head, compels Proxy to repeatedly spindle her gullet on Deen\u0027s person. That goes on for a while, and then Deen, wang still endentured, sort of drags Proxy over to the bed in a maneuver reminiscent of what we used to refer to in junior high school as a \u0022bulldog.\u0022 Isis Love stands close at hand, emitting a faultfinding commentary of ungentle encouragement, \u0022Keep it in your mouth, slut,\u0022 etc., etc.\u000A\u000AUm, hey. You out there, do you seriously want me to keep describing this stuff? Really? Because it gets a lot worse from here. All right, you asked for it. \u000A\u000A\u0022Okay!\u0022 says Isis Love. \u0022Time for the human centipede.\u0022 The \u0022human centipede\u0022 = Deen sodomizing Proxy Paige while Proxy Paige buries her face between the russet buttocks of Isis Love in a snuffling pantomime of a \u0022Kilroy was here\u0022 graffito. Isis at regular intervals hocks lubricative loogies into the pistonworks going full-bore at the base of Proxy\u0027s spine. Every now and again Isis disengages Deen\u0027s cruller so that the camera can get a load of Proxy\u0027s keister, which footage you should track down if you happen to adore the sight of a yawning, defanged lamprey with strep throat. \u000A\u000AFrom there, in flagrant contravention of the USDA\u0027s Safe Food Handling Fact Sheet, Deen plunges his unwashed tuber straightaway into Proxy\u0027s mouth. A set of chain-linked nipple clamps are attached to poor Proxy. Deen yanks roguishly on the chain while Isis covers Proxy\u0027s nose and mouth, depriving her of oxygen. While Deen pays a return visit to Proxy\u0027s service entrance, Isis Love manages to slip a searching finger or two in there as well.  \u000A\u000AAt this point, an unlearned onlooker might adjudge Proxy\u0027s hindmost to be quite adequately crammed, perhaps even crammed to excess. But Deen, whose right hand is stuffed into Proxy\u0027s mouth noodlin\u0027-for-flatheads-style, manages to wedge a few additional digits into Proxy\u0027s exhaust port. \u000A\u000A\u0022You are so fucking sick and evil and twisted and fucked-up,\u0022 Isis says to Deen. \u0022I fucking love you.\u0022 \u000A\u000AProxy\u0027s breathing is stertorous, rapid, pre-infarctatory. Between takes she\u0027s asked if she\u0027s okay. She nods. Her eyes leak little tears, which Deen wipes away with the quick strokes of an experienced cut man. Before long, Deen is instructed to ejaculate, which he does, with dispatch, on Proxy\u0027s face. \u000A\u000AAnd cut! We\u0027re clear! Thank heavens.\u000A\u000ADeen flees the set in search of a shower. Isis and Proxy sit abed for a postgame interview. \u000A\u000AIsis Love: Proxy, how you feeling right now?\u000A\u000AProxy Paige: [panting] Good! Worked over.\u000A\u000AIsis: Was it everything you expected it to be?\u000A\u000AProxy: Yes, and I got to do a lot of things I hadn\u0027t done before.\u000A\u000A[Proxy is breathing heavily. Her voice is fragile, muted with restrained emotion.]\u000A\u000AIsis: Do you want to cry right now? Come here, munchkin. \u000A\u000AIsis Love holds Proxy Paige while the brine flows from her eyes. \u0022It was a really good day,\u0022 Proxy says, her voice splintering. \u0022I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m crying. It was really extreme, and I did a lot of things I don\u0027t normally do.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You\u0027re so cute,\u0022 says Isis. \u0022What was the best part of the day? Your favorite part.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You fisting me,\u0022 says Proxy. \u0022I\u0027ve always wanted to be, like, fully fisted in the ass. I felt like that would cross some sort of, like, anal threshold, and I finally did it. It was intense.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Can I have a tissue for my munchkin pie?\u0022 Isis calls to the crew. Isis Love cradles Proxy Paige, and Proxy does the only thing one can do when you\u0027ve survived such an afternoon as this, which is to weep and grin and weep.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AAs soon as he\u0027s out of the shower, Deen aims the F-150 Vegasward. We\u0027re on the road by 7 p.m. The trip\u0027s supposed to take nine or ten hours, but James Deen\u0027s preferred number of miles per hour at which to drive is one hundred. We make it in six hours and change. \u000A\u000AOn the darkened highway, we discuss Deen\u0027s life offscreen. Does James Deen have a girlfriend? He does not, not as of this writing, anyway. For six years he dated the alt-porn innovatrix Joanna Angel, but seeing civilians is generally rather ved. \u0022Either they get freaked-out about what I do before they get a chance to get to know me, or they just want to have sex like one time so they can say they fucked a porn star.\u0022 \u000A\u000ADeen\u0027s boyfriend-girlfriend-type arrangements, therefore, have generally been with other sex-industry professionals. In theory, says Deen, \u0022when you\u0027re in a relationship with someone in the industry, all of the jealousy and everything should fall away.\u0022 But of course, when you and your significant other are having sex with third, fourth, fifth, etc., parties for money every day, other complexities crop up. I promised Deen I would not get into the interpersonal specifics he disclosed on our many hours road-tripping together, but I will say that his relationships have been plagued by complications that have never troubled the marriage of Ann and Mitt Romney. Lately, having sex off-camera has been sort of fraught. \u0022Personal private sex is almost too intimate now,\u0022 he says, citing a recent threesome when he was \u0022like almost hyperemotional, because it was personal sex without any cameras.\u0022 \u000A\u000AAt 8 a.m., Deen arrives at a shoot for Brazzers, a Lumbourg-based pornography concern that traffics in more traditional fare than Kink.com, with such online properties as PornstarsLikeItBig.com, MilfsLikeItBig.com, TeensLikeItBig.com, MommyGotBoobs.com, BabyGotBoobs.com, and other improvisations on these core motifs. \u000A\u000AThe studio is out by the airport, in a structure you could confidently nominate in a global architectural showdown for World\u0027s Most Nondescript Building. Inside is a labyrinth of offices in various states of half-assed theatrical reinvention as hospital or hotel or school rooms. Casually scattered about are props from old shoots: a cardboard retail booth bearing the exhortation eat a sister\u0027s pie, a trombone, a sorority paddle stenciled with the words cunta beta deltas, a Sawzall with a dildo fid to the bayonet end. \u000A\u000ADeen is greeted by the director, who goes by the name Vic Lagina. Vic is tall, phlegmatic, wearing a half-sleeve baseball shirt through which large, hard pectorals are legible. Vic Lagina gives James Deen the rundown on today\u0027s script, which is Lagina\u0027s own creation. It\u0027s a 1980s rock \u0027n\u0027 roll-biopic spoof with Deen playing the part of a dissolute rocker. \u0022Dewey Cocks\u0022 is his character\u0027s name.\u000A\u000AFor today\u0027s role, Deen is costumed in an unctuous black sternum-length wig, a slinky black halter top, and a pair of white tiger-print tights that accentuate the acreage of Deen\u0027s organ. \u0022Man, those pants make your dick look big,\u0022 observes Vic Lagina.\u000A\u000AAs another member of the Brazzers crew points out, Deen\u0027s stature helps enhance the appearance of genital yardage. \u0022It\u0027s like putting twenty-twos on a Civic.\u0022\u000A\u000AQuiet on the set. The first shot is this: Deen leaning against a wall to simulate an existential moment backstage. A stagehand comes along to urge him to perform. Then Dewey Cocks\u0027s manager (a gigantic black man called in the script, hilariously, WHITEY) intercedes with this line of dialogue: \u0022Dewey Cocks don\u0027t go on the stage until he recalls all the girls he has had sex with in his lifetime.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m going to try going back chronologically,\u0022 Deen tells the crew from his position on the wall. After one of many takes, Deen relays the total: \u0022I got back, like, two weeks! I don\u0027t know if I can go farther.\u0022 \u000A\u000AWith the framing device in place, Deen spends most of the day\u0027s remainder in plural intercourse with one Tiffany Brookes and one Jessica Jaymes, who are portraying his groupies. Miss Jaymes is a ten-year vet whose huge blister-pack protrusions are somewhat at odds with her springbok svelteness. It would be a mischaracterization to say that she is a supernova of youthful enthusiasm about the project at hand. Today\u0027s shoot, as she puts it, \u0022ain\u0027t my first fuckin\u0027 rodeo, bra\u0027.\u0022 When she meets Deen, clad in the foul wig and tights, her response is (to Deen\u0027s unarticulated pique) \u0022I gotta fuck you in that? Do you have to fuck in that thing [meaning the wig] the whole time?\u0022\u000A\u000ADeen allows that he does.\u000A\u000A\u0022And I have to pretend I like it? Oh, give it to me, hairy daddy,\u0022 Miss Jaymes says with a dry laugh.\u000A\u000AOkay, action! From the start, the offscreen chemistry is poor. When the camera stops rolling, all intimacy ceases. Miss Jaymes and Miss Brookes are old friends and act like a pair of collegial waitresses who have worked at the same cheap diner for many unwondrous years. Between takes they carp lightheartedly at each other for dragging ass on the shift. \u000A\u000A\u0022You didn\u0027t suck as much dick as I did.\u0022 \u000A\u000A\u0022You gonna help me out with this thing?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022God, I want to brush my teeth.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m eating fucking bad wig hair.\u0022\u000A\u000ADeen apologizes. \u0022It came from a bag.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022So did I,\u0022 replies Miss Jaymes.\u000A\u000ADeen eventually gets a little peevish. Miss Jaymes, in particular, attends to him so minimally that, in a subtle huff, Deen quits the scene to wring himself back to full rigor. \u000A\u000AWhen the sex ends, Deen is permitted to trash the hotel room. He sets about the destruction so ardently—tearing wainscoting, shattering the television—that one guesses the expression of frustration is partly genuine. On the drive back to our hotel, Deen confirms his discontent with the shoot.\u000A\u000A\u0022I mean, the first thing [Jessica Jaymes] said to me was, ‘Oh, my God, I have to fuck you?\u0027 You could say that in a nicer way. ‘Your outfit is really silly looking. Oh, my God, I can\u0027t believe they\u0027re making you wear that—that\u0027s hilarious....\u0027 It\u0027s just that she wanted to make it clear that ‘we are working. This is a job, and I will not sexually enjoy myself.\u0027 She basically wanted to do the least amount of sex as humanly possible.... But it\u0027s fine. The product\u0027ll turn out good. On-camera it\u0027ll look like everybody had a great time.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AThat night Deen holes up for fourteen hours. Midday finds him chipper and not the least bit down in the mouth about having to schlep to yet another loaner mansion to mate on-camera with yet another couple of women. \u000A\u000AToday, Deen will be playing the pornographic actor and teen idol James Deen in a word-for-word send-up of the scaremongering Nightline spot about Deen\u0027s popularity with the teen set. Deen, for his part, has mid feelings about the piece. Anchor Terry Moran, whose sneering opinings bracketed the story, is, according to Deen, \u0022just a dick.... Fuck that guy.\u0022 Yet he concedes, \u0022They could have made me look bad, between all my ramblings and the dumb shit that I say, and they didn\u0027t.\u0022\u000A\u000APlaying the part of ABC\u0027s Cecilia Vega is a teeteringly thin Portuguese woman named Erica, whose immaculate blondeness and avian features lend her a passing resemblance to Callista Gingrich. \u000A\u000AAnd \u0022Quiet—rolling!\u0022 Deen sits on a counter stool while Erica tries with tongue-twisting effort to recite hardballs from the Nightline interview, e.g., \u0022So you have massive female following young womans. What you say to that?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022If these women are looking for pornographic material on the Internet, they\u0027re obviously into sex,\u0022 says Deen. \u0022They like sex. They want to explore their sexuality, which isn\u0027t necessarily a bad thing.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Their parents meat,\u0022 says Erica. \u0022What is meat?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Might,\u0022 says the director, a huskily built thirtysomething Latino guy named Huggy. \u0022Their parents might not think so.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Their parents meat...\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Their parents may disagree,\u0022 offers Huggy.\u000A\u000AAction.\u000A\u000A\u0022Their parents may disagree.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022We have a girl here? Claims is your biggest fan?\u0022 says Erica. \u0022James Deen, meet your biggest fan, Lazy Tailor?\u0022\u000A\u000AA nut brown young actress named Lizz Tayler scampers in. \u0022Oh, my God, oh, my God. Is it really you? Can I see your cock?\u0022 Why certainly. \u000A\u000A\u0022Will you fuck me like a porn star?\u0022 \u000A\u000AAfter the foregoing days, any normal man would view the prospect of more tungsten-lit sex with strangers the way you might view a sixty-ounce steak after a hot-dog-eating contest. But we are beginning to learn that Deen, despite his bankable Everyman persona, is by no means a normal man. He alights from the stool with a grin.\u000A\u000ASo what happens next? Oh, some oralness, some conjugal tusslings, some other things, dear reader, that after a week mooching around on pornography sets I no longer find astonishing enough to set down in print. The soul is weary. The pen is weary. I am a little abashed, a little ashamed, for having described so much in the preceding paragraphs, to have made myself your Vic Lagina, your Robby D., your personal pornographer. \u000A\u000AAt this point, in answer to the query I posed at the start of our voyage, I can sincerely say that I would rather drink a mugful of live ticks than switch places with James Deen.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re shittin\u0027 me! you say. Why? Well, not only because being impelled to couple every day with a stranger before a room of onlookers seems like an experiment dreamed up by Martian scientists. And not only because the Groundhog Day-ish sameness would, I think, accumulate to a monotony akin to a career in oyster shucking. Ultimately, for this reporter, I would be frightened that if I weren\u0027t able to recall the names of sexual partners beyond the previous two weeks, ideals like intimacy and love would begin to seem gooey and absurd, and a terrible unexamined loneliness would become the natural condition of my life. I do not voice this sentiment to Deen. It would offend him. It would come across as prudishly un-\u0022sex-positive\u0022 and critical of Deen and the industry he holds dear. \u000A\u000ABut he would be missing the point. What I am saying is that we may well owe a debt of gratitude to James Deen. That just as Superman makes plain why the rest of us should not jump off buildings, the extraordinary Deen and his Kryptonian psychosexual constitution illustrate why the ordinary man should not try to peg everything with opposable thumbs. All day, every day, James Deen is fucking the planet senseless so that the rest of us don\u0027t have to try to. Indeed, when the confines of monogamy begin to feel drab and claustrophobic, Deen and his adventures are just a track pad away. By the time your wife gets back from the store, you, feeling a little shabby, a little guilty, will be so glad to see her that you will never want to look upon another naked woman for at least ninety minutes or so. (Incidentally, you have the permission of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which lately disclosed that in our age of rampant web-based autoeroticism, divorce has in fact declined over the past fifteen years.)\u000A\u000ABut for now, I will speak no more of meaningless balling. From here on out, I will speak only of feelings and human connectedness. \u000A\u000AOkay, then. So. How is James Deen feeling? How is his human connectedness? I am happy to report that James Deen is feeling good, because even now, in a candid moment when the cameras are not rolling and no one is professionally obliged to have sex with him, he is lying on a black leather sectional, actively connected to Lizz Tayler in the spoon position, and he is also connected to Miss Erica, whose cooter he is jabbing with a nimble big toe. Today so much feeling, so much connectedness, abounds on the set that even after Deen\u0027s orgasm has been videoed for perpetuity, he loiters on the sofa with Miss Erica, who is grasping Deen\u0027s ficelle between the arches of her feet and laughing in a musical way. \u000A\u000A\u0022You like me, don\u0027t you?\u0022 Deen asks her.\u000A\u000AShe nods and chirps.\u000A\u000A\u0022Good day,\u0022 says Deen. \u0022Really good day.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AAnd then, after a long, arduous, and ordinary sort of week, it is time for James Deen to shower up, climb into his Ford F-150 Raptor, and head west through the desert to the horizon of his homing. He has a shoot in Los Angeles tomorrow morning, yet the drive is a mere four hours and will put him back in time to spend an evening away from pornography. Rolling through Barstow, he places a call to some old pals in Pasadena, civilians, friends from his life before. Are they up for a visit this evening? Yes, they are, but there is an issue. Even among his trusted cronies, Deen\u0027s screen persona dogs him. A friend\u0027s sister is part of the hangout crew tonight, and the friend is rightly concerned that Deen will take the sister to bed.\u000A\u000A\u0022Look, I\u0027m not gonna try to fuck your sister,\u0022 Deen says assuringly. There is some dubious squawking from the other party. \u0022I promise, I\u0027m not gonna try to fuck your sister.\u0022 It is not enough. \u0022Look, I\u0027m not gonna try to fuck your sister!\u0022Exasperation gets the better of him. At last James Deen must speak the truth:\u000A\u000A\u0022I mean, I\u0027m going to fuck your sister, but I\u0027m not going to try.\u0022",

Not really. They&#39;re extras. They&#39;re props. They&#39;re stand-ins for guys everywhere. But not Mr. James Deen. Just by being, well, average (or let&#39;s say larger than average), Deen has gotten huge (oops). And what&#39;s even stranger is who he&#39;s gotten huge with (hey, we didn&#39;t mean that): women, young women, and even teenage girls. Wells Tower spends a week with the man who would apparently have the best job in the world. (He doesn&#39;t)</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.0">It is a clement&#xA0;spring day in greater Los Angeles, and James Deen is driving through the soft green tumescences of the&#xA0;Calabasas hills on his way to a pornographic-movie shoot. If Deen betrays not a trace of anticipation, aversion, or excitement at the prospect of having sex on-camera today, it is because having sex on-camera is something the 26-year-old does more frequently than most of us use dental floss: &quot;About 360 days a year&quot; is Deen&apos;s offhand tally.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1">Deen&apos;s professional relentlessness has yielded a host of accolades. In 2009, when he was 23, the Adult Video News (AVN) Awards, pornography&apos;s Oscars, named Deen &quot;Male Performer of the Year.&quot; (Deen was one of the youngest actors ever to be so decorated.) This on the heels of a similar distinction from the X-Rated Critics Organization, which in 2007 noted the arrival of a major talent with an &quot;Unsung Swordsman&quot; award.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2">Industry plaudits aside, Deen has managed an order of renown far rarer in the world of pornographic film: He is a male performer people actually know by name. According to Deen, 10,000 unique visitors peruse his blog every day. Women seem to like him. A recent&#xA0;<em>Nightline</em> segment alerted parents to Deen&apos;s crossover appeal among teenage girls, who, the piece warned, hold for Deen a place in their hearts alongside Timberlake and Bieber. (Anchor Terry Moran: &quot;For any parent concerned about what their teen does online, the huge popularity of the young man you are about to meet may be deeply disturbing.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3">A visit to the comments section of Deen&apos;s website appears to confirm&#xA0;<em>Nightline&apos;</em>s claims:</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.5">&quot;Hey James :) I&apos;m 16 years old and i love your work&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.6">&quot;hey (; have you EVER banged a teen latina ? e-mail me....&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.7">&quot;i would totally rock your world...mind you im 16 about to be 17.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.8">Deen brakes his truck at the bottom of a steep gated driveway,<strong> </strong>which leads to a sprawling mansion that looks made of nougat. Its dominant interior materials are faux gilt, beveled glass, and plastic flora. The game room, which is as big as my house, contains dartboards, a pool table, and a saloon area with a neon sign reading&#xA0;ICE CREAM&#xA0;fid above the mirrored back bar. The house&apos;s real-life owner, one supposes, is a fabulously well-to-do 14-year-old.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.9">But today the mansion&apos;s fictive owner is James Deen himself, who has been cast in the role of a priapic millionaire with a gambling problem. The shoot is for a company called Digital Playground, which claims to specialize in &quot;high-end&quot; pornography for couples&#x2014;&quot;vanilla porn,&quot; as hard-raunch aficionados dub DP&apos;s output.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.a">&quot;As far as making visually stimulating erotic cinema, Digital Playground&apos;s pretty much the best,&quot; says Deen. &quot;Personally, I hate it. It&apos;s too pretty. When I&apos;m watching adult, I don&apos;t care about the lighting. I want to see dirty, nasty: Rocco Siffredi&quot;&#x2014;an Italian porn star known for full-contact choreographies in which he dragoons pretty ladies into tonguing his caboose.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.b">Over the next seven days, Deen will exercise his full array of talents and preferences on seven projects in three cities&#x2014;Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. I will be riding shotgun in Deen&apos;s utterly bitching pumpkin orange off-road-package Ford F-150 Raptor, watching him work, and trying to make sense of his extraordinary life.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.c">I have many questions:</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.d">First off, brooking so much unremitting daily friction, how has James Deen&apos;s penis not been stropped to raw liver? &quot;I don&apos;t know. I guess I&apos;ve got pretty thick skin.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.e">How does he keep his houseplants alive with so much travel? He doesn&apos;t. All the plants in Deen&apos;s 4,200-square-foot home in the San Fernando Valley have died.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.f">Gosh, but mustn&apos;t Deen have an astonishing collection of venereal diseases? He and his colleagues undergo testing every month. Deen claims, incredibly, to never have had a test come back &quot;dirty.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.g">Does he gobble Viagra like popcorn? Certainly not. His erections are 100 percent organic and pharma-free.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.h">A good portion of Deen&apos;s oeuvre consists of rather not-nice stuff: spitting, whipping, choking, slapping, etc. Is there anything he won&apos;t do on-camera? He will not have sex with someone who is unwilling to have sex with him. He will not have sex with men. He will not dress as a clown and have sex with someone; nor will he permit someone dressed as a clown to have sex with him. Clowns make James Deen uncomfortable.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.i">Isn&apos;t this sort of career exhausting physically, spiritually? Doesn&apos;t he sometimes wish he&apos;d picked another calling? No indeed. He loves his work. He&apos;d do it even if he weren&apos;t getting paid: &quot;My life is pretty awesome.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.j">Lastly, a silent query to the nation&apos;s gentlemen, we who have spent many otherwise productive hours pondering what it would be like to be able to bed an infinite rotating population of beautiful women: If given the chance, would we live Deen&apos;s dream? For a day? For a week? Yes? We shall see.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.k">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.l">Losing Kayden is the working title of today&apos;s film. Its centerpiece is an actress by the name of Kayden Kross, a wholly winning and improbably bookish young woman who reads the short fiction of David Foster Wallace between takes. The crew is far more substantial, congenial, and pro-seeming than one expected. There&apos;s no more ambient prurience than you&apos;d find at an ad shoot for Windex.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.m">A little after dusk, Deen is summoned to his first scene, a non-nude narrative load bearer in which he loses his mansion in a poker game with a gangster. Handling the role of the crime boss is a creepy German actor in his middle years named Steve Holmes, now parked at the card table. He wears a pair of granddad-ish EZ-reader glasses and below them a seedy mustache-and-goatee combo, and far below that a pair of dark trousers from whose open fly depends something like a turkey&apos;s wattle.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.n">The third factor in the scene is a blonde 19-year-old named Allie James. Earlier, when I asked Allie James what she&apos;d be up to today, she replied, &quot;I&apos;ll be crawling around under a table sucking cock.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.o">Allie joined the industry six months&#xA0;ago after fleeing the family farm in upstate New York. With the exception of Steve Holmes, she&apos;s the only person on the set who flaunts her zeal for the erotic when the camera is not rolling. She roams the mansion with her shirt hiked up over her breasts. While the other scenes were being shot, neither Deen nor any of the other talent were the least bit interested in watching the action, but Allie liked to perch on the sidelines, insouciantly masturbating and checking her Facebook page and also chewing the heck out of some gum.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.p">While the crew is dragging lighting rigs and attending to last-minute particulars, James takes a seat at the poker table with Allie and Steve. Allie perches on Steve&apos;s engorged lap. Steve gets an idea: Wouldn&apos;t it&#xA0;be diverting if Allie James were to pose for a photograph with Steve&apos;s penis in her mouth, which Steve could text to Allie&apos;s mother?&#xA0;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.q"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c6ace52bc4b477a9d287/master/w_600/entertainment-2012-07-james-deen-james-deen-inset.jpg" alt="entertainment-2012-07-james-deen-james-deen-inset.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjames-deen-porn-star-gq-june-2012-interview&amp;t=entertainment-2012-07-james-deen-james-deen-inset.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjames-deen-porn-star-gq-june-2012-interview&amp;t=entertainment-2012-07-james-deen-james-deen-inset.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjames-deen-porn-star-gq-june-2012-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c6ace52bc4b477a9d287%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2012-07-james-deen-james-deen-inset.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2012-07-james-deen-james-deen-inset.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjames-deen-porn-star-gq-june-2012-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c6ace52bc4b477a9d287%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2012-07-james-deen-james-deen-inset.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2012-07-james-deen-james-deen-inset.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.r"> __</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.s">She kneels. He snaps. &quot;He&apos;s gonna send it to my mom!&quot; Allie cries with apparent delight.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.t">&quot;I want to fuck them both,&quot; Steve Holmes explains, punching Allie&apos;s mother&apos;s number into his phone.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.u">With minutes to go until go time, the cast talks shop. In response to a conversation starter I do not catch, Allie relates a childhood memory, the gist of which is that when she was 9 years old, hanging out with her brothers, she was encouraged to perform sexual acts for their friends in exchange for marijuana.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.v">Now Deen looks up from his telephone for the first time in quite a while.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.w">&quot;And you were cool with it?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.x">&quot;Oh, <em>yeah,&quot; </em>says Allie James.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.y">Deen hoists his eyebrows. &quot;As long as you were cool with it,&quot; he says.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.z">&quot;Okay, okay, let&apos;s focus!&quot; booms the director, Robby D., an imposing, fearsomely bald man. The time for horseplay is at an end. It is time for acting now. &quot;So on &#x2018;Action,&apos;you guys are playing poker&#x2014;and you,&quot; he says to Allie, &quot;you start sucking his dingy.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.10"><em>Click</em> goes the little scene-marker guillotine, the &quot;sticks.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.11">The scene takes halting shape after Deen brooks a surprisingly rigorous Stanislavsky-ing from Robby D. (&quot;Try to find the character. He&apos;s a gambling addict. Nervous, edgy. Take your time. Check out the blow job.&quot;) Meanwhile, over by the ice cream bar, the crew reviews the tape and sniggers. Allie&apos;s blow job is deemed &quot;horrible,&quot; for, as far as I can follow the logic, a dearth of audible gagging sounds. But anyway, it&apos;s not an important blow job&#x2014;just some ornamental side action to mitigate the scene&apos;s dull plot load. The scene is a keeper.&#xA0;So while the crew sets up the next shot, Allie James fetches some paper towels and sponges up the squalid whey that has pooled about her knees.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.12">Several hours later, after midnight, Deen is finally summoned to perform. His scene is in an upstairs bedroom with Kayden Kross, who really does look lovely in her pink top and purple bra. Deen and Kross are old friends. Deen was not her first scene, but he was her third some years ago. On the heels of Allie James&apos;s unheartwarming ministrations, James and Kayden seem sweet, natural, and eager to hump for reasons having to do with actual interpersonal fondness.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.13">They run through a bit of dialogue concerning James&apos;s gambling problem and then collide. James disrobes&#xA0;<em>in medias.</em> Nude, he looks even tinier than his elfin five feet eight. His body is about like an eighth grader&apos;s. His penis is smaller than a baguette.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.14">&quot;You been working out?&quot; Robby asks between takes.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.15">&quot;No,&quot; says James.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.16">&quot;I didn&apos;t think so.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.17">It&apos;s true&#x2014;no rippling sinews are visible on James Deen&apos;s body. There are probably 12-year-old girls who could take him in a fight. And this, Deen tells me, is partly the secret of his success. He is not the traditional&#xA0;porno man, no overbulked squat-thruster spray-broasted from the Darque Tan booth. He is sort of wimpy-looking. With luminous blue eyes and well-structured, stubble-flocked cheekbones, he is handsome, but in an everyday, non-Hollywood way. &quot;Not horrible to look at&quot; is how Deen describes his appearance. &quot;I&apos;m like a guy a chick might actually meet in a bar.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.18">That Deen&apos;s very ordinariness is somehow a virtue in the industry is, one could argue, a symptom of pornography&apos;s journey from unsanitary movie theaters and paper-windowed bookstores to every computer screen the free world over. A theory: Back in the days when the culture could pretend that porn was being exclusively consumed by sex criminals and raincoaters, viewing pornography was actually a multilayered form of voyeurship. The chief thrill was, of course, watching people screw, but salting that thrill was a Lovelace-ian paratext of unhappiness, addiction, disease, etc. The fact that the performers were doomed and loathed, if hypocritically, by mainstream culture made them more exciting to watch. That female performers should be made to couple with satanic reptiles like John Holmes or Ron Jeremy was just, fitting, gross, and perversely harmonious with the moral aesthetic of the age.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.19">In the 1980s and &apos;90s, the grodiness of the male talent migrated somewhat, from Holmes-style Swamp Things to steroidal Fabioids. But still, the pornographic fantasy seemed to be happening among people not&#xA0;exactly of our species, on a planet where nude&#xA0;women languish in wait for pizza men who look like courtiers from Castle Grayskull.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1a">So enter the present age, when almost everyone is watching porn (two in five U.S. Internet users&#x2014;125 million&#x2014;visit an adult site each month), when American porn sites reportedly receive 28,000 unique hits&#xA0;<em>every second,&#xA0;</em>when the AVN estimates that a third of consistent porn viewers are women. Now that pretty much every man (if not woman and child) is watching porn, there is at last demand for a pornographic Everyman in the form of James Deen, whose regular dudeness acknowledges that his world is our world and our world is Planet Porn.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1b">Anyway, sorry for talking while you&apos;re trying to concentrate. Back at it: Deen does away with Miss Kross&apos;s panties. She spread-eagles on the edge of the bed, and Deen commences a kalimba move on her vulva. Then comes what I soon recognize as Deen&apos;s default prelude: a deft bit of multitasking in which he launches into a cunnilinctory overture with his legs in a sprinter-at-the-blocks posture. This affords him latitude to hand-crank himself rigid below the camera frame. Small and swart, snacking avidly on Miss Kross, Deen vaguely favors the incubus in Fuseli&apos;s&#xA0;<em>The Nightmare.&#xA0;&#xA0;</em></p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1c">After a brief interval of manual pump priming, he breaks off the oral business, which now, in its frantic lateralness, has begun to resemble an impassioned harmonica solo. The derricking begins. Kayden Kross is posed in a swastika of shapely limbs. He toils, leans his face into hers, and the two murmur to each other in a guttural lock-jawed patois intelligible to no one but themselves. Every now and then, the two of them break into heliated laughter, as though to say, &quot;All of this grunting and grasping and fuck-me fuck-me porno jabber is a bit absurd, isn&apos;t it? But jeepers, chum, it really is awfully nice to be having sex with you.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1d">&quot;I wish&#xA0;<em>I </em>got to stick my dick in some chick&apos;s fuckin&apos; pussy,&quot; one of the crew members reflects bitterly. This attitude is perhaps shared by readers at home. But it soon becomes clear why neither the cameraman nor you nor I will ever get to have our trousers off near Miss Kross.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1e">After several frictive minutes, the action stops. The still photographer comes in and for fifteen minutes or so arranges James and Kayden into assorted tableaux, and all the while James&apos;s gizmo stands as steadfast as the Chrysler Building. Then the action resumes, only this time it&apos;s for a soft-core version (inside factoid: The blue movies you see on late-night cable? The actors are actually having sex), followed by another ten minutes or so of intimate strife and moanery, before they at last go back to the full and flagrant penetrative churn. Finally Robby calls, &quot;Okay, let&apos;s bring it home. BJ, then pop.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1f">Within a few fleeting moments, presto: Deen is punctually drizzling genetic material onto Kayden&apos;s adorable face.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1g">And cut. &quot;I got come up my nose and my eyeball,&quot; Kayden says in a tone not of displeasure. &quot;It was so good. I love James.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1h">And James? Would he work with her again, someone asks.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1i">&quot;Fuck no,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1j">Kayden snorts in mock umbrage. &quot;I&apos;ll rape you if you don&apos;t.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1k">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1l">At 2:30 a.m.,&#xA0;<em>Losing Kayden</em> is pronounced a wrap. The crew coils cable. While the cast goes home, Deen heads to his ginormous pickup truck and sets a course for San Francisco, where he is needed on set twelve hours from now. A journalist in the passenger&apos;s seat, having spectated on live sex acts for the first time in his life, about a dozen solid hours&apos; worth, is suffering not wholly agreeable reelings of the mind that he tries to cover for with ninnyish small talk.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1m">&quot;So that scene with Kayden seemed, ah, pretty enjoyable.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1n">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Deen says. &quot;I always say sex is like soccer: It&apos;s fun and athletic, and you should do it with your friends.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1o">Yes, I think. Right. Certainly. Here is a simple statement that Deen means pretty much as it sounds, but it also pithily expresses yet another reason why you or I will never be the sort of soccer player James Deen is. It&apos;s not just that he&apos;s got bigger, you know, feet than we do. It&apos;s that for you, on that night of enduring awkwardness when you went out for drinks with the woman in the adjacent cubicle and achieved your long-cherished fantasy of playing soccer with her, you did so not because you thought she was going to be this tremendously good soccer player. It was that you were thrilled that she found you sufficiently nonrevolting that she was willing to get on the field with you, which was a big consideration, because as you both knew, what makes the game so very, very exciting isn&apos;t its competitive physics but the conceit that the game is actually a high-velocity delivery system for privileged emotional knowledge of the other player&apos;s secret self. And that even if you&apos;re the sort of freebooting venereal Olympian who tries to play soccer with absolutely everything that moves, your compulsion to play is still ultimately grounded in the marrow-level conviction that the game matters in some way a good deal more complex and high-stakes than simple athletic fun.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1p">But the remarkable thing about Deen is, I think, that he has managed to dissociate sex from emotional consequence,<strong> </strong>a feat of psychosexual contortionism he was limbering up for at an age when the rest of us had yet to tie our own shoelaces.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1q"><strong>Q:</strong> So when did you decide to do porn?</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1r"><strong>A:</strong> Kindergarten. I remember I was walking home one day, and I found this magazine, I don&apos;t know, a&#xA0;<em>Hustler </em>or something, with people banging in it. I was enamored by it. I was like, I want to do this. I actually got in trouble in third or fourth grade. They were asking everybody what they wanted to be when they grew up, and I said I wanted to be a porn star. They didn&apos;t like that. They thought I was being a dick. I was like, &quot;I&apos;m not being a dick, it&apos;s just what I want to be.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1s">But outside of porn, before he entered the industry, what else interested him? &quot;Nothing. That&apos;s the thing. My whole life, I&apos;ve never really found anything else that I&apos;ve found interesting.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1t">James Deen, whose real name is Bryan Sevilla, grew up in Pasadena, California. His parents are both, after a fashion, rocket scientists. His father is a mechanical engineer for NASA. His mother does data analysis for the space agency. Deen, contrary to our notion of porn stars as survivors of sexual trauma, does not recall any sexual abuse or destructive misadventures, other than a teacher who Deen says tried to molest him when he was 8 or 9, but Deen &quot;punched his testicles a lot&quot; and made good his escape.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1u">Deen lost his virginity at age 12 during a sleepover at a Jewish camp. Not long after, in junior high school, he made enemies of the football team by having sex with a player&apos;s sister in the school pool during gym. He had some drug escapades in junior high. He spent a couple of years in outpatient rehab. Around age 15, he left high school and moved out and spent two years more or less homeless, hanging around with a crew of gutter punks. Relations with his parents remained reasonably cordial. They furnished him with a cell phone, and he periodically snuck into his mom&apos;s house to do laundry. (Deen&apos;s parents are divorced.)</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1v">At around 17, he moved in with his father. He was working at a Starbucks and taking classes at a community college when one evening he says he chanced upon a call-in radio program whose guest was the porn star Jenna Jameson. She imparted what was, for Deen, life-altering advice.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1w">&quot;So some guy calls in for like the millionth time and says, &#x2018;I wanna do porn. How do I get into the industry?&apos; And she&apos;s been listening to this shit all night. She&apos;s frustrated. She goes, &#x2018;You wanna do porn? Go get a folding chair and sit in a room with twenty people and jerk off for an hour. And if you can keep hard, and when one of them yells &quot;Come!&quot; you can come in thirty seconds, then you can do porn.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1x">Deen hearkened to these words. He began a self-styled apprenticeship in not-for-profit guerrilla pornography. &quot;I started going to parties, and I&apos;d bang girls in front of groups of people,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I learned I could come on cue. I was told to come, and I&apos;d come. I don&apos;t know how I do it. It has something to do with muscle control. It&apos;s easy for me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1y">In 2004 a stripper Deen knew introduced him to a casting agent who posted his naked picture on the World Wide Web. In short order, Deen was offered a role to be the recipient of something &quot;more than a hand job but less than a blow job.&quot; He acquitted himself creditably. His career had begun. His agent thought &quot;Clint Cunnilingus&quot; was a poor choice of screen name. Bryan Sevilla instead became James Deen, inspired by the nickname he won in junior high school for the soign&#xE9; manner in which he liked to pinch-cup a cigarette.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.1z"> In due time, a director offered the young aspirant his first full scene. The wood was durable, the orgasm prompt. Deen had proved himself a fellow of Miss Jameson&apos;s calling. Jobs poured in. (Deen wouldn&apos;t disclose his earnings, but top male talent can command $800 to $1,000 a scene.)&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.20">Though you could not hire a lobbyist to boost for the porn industry more enthusiastically than James Deen, he does acknowledge that the life has its pitfalls. On our ride north, I mention what will be, for me, the least forgettable or pleasant image of the week I spend with him: that of Allie James posed with Steve Holmes&apos;s organ in a photo for her mother.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.21">&quot;Yeah, obviously she&apos;s damaged. I&apos;m, like, getting pimped out when you were 9 so your brothers could smoke weed? That&apos;s not healthy. She&apos;s like Rick Santorum&apos;s wet dream, the poster child for how people in porn are damaged,&quot; Deen says. &quot;But for every person like her, there&apos;s someone like, I&apos;d like to say, me. I had a great childhood. My parents and I get along. I just like sex, and I like porn, and I think it&apos;s fun. I&apos;m always terrified that someday I&apos;m going to come to the realization that I&apos;ve got some deep, dark secret, some terrifying, horrible experience where I&apos;m going to be like, &#x2018;I&apos;m actually&#xA0;<em>not normal.</em> I&apos;m a crazy person!&apos; But it just doesn&apos;t seem to be the case.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.22">The Santorum poster children are, as Deen has it, performers who &quot;lose their real persona and become their porn persona, this party person who is obsessed with sex, who is constantly taking their clothes off.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.23">I suggest to Deen that perhaps the reason Bryan Sevilla hasn&apos;t manifested persona slip when he became James Deen is that Sevilla&#x2014;the kindergarten porn enthusiast, preteen industry aspirant, the public coupler at social functions&#x2014;has&#xA0;<em>always </em>been James Deen.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.24">&quot;I&apos;d agree with that,&quot; he says.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.25">And on we roll, north on I-5, yours truly dozing off while Deen blares on his superb sound system, at 3,000 dBs, his favorite tune: &quot;Yes&quot; by LMFAO, whose refrain runs, <em>Every day I see my dream.</em></p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.26">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.27">James Deen&#xA0;arrives in San Francisco with the morning traffic. His destination is the Mission District headquarters of the sex conglomerate Kink.com. If Digital Playground is vanilla, Kink.com is decidedly rocky road. Kink&apos;s family of websites includes but is not limited to Hogtied.com, BoundGangBangs.com, ButtMachineBoys.com, BoundInPublic.com, PublicDisgrace.com, NakedKombat.com, WiredPussy.com, and ElectroSluts.com.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.28">According to Deen, Kink is among the most profitable companies in the porn industry, owing to its extraordinarily loyal consumer base of fetishists. A fetish, Deen explains, is not a mere preference or lark but a controlling obsession. A fetishist cannot enjoy himself sexually unless he is observing, for example, someone&apos;s vagina getting jazzed with 110 volts of house current. &quot;The people who watch it don&apos;t watch because they want to, they watch it because they&#xA0;<em>need </em>to,&quot; Deen says.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.29">Content for Kink&apos;s assorted websites is mostly filmed on location at a former National Guard armory, a forbidding Moorish Revival fortress at 14th and Mission that Kink purchased in 2006 for $14.5 million. Today, Deen will be filming a scene in the armory&apos;s basement for EverythingButt.com. &quot;It&apos;s about butts,&quot; Deen explains. &quot;It&apos;s normally girl-girl. The girls play with each other, insert various objects into each other&apos;s rectums, and then I show up and bang them in their butts and call it a day. It&apos;s not one of my favorites, because there&apos;s not much actual sex.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2a">For all of Kink&apos;s outr&#xE9; offerings, the armory actually feels a good deal less porny than the glitzy loaner mansion we were in last night. More Williamsburg than San Fernando Valley. People we pass in the hallways look like bike messengers, librarians, and assistant faculty in women&apos;s-studies departments.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2b">The armory contains an uncountable number of studios made to simulate bars and dungeons and karate dojos. Deen makes his way to the basement. He cocks an ear to a studio door where the scene he&apos;ll be joining is already steaming along. Through the plywood, we can hear a woman voicing hysterical testimony as to the condition and surrendered proprietorship of her tuchus. &quot;Whose ass is it?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2c">&quot;It&apos;s your ass.... My ass is yours!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2d">Deen and I&#x2014;haggard, malarial with sleep deprivation&#x2014;doze nearby on a pair of sofas without a care for the deeds that have surely soiled the upholstery.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2e">Within the hour, Deen is summoned to the set, which is a genuine industrial-age boiler room. It contains an actual boiler, a steel-frame single bed suggestive of an old-timey insane asylum, an equipment table bearing whips, a lengthy, diametrically graduated recto-probe, dildos, and an alligator&apos;s head. Personnel includes the director&#x2014;a mild, soft-spoken man with fine Teutonic features&#x2014;and a cameraman in a full jumpsuit as per OSHA regulations. There is also Isis Love, administrator of the anatomical stresses we were overhearing during our nap. Isis is a tawny Amazon with black sheeny hair and a black corsetish thing tailored to expose breasts like a pair of headlocked toddlers. The scene&apos;s operational subject is a young woman named Proxy Paige, a slightly mousy hipster type. Fishnets and silver bustier notwithstanding, she looks like a civilian. I&apos;m worried about her.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2f">Pregame particulars are attended to. Deen conducts a brief interview with Proxy Paige as to her personal boundaries. Proxy says she lately had some wisdom-tooth trouble on one side of her jaw and would prefer not to be slapped there. Anything else is cool. Then Deen, by way of small talk, recounts yesterday&apos;s Steve-Holmes-texting-the-fellatio-photo-to-Allie-James&apos;s-mother anecdote, to which Proxy Paige replies that she would like &quot;to fuck [Steve] and his son so bad it makes me uncomfortable,&quot; which assures me that whatever further abuse the afternoon holds for Proxy Paige, she can hack it just fine.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2g">Lights, camera&#x2014;before filming begins, the scene founders. Deen is rigid and all, but syntactical confusion halts the choreography. &quot;When you come in,&quot; Isis says to Deen, &quot;I&apos;ll be licking her ass, getting her ass all wet so you can fuck her while she&apos;s sucking your cock.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2h">Deen looks at Isis Love like,&#xA0;<em>Say what?&#xA0;</em>&quot;I don&apos;t know how big you think my cock is,&quot; Deen says. &quot;I don&apos;t know how I can fuck her&#xA0;<em>while </em>she&apos;s sucking my cock. It won&apos;t, like, go&#xA0;<em>through </em>her.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2i">&quot;No, no,&quot; says Isis Love. &quot;I&apos;ll be licking her ass and getting her ass all spitty so you can fuck her while she&apos;s sucking your cock.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2j"><em>Pardon?</em></p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2k">After some back-and-forth, Deen roots out the source of the perplexity, a misplaced&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2l"> temporal clause, &quot;Oh, you&apos;re going to lick her ass [preparatory to coitus]&#xA0;<em>while</em> she&apos;s sucking my cock.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2m">Yes, yes, that&apos;s it precisely.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2n">Action: The scene begins with Proxy kneeling on the floor and fellating. Isis and Deen stand on either side of her such that Isis, by humping the back of Proxy&apos;s head, compels Proxy to repeatedly spindle her gullet on Deen&apos;s person. That goes on for a while, and then Deen, wang still endentured, sort of drags Proxy over to the bed in a maneuver reminiscent of what we used to refer to in junior high school as a &quot;bulldog.&quot; Isis Love stands close at hand, emitting a faultfinding commentary of ungentle encouragement, &quot;Keep it in your mouth, slut,&quot; etc., etc.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2o">Um, hey. You out there, do you seriously want me to keep describing this stuff? Really? Because it gets a lot worse from here. All right, you asked for it.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2p">&quot;Okay!&quot; says Isis Love. &quot;Time for the human centipede.&quot; The &quot;human centipede&quot; = Deen sodomizing Proxy Paige while Proxy Paige&#xA0;buries her face between the russet buttocks of Isis Love in a snuffling pantomime of a &quot;Kilroy&#xA0;was here&quot; graffito. Isis at regular intervals hocks lubricative loogies into the pistonworks going full-bore at the base of Proxy&apos;s spine. Every now and again Isis disengages Deen&apos;s cruller so that the camera can get a load of Proxy&apos;s keister, which footage you should track&#xA0;down if you happen to adore the sight of a yawning, defanged lamprey with strep throat.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2q">From there, in flagrant contravention of the USDA&apos;s Safe Food Handling Fact Sheet, Deen plunges his unwashed tuber straightaway into Proxy&apos;s mouth. A set of chain-linked nipple clamps are attached to poor Proxy. Deen yanks roguishly on the chain while Isis covers Proxy&apos;s nose and mouth, depriving her of oxygen. While Deen pays a return visit to Proxy&apos;s service entrance, Isis Love manages to slip a searching finger or two in there as well.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2r">At this point, an unlearned onlooker might adjudge Proxy&apos;s hindmost to be quite adequately crammed, perhaps even crammed to excess. But Deen, whose right hand is stuffed into Proxy&apos;s mouth noodlin&apos;-for-flatheads-style, manages to wedge a few additional digits into Proxy&apos;s exhaust port.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2s">&quot;You are so fucking sick and evil and twisted and fucked-up,&quot; Isis says to Deen. &quot;I fucking love you.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2t">Proxy&apos;s breathing is stertorous, rapid, pre-infarctatory. Between takes she&apos;s asked if she&apos;s okay. She nods. Her eyes leak little tears, which Deen wipes away with the quick strokes of an experienced cut man. Before long, Deen is instructed to ejaculate, which he does, with dispatch, on Proxy&apos;s face.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2u">And cut! We&apos;re clear! Thank heavens.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2v">Deen flees the set in search of a shower. Isis and Proxy sit abed for a postgame interview.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2w"><strong>Isis Love:</strong> Proxy, how you feeling right now?</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2x"><strong>Proxy Paige:</strong> <em>[panting]</em> Good! Worked over.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2y"><strong>Isis:</strong> Was it everything you expected it to be?</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.2z"><strong>Proxy:</strong> Yes, and I got to do a lot of things I hadn&apos;t done before.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.30"><em>[Proxy is breathing heavily. Her voice is fragile, muted with restrained emotion.]</em></p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.31"><strong>Isis:</strong> Do you want to cry right now? Come here, munchkin.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.32">Isis Love holds Proxy Paige while the brine flows from her eyes. &quot;It was a really good day,&quot; Proxy says, her voice splintering. &quot;I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m crying. It was really extreme, and I did a lot of things I don&apos;t normally do.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.33">&quot;You&apos;re so cute,&quot; says Isis. &quot;What was the best part of the day? Your favorite part.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.34">&quot;You fisting me,&quot; says Proxy. &quot;I&apos;ve always wanted to be, like, fully fisted in the ass. I felt like that would cross some sort of, like, anal threshold, and I finally did it. It was intense.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.35">&quot;Can I have a tissue for my munchkin pie?&quot; Isis calls to the crew. Isis Love cradles Proxy Paige, and Proxy does the only thing one can do when you&apos;ve survived such an afternoon as this, which is to weep and grin and weep.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.36">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.37">As soon as&#xA0;he&apos;s out of the shower, Deen aims the F-150 Vegasward. We&apos;re on the road by 7&#xA0;p.m.&#xA0;The trip&apos;s supposed to take nine or ten hours, but James Deen&apos;s preferred number of miles per hour at which to drive is one hundred. We make it in six hours and change.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.38">On the darkened highway, we discuss Deen&apos;s life offscreen. Does James Deen have a girlfriend? He does not, not as of this writing, anyway. For six years he dated the alt-porn innovatrix Joanna Angel, but seeing civilians is generally rather ved. &quot;Either they get freaked-out about what I do before they get a chance to get to know me, or they just want to have sex like one time so they can say they fucked a porn star.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.39">Deen&apos;s boyfriend-girlfriend-type arrangements, therefore, have generally been with other sex-industry professionals. In theory, says Deen, &quot;when you&apos;re in a relationship with someone in the industry, all of the jealousy and everything should fall away.&quot; But of course, when you and your significant other are having sex with third, fourth, fifth, etc., parties for money every day, other complexities crop up. I promised Deen I would not get into the interpersonal specifics he disclosed on our many hours road-tripping together, but I will say that his relationships have been plagued by complications that have never troubled the marriage of Ann and Mitt Romney. Lately, having sex off-camera has been sort of fraught. &quot;Personal private sex is almost too intimate now,&quot; he says, citing a recent threesome when he was &quot;like almost hyperemotional, because it was personal sex without any cameras.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3a">At 8&#xA0;a.m.,&#xA0;Deen arrives at a shoot for Brazzers, a Lumbourg-based pornography concern that traffics in more traditional fare than Kink.com, with such online properties as PornstarsLikeItBig.com, MilfsLikeItBig.com, TeensLikeItBig.com, MommyGotBoobs.com, BabyGotBoobs.com, and other improvisations on these core motifs.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3b">The studio is out by the airport, in a structure you could confidently nominate in a global architectural showdown for World&apos;s Most Nondescript Building. Inside is a labyrinth of offices in various states of half-assed theatrical reinvention as hospital or hotel or school rooms. Casually scattered about are props from old shoots: a cardboard retail booth bearing the exhortation&#xA0;eat a sister&apos;s pie,&#xA0;a trombone, a sorority paddle stenciled with the words&#xA0;cunta beta deltas,&#xA0;a Sawzall with a dildo fid to the bayonet end.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3c">Deen is greeted by the director, who goes by the name Vic Lagina. Vic is tall, phlegmatic, wearing a half-sleeve baseball shirt through which large, hard pectorals are legible. Vic Lagina gives James Deen the rundown on today&apos;s script, which is Lagina&apos;s own creation. It&apos;s a 1980s rock &apos;n&apos; roll-biopic spoof with Deen playing the part of a dissolute rocker. &quot;Dewey Cocks&quot; is his character&apos;s name.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3d">For today&apos;s role, Deen is costumed in an unctuous black sternum-length wig, a slinky black halter top, and a pair of white tiger-print tights that accentuate the acreage of Deen&apos;s organ. &quot;Man, those pants make your dick look big,&quot; observes Vic Lagina.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3e">As another member of the Brazzers crew points out, Deen&apos;s stature helps enhance the appearance of genital yardage. &quot;It&apos;s like putting twenty-twos on a Civic.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3f">Quiet on the set. The first shot is this: Deen leaning against a wall to simulate an existential moment backstage. A stagehand comes along to urge him to perform. Then Dewey Cocks&apos;s manager (a gigantic black man called in the script, hilariously, WHITEY) intercedes with this line of dialogue: &quot;Dewey Cocks don&apos;t go on the stage until he recalls all the girls he has had sex with in his lifetime.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3g">&quot;I&apos;m going to try going back chronologically,&quot; Deen tells the crew from his position on the wall. After one of many takes, Deen relays the total: &quot;I got back, like, two weeks! I don&apos;t know if I can go farther.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3h">With the framing device in place, Deen spends most of the day&apos;s remainder in plural intercourse with one Tiffany Brookes and one Jessica Jaymes, who are portraying his groupies. Miss Jaymes is a ten-year vet whose huge blister-pack protrusions are somewhat at odds with her springbok svelteness. It would be a mischaracterization to say that she is a supernova of youthful enthusiasm about the project at hand. Today&apos;s shoot, as she puts it, &quot;ain&apos;t my first fuckin&apos; rodeo, bra&apos;.&quot; When she meets Deen, clad in the foul wig and tights, her response is (to Deen&apos;s unarticulated pique) &quot;I gotta fuck you in&#xA0;<em>that? </em>Do you have to fuck in that thing&#xA0;<em>[meaning the wig]</em> the whole time?<em>&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3i">Deen allows that he does.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3j">&quot;And I have to pretend I like it?&#xA0;<em>Oh, give it to me, hairy daddy,&quot;&#xA0;</em>Miss Jaymes says with a dry laugh.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3k">Okay, action! From the start, the offscreen chemistry is poor. When the camera stops rolling, all intimacy ceases. Miss Jaymes and Miss Brookes are old friends and act like a pair of collegial waitresses who have worked at the same cheap diner for many unwondrous years. Between takes they carp lightheartedly at each other for dragging ass on the shift.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3l">&quot;You didn&apos;t suck as much dick as I did.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3m">&quot;You gonna help me out with this thing?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3n">&quot;God, I want to brush my teeth.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3o">&quot;I&apos;m eating fucking bad wig hair.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3p">Deen apologizes. &quot;It came from a bag.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3q">&quot;So did I,&quot; replies Miss Jaymes.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3r">Deen eventually gets a little peevish. Miss Jaymes, in particular, attends to him so minimally that, in a subtle huff, Deen quits the scene to wring himself back to full rigor.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3s">When the sex ends, Deen is permitted to trash the hotel room. He sets about the destruction so ardently&#x2014;tearing wainscoting, shattering the television&#x2014;that one guesses the expression of frustration is partly genuine. On the drive back to our hotel, Deen confirms his discontent with the shoot.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3t">&quot;I mean, the first thing [Jessica Jaymes] said to me was, &#x2018;Oh, my God, I have to fuck you?&apos; You could say that in a nicer way. &#x2018;Your outfit is really silly looking. Oh, my God, I can&apos;t believe they&apos;re making you wear that&#x2014;that&apos;s hilarious....&apos; It&apos;s just that she wanted to make it clear that &#x2018;we are working. This is a job, and I will not sexually enjoy myself.&apos; She basically wanted to do the least amount of sex as humanly possible.... But it&apos;s fine. The product&apos;ll turn out good. On-camera it&apos;ll look like everybody had a great time.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3u">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3v">That night Deen&#xA0;holes up for fourteen hours. Midday finds him chipper and not the least bit down in the mouth about having to schlep to yet another loaner mansion to mate on-camera with yet another couple of women.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3w">Today, Deen will be playing the pornographic actor and teen idol James Deen in a word-for-word send-up of the scaremongering&#xA0;<em>Nightline</em> spot about Deen&apos;s popularity with the teen set. Deen, for his part, has mid feelings about the piece. Anchor Terry Moran, whose sneering opinings bracketed the story, is, according to Deen, &quot;just a dick.... Fuck that guy.&quot; Yet he concedes, &quot;They could have made me look bad, between all my ramblings and the dumb shit that I say, and they didn&apos;t.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3x">Playing the part of ABC&apos;s Cecilia Vega is a teeteringly thin Portuguese woman named Erica, whose immaculate blondeness and avian features lend her a passing resemblance to Callista Gingrich.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3y">And &quot;Quiet&#x2014;rolling!&quot; Deen sits on a counter stool while Erica tries with tongue-twisting effort to recite hardballs from the&#xA0;<em>Nightline</em> interview, e.g., &quot;So you have massive female following young womans. What you say to that?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.3z">&quot;If these women are looking for pornographic material on the Internet, they&apos;re obviously into sex,&quot; says Deen. &quot;They like sex. They want to explore their sexuality, which isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.40">&quot;Their parents meat,&quot; says Erica. &quot;What is meat?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.41">&quot;Might,&quot; says the director, a huskily built thirtysomething Latino guy named Huggy. &quot;Their parents might not think so.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.42">&quot;Their parents meat...&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.43">&quot;Their parents may disagree,&quot; offers Huggy.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.44">Action.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.45">&quot;Their parents may disagree.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.46">&quot;We have a girl here? Claims is your biggest fan?&quot; says Erica. &quot;James Deen, meet your biggest fan, Lazy Tailor?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.47">A nut brown young actress named Lizz Tayler scampers in. &quot;Oh, my God, oh, my God. Is it really you? Can I see your cock?&quot; Why certainly.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.48">&quot;Will you fuck me like a porn star?&quot;&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.49">After the foregoing days, any normal man would view the prospect of more tungsten-lit sex with strangers the way you might view a sixty-ounce steak after a hot-dog-eating contest. But we are beginning to learn that Deen, despite his bankable Everyman persona, is by no means a normal man. He alights from the stool with a grin.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4a">So what happens next? Oh, some oralness, some conjugal tusslings, some other things, dear reader, that after a week mooching around on pornography sets I no longer find astonishing enough to set down in print. The soul is weary. The pen is weary. I am a little abashed, a little ashamed, for having described so much in the preceding paragraphs, to have made myself your Vic Lagina, your Robby D., your personal pornographer.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4b">At this point, in answer to the query I posed at the start of our voyage, I can sincerely say that I would rather drink a mugful of live ticks than switch places with James Deen.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4c"><em>You&apos;re shittin&apos; me!&#xA0;</em>you say<em>. Why?</em> Well, not only because being impelled to couple every day with a stranger before a room of onlookers seems like an experiment dreamed up by Martian scientists. And not only because the&#xA0;<em>Groundhog Day</em>-ish sameness would, I think, accumulate to a monotony akin to a career in oyster shucking. Ultimately, for this reporter, I would be frightened that if I weren&apos;t able to recall the names of sexual partners beyond the previous two weeks, ideals like intimacy and love would begin to seem gooey and absurd, and a terrible unexamined loneliness would become the natural condition of my life. I do not voice this sentiment to Deen. It would offend him. It would come across as prudishly un-&quot;sex-positive&quot; and critical of Deen and the industry he holds dear.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4d">But he would be missing the point. What I am saying is that we may well owe a debt of gratitude to James Deen. That just as Superman makes plain why the rest of us should not jump off buildings, the extraordinary Deen and his Kryptonian psychosexual constitution illustrate why the ordinary man should not try to peg everything with opposable thumbs. All day, every day, James Deen is fucking the planet senseless so that the rest of us don&apos;t have to try to. Indeed, when the confines of monogamy begin to feel drab and claustrophobic, Deen and his adventures are just a track pad away. By the time your wife gets back from the store, you, feeling a little shabby, a little guilty, will be so glad to see her that you will never want to look upon another naked woman for at least ninety minutes or so. (Incidentally, you have the permission of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which lately disclosed that in our age of rampant web-based autoeroticism, divorce has in fact declined over the past fifteen years.)</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4e">But for now, I will speak no more of meaningless balling. From here on out, I will speak only of feelings and human connectedness.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4f">Okay, then. So. How is James Deen feeling? How is his human connectedness? I am happy to report that James Deen is feeling good, because even now, in a candid moment when the cameras are not rolling and no one is professionally obliged to have sex with him, he is lying on a black leather sectional, actively connected to Lizz Tayler in the spoon position, and he is also connected to Miss Erica, whose cooter he is jabbing with a nimble big toe. Today so much feeling, so much connectedness, abounds on the set that even after Deen&apos;s orgasm has been videoed for perpetuity, he loiters on the sofa with Miss Erica, who is grasping Deen&apos;s&#xA0;<em>ficelle</em> between the arches of her feet and laughing in a musical way.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4g">&quot;You like me, don&apos;t you?&quot; Deen asks her.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4h">She nods and chirps.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4i">&quot;Good day,&quot; says Deen. &quot;<em>Really </em>good day.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4j">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4k">And then, after&#xA0;a long, arduous, and ordinary sort of week, it is time for James Deen to shower up, climb into his Ford F-150 Raptor, and head west through the desert to the horizon of his homing. He has a shoot in Los Angeles tomorrow morning, yet the drive is a mere four hours and will put him back in time to spend an evening away from pornography. Rolling through Barstow, he places a call to some old pals in Pasadena, civilians, friends from his life before. Are they up for a visit this evening? Yes, they are, but there is an issue. Even among his trusted cronies, Deen&apos;s screen persona dogs him. A friend&apos;s sister is part of the hangout crew tonight, and the friend is rightly concerned that Deen will take the sister to bed.</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4l">&quot;Look, I&apos;m not gonna try to fuck your sister,&quot; Deen says assuringly. There is some dubious squawking from the other party. &quot;I promise, I&apos;m not gonna try to fuck your sister.&quot; It is not enough. &quot;Look,&#xA0;<em>I&apos;m not gonna try to fuck your sister!</em>&quot;Exasperation gets the better of him. At last James Deen must speak the truth:</p><p data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.4.4m">&quot;I mean, I&apos;m&#xA0;<em>going </em>to fuck your sister, but I&apos;m not going to try.&quot;</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".t9jxki1hc0.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
