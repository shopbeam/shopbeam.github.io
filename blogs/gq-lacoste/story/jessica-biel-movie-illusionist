  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWhen I told various friends I\u0027d be interviewing Jessica Biel, I got the responses you\u0027d expect—jealousy, mild rage, a plea to give her a phone number because she\u0027s the one person that a friend\u0027s wife would give him a free pass to sleep with. The uncanny thing is, when I asked these guys what they thought of her as an actress, most of them drew a blank. They hadn\u0027t seen a single motion picture of hers. Okay, one or two had girlfriends who\u0027d brought them to see The Illusionist, but otherwise, nada. As my friend Taj put it: \u0022I\u0027m obsessed with a girl I\u0027ve never seen move.\u0022\u000A\u000AWell, that\u0027s about to change. Later this month, men across America will see Jessica being very good in a very funny movie, and the nature of their love for her will…deepen. She\u0027ll still be inhumanly beautiful, sure, but now they\u0027ll have to contend with genuine talent, too, and that one-two punch can be disorienting. You know what else can? The fact that despite her recent tabloid exposure, she\u0027s actually sweet, funny, earnest, occasionally a little crude, and—if my time playing carnival games with her can be used as evidence—uniquely driven to conquer whatever stands between Jessica Biel and what she wants.\u000A\u000AI am waiting for her at the Santa Monica Pier, sitting on a stool next to one of those games where you shoot water from a gun into a clown\u0027s mouth. I haven\u0027t shaved for a week, because I read somewhere that Jessica Biel likes guys with beards. I\u0027m inspecting mine in the reflective back of my iPod when a nice-looking young woman materializes in my view.\u000A\u000A\u0022Excuse me,\u0022 she says. \u0022Are you Adam?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Jessica?\u0022 I ask, ridiculously.\u000A\u000AOf course it\u0027s her, in wraparound sunglasses, an open gray sweater over a white blouse, and faded jeans. She wears checkered Vans, like Jeff Spicoli. On the pier, no one recognizes her, which I suppose makes sense: There\u0027s little resemblance between the pinup girl and the sneaker-wearing civilian out on a Monday afternoon. She doesn\u0027t stick out as we walk the wooden planks of the amusement park; she blends in. She is, you might say, a very chill girl.\u000A\u000A\u0022Can we get a photo next to a star?\u0022 she asks, stopping in front of a booth hawking photographs with huge cardboard cutouts of celebrities. It\u0027s an impressive, eclectic array: Bill Clinton, Mini Me, Michael Jordan, Hilary Duff, Enrique Iglesias(!), Jean-Claude Van Damme, DiCaprio in Titanic. \u0022They\u0027re all kind of old,\u0022 she says. I don\u0027t know if she means the cutouts or the celebrities themselves (because to me, Mini Me will never age). She\u0027s only 25 years old, so it could go either way. I ask her who she\u0027d most want to pose with. She scrutinizes the assembly and makes her call: \u0022I\u0027d probably pick Van Damme, cause he looks the coolest.\u0022\u000A\u000AShe takes the Muscles from Brussels over Leo—a victory of might over sensitivity. Nice.\u000A\u000AThen she decides it\u0027s time for the games to begin. She passes up the Riptide Ring Toss (\u0022That one is impossible,\u0022 she says) and focuses her attention on the Pier Plank Plunge. The PPP is basically a rope ladder suspended horizontally over an inflatable mattress. The trick is to climb, perfectly balanced, to a taunting red button placed approximately ten feet away. Press the button, win the prize—an enormous Sonic the Hedgehog.\u000A\u000AI ask her if she\u0027s ever Pier Plank Plunged before. \u0022Yes,\u0022 she says, assessing the structure, looking for its weaknesses. \u0022But I\u0027ve never been able to achieve it.\u0022 She begins barraging the bored-looking carny with questions. \u0022Do you have any tips?\u0022 (It\u0027s all about balance.) \u0022Have you done it before?\u0022 (Nope.) \u0022Has anyone ever won?\u0022 (Yeah.) \u0022Has anyone won today?\u0022 (Not yet.)\u000A\u000AShe turns to me, and I have to say she seems genuinely excited. \u0022This is our chance,\u0022 she says. \u0022It\u0027s our chance to win.\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027m beginning to get the distinct impression that winning is important to Jessica Biel.\u000A\u000A\u0022Ladies first\u0022 being the imperative, I take the initial go-round. It\u0027s harder than it looks. My arms shake. Everything shakes. I can feel her hopefulness—Do it, get there—but I fall off within seconds. The shame is truly surprising. I wanted to do it for Jessica and failed. She throws me a \u0022good try\u0022 before stepping up herself.\u000A\u000AJessica was a gymnast when she was younger, and the training appears to be paying off as she mounts the unstable rope ladder. (It also occurs to me that the view I currently have is one the paparazzi would kill for.) She deploys a disciplined crawl, gets tantalizingly close to the red button, reaches for it—and loses her balance, flips over, and lands flat on the cushion, laughing. \u0022Holy shit,\u0022 she yells. \u0022It\u0027s so hard. That\u0027s so frustrating.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe carny asks if we\u0027d like to try again. She pauses for a moment, looking at the button, and then, with obvious reservations, demurs.\u000A\u000A\u0022You were really, really close,\u0022 I tell her.\u000A\u000A\u0022I know,\u0022 she says, still staring at it, reluctant to move, apparently, without conquering the damn thing. \u0022That\u0027s how it gets you.\u0022\u000A\u000ANext up is something called the Hi-Striker, a game in which you swing a mallet to test your strength. I take three feeble swings, each one less successful than the last. A huge Hispanic man laughs every time I bring the mallet down on the metal block, and when I exit the cage and hand it off to the female attendant, she takes one exhibition swing and makes my emasculation complete. Up goes the projectile. Ping goes the bell.\u000A\u000AJ.B. watches, rapt. \u0022Look at her awesome stance,\u0022 she whispers, absorbing the details, memorizing the motion. Some actors \u0022find\u0022 their characters via a process of internalization—investigating emotions, plumbing psychology, creating an \u0022inner life.\u0022 This is known as the inside-out approach. Other actors work outside-in—developing a walk, a gesture, a physicality. Look at, say, Hilary Swank in Million Dollar Baby. Look at Jessica Biel in the Hi-Striker cage.\u000A\u000AMimicking the attendant\u0027s, her first swing easily skunks my best effort. And she improves with each attempt. She\u0027s getting into character. As she exits the cage, there\u0027s a look of satisfaction on her face. She returns the mallet to the attendant, who looks at me and says: \u0022She did better than you.\u0022\u000A\u000AAs we leave, I ask her: \u0022Is it more technique than strength?\u0022\u000A\u000AShe shakes her head. \u0022Brute strength,\u0022 she says. \u0022You just throw it up and slam it as hard as you can.\u0022\u000A\u000AOn our way off the pier, we pass Zoltar, the animatronic fortune-teller who turned that kid into Tom Hanks in Big. Zoltar senses us and speaks: \u0022Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for; it is a thing to be achieved.\u0022\u000A\u000AZoltar makes Jessica smile. She digs his philosophy.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AJessica Biel\u0027s destiny, at least of late, has led her to a prominent place in the trashy supermarket gossip rags. First it was snapshots of social excursions with second-banana studs (Chris Evans, Ryan Reynolds). Then, upping the ante, there was a beach fling with a sports icon (Derek Jeter). And then, in February, she grabbed the tabloid brass ring for reportedly nabbing the world\u0027s most eligible bachelor, Justin Timberlake. Unsurprisingly, it\u0027s not something she\u0027ll discuss.\u000A\u000AOne thing she is happy talking about, though, is the unladylike girth of her knuckles. We\u0027re getting dinner at an unassuming Italian trattoria across the street from the pier when she flashes those meaty joints and describes her nascent production company. \u0022It was almost called Fat Knuckle Films. Because I have fat knuckles. See?\u0022 she asks. \u0022They don\u0027t really look that way until you start putting rings on them, and then it stops right there.\u0022\u000A\u000AI have to say, Jessica Biel\u0027s chunky midfingers are endearing, human, attainable—a word she uses a number of times in our conversation, as if to remind the world that she\u0027s just a regular girl from Boulder, Colorado, who happens to have been called, by Esquire magazine in 2005, the Sexiest Woman Alive.\u000A\u000A\u0022At first I felt really embarrassed about it,\u0022 she says. \u0022You know, it\u0027s a weird thing to talk about. Like, Hey, guys. Guess what?\u0027 You don\u0027t just go telling everybody that.\u0022\u000A\u000AShe shifts her weight forward and goes on: \u0022But after I got over that, I just started to embrace it. I started thinking, If I ever do have kids, and if they have kids, I can tell them: You know what? Your grandma in 2000-and-whatever was the Sexiest Woman Alive. How about that, kids?\u0027 That\u0027s what I started to think about. I\u0027ll always have that picture to say, That\u0027s what Granny used to look like.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ABefore coming out here to get my ass handed to me at the Hi-Striker, I immersed myself in Jessica Biel\u0027s Collected Works. She got her start in the mid-\u002790s on 7th Heaven, the WB dramedy that made a splash with the moral-values set, before leaving around 2002 for bigger (and badder) things. It\u0027s been a grim scene ever since: Summer Catch (2001), which starred Freddie Prinze Jr. and stands at number forty-nine on Rotten Tomatoes\u0027 100 Worst- Reviewed Films of All Time. The Rules of Attraction (2002), notable only for Fred Savage shooting heroin between his toes and saying things like \u0022I can feel my dick.\u0022 (Remarkably, Biel comes across as fresh and charming, despite the astonishing pointlessness and nihilism of the flick.) The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), which was Biel\u0027s first top billing and is her biggest box-office performer to date, with a take of about $80 million. J.B. screams her head off throughout the movie and is entirely believable in distress, but you can\u0027t help thinking as you watch her, There\u0027s got to be better material than this. Sadly, no. There was an atrocity called Cellular, in 2004, and Blade: Trinity that same year (in which Biel kicks much undead ass as a midriff-baring vampire hunter). But the nadir has to be London, in \u002706, a delusional piece of trash that starts off with a sex scene, Biel on top, saying, \u0022Are you coming? Are you coming?\u0022 before she proceeds to another not-quite-dignified act and then dips out of the frame to, presumably, swallow. Like I said, a grim scene.\u000A\u000AAnd then, just in the nick of time, salvation arrived. A script called The Illusionist, to star Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti. There was a problem, though. The filmmakers didn\u0027t want to give Biel an audition. They weren\u0027t convinced the vampire-hunting Hollywood creation could rearrange herself into the role of a refined fin de siècle Hungarian duchess.\u000A\u000ABut Jessica Biel has a hard time taking no for an answer. And when another actress \u0022dropped out\u0022 of the film, her tenacity paid off. They finally brought her in. She arrived wearing a full period costume. She made them take her seriously, she says, and three days later, an offer arrived.\u000A\u000AThe Illusionist wasn\u0027t what you\u0027d call a \u0022hit,\u0022 but it got good reviews, made decent money, and changed the industry\u0027s perception of her. Doors that were closed began to open. They just weren\u0027t opening fast enough for her taste.\u000A\u000AShe sets down her after-dinner tea and says, \u0022I want choices. I want options. I want to lay out all the directions I could go and have the ability to choose. I\u0027m slowly starting to have that now.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s the \u0022slowly\u0022 that kills her.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOne film that will almost surely expedite the process is I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, which will be released this month. It stars Adam Sandler and Kevin James as two Brooklyn firefighters who pretend to be a gay couple in order to receive domestic-partner benefits. J.B. plays the female lead, their hoodwinked attorney who falls for Sandler by the end of the picture.\u000A\u000AChuck and Larry is Jessica\u0027s first real shot at popular, mainstream film success. Unlike her previous big-budget endeavors, it doesn\u0027t rely on CGI or fetishistic weaponry to make its points. It is also—apologies to Freddie Prinze Jr. —her first comedy.\u000A\u000A\u0022It was a little bit intimidating,\u0022 she says. \u0022I really admire Adam and Kevin, but then, I didn\u0027t try to equal them or one-up them, and the character I created didn\u0027t have to be that. She\u0027s the straight woman, but very fun and very cool and just—attainable. That\u0027s the kind of part that I\u0027d like to play more. I mean, a vampire hunter? Is that really attainable? I\u0027d just like to play something a little more quirky, interesting, outrageous. And uninhibited.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You\u0027re not worried that she can do comedy,\u0022 the movie\u0027s director, Dennis Dugan, tells me. \u0022You can tell she can do comedy. So we just met her and cast her. I really think she can have one of those diverse, Oscar-winning careers. As far as I\u0027m concerned, there\u0027s no horizon to her talent.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe sun has gone down, and we\u0027re standing on the sidewalk in front of the Italian joint, across from the pier. I\u0027m holding a small stuffed Spider-Man doll that Jessica won as a prize back at the amusement park and which she\u0027s given to me to give to my son. I ask what she\u0027s doing tonight, and she says she\u0027s playing chaperone to a girlfriend on a first date. \u0022Basically, I\u0027m her wingman tonight,\u0022 she says. \u0022I\u0027ll probably slip away if it\u0027s rolling along well.\u0022\u000A\u000AShe graciously agrees to a photograph with me, which I would include except for two reasons: (1) I don\u0027t want to make Justin Timberlake jealous, and (2) you never quite understand how unattractive you are until you see yourself in a picture with Jessica Biel.\u000A\u000AI watch her as she walks toward the pier. I know it\u0027s where her car is parked, but I have this image of her heading straight back to the Pier Plank Plunge. The carny won\u0027t know who she is, nobody on the pier will recognize her, and she\u0027ll just hand over her fiver and go at it. That red button, almost within her reach. Attainable.\u000A\u000AAdam Stein is a writer and actor living in New York City.",

friends I&#x2019;d be interviewing Jessica Biel, I got the responses you&#x2019;d expect&#x2014;jealousy, mild rage, a plea to give her a phone number because she&#x2019;s the one person that a friend&#x2019;s wife would give him a free pass to sleep with. The uncanny thing is, when I asked these guys what they thought of her as an actress, most of them drew a blank. They hadn&#x2019;t seen a single motion picture of hers. Okay, one or two had girlfriends who&#x2019;d brought them to see <em>The Illusionist</em>, but otherwise, nada. As my friend Taj put it: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m obsessed with a girl I&#x2019;ve never seen <em>move</em>.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.2">Well, that&#x2019;s about to change. Later this month, men across America will see Jessica being very good in a very funny movie, and the nature of their love for her will&#x2026;deepen. She&#x2019;ll still be inhumanly beautiful, sure, but now they&#x2019;ll have to contend with genuine talent, too, and that one-two punch can be disorienting. You know what else can? The fact that despite her recent tabloid exposure, she&#x2019;s actually sweet, funny, earnest, occasionally a little crude, and&#x2014;if my time playing carnival games with her can be used as evidence&#x2014;uniquely driven to conquer whatever stands between Jessica Biel and what she wants.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.3">I am waiting for her at the Santa Monica Pier, sitting on a stool next to one of those games where you shoot water from a gun into a clown&#x2019;s mouth. I haven&#x2019;t shaved for a week, because I read somewhere that Jessica Biel likes guys with beards. I&#x2019;m inspecting mine in the reflective back of my iPod when a nice-looking young woman materializes in my view.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.5">&#x201C;Excuse me,&#x201C; she says. &#x201C;Are you Adam?&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.6">&#x201C;Jessica?&#x201C; I ask, ridiculously.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.7">Of course it&#x2019;s her, in wraparound sunglasses, an open gray sweater over a white blouse, and faded jeans. She wears checkered Vans, like Jeff Spicoli. On the pier, no one recognizes her, which I suppose makes sense: There&#x2019;s little resemblance between the pinup girl and the sneaker-wearing civilian out on a Monday afternoon. She doesn&#x2019;t stick out as we walk the wooden planks of the amusement park; she blends in. She is, you might say, a very chill girl.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.8">&#x201C;Can we get a photo next to a star?&#x201C; she asks, stopping in front of a booth hawking photographs with huge cardboard cutouts of celebrities. It&#x2019;s an impressive, eclectic array: Bill Clinton, Mini Me, Michael Jordan, Hilary Duff, Enrique Iglesias(!), Jean-Claude Van Damme, DiCaprio in <em>Titanic</em>. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re all kind of old,&#x201C; she says. I don&#x2019;t know if she means the cutouts or the celebrities themselves (because to me, Mini Me will never age). She&#x2019;s only 25 years old, so it could go either way. I ask her who she&#x2019;d most want to pose with. She scrutinizes the assembly and makes her call: &#x201C;I&#x2019;d probably pick Van Damme, &#x91;cause he looks the coolest.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.9">She takes the Muscles from Brussels over Leo&#x2014;a victory of might over sensitivity. Nice.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.a">Then she decides it&#x2019;s time for the games to begin. She passes up the Riptide Ring Toss (&#x201C;That one is impossible,&#x201C; she says) and focuses her attention on the Pier Plank Plunge. The PPP is basically a rope ladder suspended horizontally over an inflatable mattress. The trick is to climb, perfectly balanced, to a taunting red button placed approximately ten feet away. Press the button, win the prize&#x2014;an enormous Sonic the Hedgehog.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.b">I ask her if she&#x2019;s ever Pier Plank Plunged before. &#x201C;Yes,&#x201C; she says, assessing the structure, looking for its weaknesses. &#x201C;But I&#x2019;ve never been able to achieve it.&#x201C; She begins barraging the bored-looking carny with questions. &#x201C;Do you have any tips?&#x201C; (It&#x2019;s all about balance.) &#x201C;Have you done it before?&#x201C; (Nope.) &#x201C;Has anyone ever won?&#x201C; (Yeah.) &#x201C;Has anyone won today?&#x201C; (Not yet.)</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.c">She turns to me, and I have to say she seems genuinely excited. &#x201C;This is our chance,&#x201C; she says. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s our chance to win.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.d">I&#x2019;m beginning to get the distinct impression that winning is important to Jessica Biel.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.e">&#x201C;Ladies first&#x201C; being the imperative, I take the initial go-round. It&#x2019;s harder than it looks. My arms shake. Everything shakes. I can feel her hopefulness&#x2014;<em>Do it, get there</em>&#x2014;but I fall off within seconds. The shame is truly surprising. I wanted to do it for Jessica and failed. She throws me a &#x201C;good try&#x201C; before stepping up herself.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.f">Jessica was a gymnast when she was younger, and the training appears to be paying off as she mounts the unstable rope ladder. (It also occurs to me that the view I currently have is one the paparazzi would kill for.) She deploys a disciplined crawl, gets tantalizingly close to the red button, reaches for it&#x2014;and loses her balance, flips over, and lands flat on the cushion, laughing. &#x201C;Holy shit,&#x201C; she yells. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s so hard. That&#x2019;s so frustrating.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.g">The carny asks if we&#x2019;d like to try again. She pauses for a moment, looking at the button, and then, with obvious reservations, demurs.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.h">&#x201C;You were really, really close,&#x201C; I tell her.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.i">&#x201C;I know,&#x201C; she says, still staring at it, reluctant to move, apparently, without conquering the damn thing. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s how it gets you.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.j">Next up is something called the Hi-Striker, a game in which you swing a mallet to test your strength. I take three feeble swings, each one less successful than the last. A huge Hispanic man laughs every time I bring the mallet down on the metal block, and when I exit the cage and hand it off to the female attendant, she takes one exhibition swing and makes my emasculation complete. Up goes the projectile. <em>Ping</em> goes the bell.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.k">J.B. watches, rapt. &#x201C;Look at her awesome stance,&#x201C; she whispers, absorbing the details, memorizing the motion. Some actors &#x201C;find&#x201C; their characters via a process of internalization&#x2014;investigating emotions, plumbing psychology, creating an &#x201C;inner life.&#x201C; This is known as the inside-out approach. Other actors work outside-in&#x2014;developing a walk, a gesture, a physicality. Look at, say, Hilary Swank in <em>Million Dollar Baby</em>. Look at Jessica Biel in the Hi-Striker cage.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.l">Mimicking the attendant&#x2019;s, her first swing easily skunks my best effort. And she improves with each attempt. She&#x2019;s getting into character. As she exits the cage, there&#x2019;s a look of satisfaction on her face. She returns the mallet to the attendant, who looks at me and says: &#x201C;She did better than you.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.m">As we leave, I ask her: &#x201C;Is it more technique than strength?&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.n">She shakes her head. &#x201C;Brute strength,&#x201C; she says. &#x201C;You just throw it up and slam it as hard as you can.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.o">On our way off the pier, we pass Zoltar, the animatronic fortune-teller who turned that kid into Tom Hanks in <em>Big</em>. Zoltar senses us and speaks: &#x201C;Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for; it is a thing to be achieved.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.p">Zoltar makes Jessica smile. She digs his philosophy.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.q"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.r">Jessica Biel&#x2019;s destiny, at least of late, has led her to a prominent place in the trashy supermarket gossip rags. First it was snapshots of social excursions with second-banana studs (Chris Evans, Ryan Reynolds). Then, upping the ante, there was a beach fling with a sports icon (Derek Jeter). And then, in February, she grabbed the tabloid brass ring for reportedly nabbing the world&#x2019;s most eligible bachelor, Justin Timberlake. Unsurprisingly, it&#x2019;s not something she&#x2019;ll discuss.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.s">One thing she <em>is</em> happy talking about, though, is the unladylike girth of her knuckles. We&#x2019;re getting dinner at an unassuming Italian trattoria across the street from the pier when she flashes those meaty joints and describes her nascent production company. &#x201C;It was almost called Fat Knuckle Films. Because I have fat knuckles. See?&#x201C; she asks. &#x201C;They don&#x2019;t really look that way until you start putting rings on them, and then it stops right there.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.t">I have to say, Jessica Biel&#x2019;s chunky midfingers are endearing, human, <em>attainable</em>&#x2014;a word she uses a number of times in our conversation, as if to remind the world that she&#x2019;s just a regular girl from Boulder, Colorado, who happens to have been called, by <em>Esquire</em> magazine in 2005, the Sexiest Woman Alive.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.u">&#x201C;At first I felt really embarrassed about it,&#x201C; she says. &#x201C;You know, it&#x2019;s a weird thing to talk about. Like, &#x91;Hey, guys. Guess what?&#x2019; You don&#x2019;t just go telling everybody that.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.v">She shifts her weight forward and goes on: &#x201C;But after I got over that, I just started to embrace it. I started thinking, If I ever do have kids, and if they have kids, I can tell them: &#x91;You know what? Your grandma in 2000-and-whatever was the Sexiest Woman Alive. How about that, kids?&#x2019; That&#x2019;s what I started to think about. I&#x2019;ll always have that picture to say, &#x91;That&#x2019;s what Granny used to look like.&#x2019; &#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.w">Before coming out here to get my ass handed to me at the Hi-Striker, I immersed myself in Jessica Biel&#x2019;s Collected Works. She got her start in the mid-&#x2019;90s on <em>7th Heaven</em>, the WB dramedy that made a splash with the moral-values set, before leaving around 2002 for bigger (and badder) things. It&#x2019;s been a grim scene ever since: <em>Summer Catch</em> (2001), which starred Freddie Prinze Jr. and stands at number forty-nine on Rotten Tomatoes&#x2019; 100 Worst- Reviewed Films of All Time. <em>The Rules of Attraction</em> (2002), notable only for Fred Savage shooting heroin between his toes and saying things like &#x201C;I can feel my dick.&#x201C; (Remarkably, Biel comes across as fresh and charming, despite the astonishing pointlessness and nihilism of the flick.) <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (2003), which was Biel&#x2019;s first top billing and is her biggest box-office performer to date, with a take of about $80 million. J.B. screams her head off throughout the movie and is entirely believable in distress, but you can&#x2019;t help thinking as you watch her, There&#x2019;s got to be better material than this. Sadly, no. There was an atrocity called <em>Cellular</em>, in 2004, and <em>Blade: Trinity</em> that same year (in which Biel kicks much undead ass as a midriff-baring vampire hunter). But the nadir has to be <em>London</em>, in &#x2019;06, a delusional piece of trash that starts off with a sex scene, Biel on top, saying, &#x201C;Are you coming? Are you coming?&#x201C; before she proceeds to another not-quite-dignified act and then dips out of the frame to, presumably, swallow. Like I said, a grim scene.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.x">And then, just in the nick of time, salvation arrived. A script called <em>The Illusionist</em>, to star Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti. There was a problem, though. The filmmakers didn&#x2019;t want to give Biel an audition. They weren&#x2019;t convinced the vampire-hunting Hollywood creation could rearrange herself into the role of a refined fin de si&#xE8;cle Hungarian duchess.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.y">But Jessica Biel has a hard time taking no for an answer. And when another actress &#x201C;dropped out&#x201C; of the film, her tenacity paid off. They finally brought her in. She arrived wearing a full period costume. She made them take her seriously, she says, and three days later, an offer arrived.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.z"><em>The Illusionist</em> wasn&#x2019;t what you&#x2019;d call a &#x201C;hit,&#x201C; but it got good reviews, made decent money, and changed the industry&#x2019;s perception of her. Doors that were closed began to open. They just weren&#x2019;t opening fast enough for her taste.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.10">She sets down her after-dinner tea and says, &#x201C;I want choices. I want options. I want to lay out all the directions I could go and have the ability to choose. I&#x2019;m slowly starting to have that now.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.11">It&#x2019;s the &#x201C;slowly&#x201C; that kills her.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.12"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.13">One film that will almost surely expedite the process is <em>I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry</em>, which will be released this month. It stars Adam Sandler and Kevin James as two Brooklyn firefighters who pretend to be a gay couple in order to receive domestic-partner benefits. J.B. plays the female lead, their hoodwinked attorney who falls for Sandler by the end of the picture.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.14"><em>Chuck and Larry</em> is Jessica&#x2019;s first real shot at popular, mainstream film success. Unlike her previous big-budget endeavors, it doesn&#x2019;t rely on CGI or fetishistic weaponry to make its points. It is also&#x2014;apologies to Freddie Prinze Jr. &#x2014;her first comedy.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.15">&#x201C;It was a little bit intimidating,&#x201C; she says. &#x201C;I really admire Adam and Kevin, but then, I didn&#x2019;t try to equal them or one-up them, and the character I created didn&#x2019;t have to be that. She&#x2019;s the straight woman, but very fun and very cool and just&#x2014;attainable. That&#x2019;s the kind of part that I&#x2019;d like to play more. I mean, a vampire hunter? Is that really attainable? I&#x2019;d just like to play something a little more quirky, interesting, outrageous. And uninhibited.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.16">&#x201C;You&#x2019;re not worried that she can do comedy,&#x201C; the movie&#x2019;s director, Dennis Dugan, tells me. &#x201C;You can tell she can do comedy. So we just met her and cast her. I really think she can have one of those diverse, Oscar-winning careers. As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, there&#x2019;s no horizon to her talent.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.17">The sun has gone down, and we&#x2019;re standing on the sidewalk in front of the Italian joint, across from the pier. I&#x2019;m holding a small stuffed Spider-Man doll that Jessica won as a prize back at the amusement park and which she&#x2019;s given to me to give to my son. I ask what she&#x2019;s doing tonight, and she says she&#x2019;s playing chaperone to a girlfriend on a first date. &#x201C;Basically, I&#x2019;m her wingman tonight,&#x201C; she says. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll probably slip away if it&#x2019;s rolling along well.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.18">She graciously agrees to a photograph with me, which I would include except for two reasons: <em>(1)</em> I don&#x2019;t want to make Justin Timberlake jealous, and <em>(2)</em> you never quite understand how unattractive you are until you see yourself in a picture with Jessica Biel.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.19">I watch her as she walks toward the pier. I know it&#x2019;s where her car is parked, but I have this image of her heading straight back to the Pier Plank Plunge. The carny won&#x2019;t know who she is, nobody on the pier will recognize her, and she&#x2019;ll just hand over her fiver and go at it. That red button, almost within her reach. Attainable.</p><p data-reactid=".6mh7hbx0jk.1.1.0.0.4.1a"><strong>Adam Stein</strong> is a writer and actor living in New York City.</p></div><div class="grid"
