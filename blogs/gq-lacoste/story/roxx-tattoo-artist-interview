  	    "articleBody": "Here\u0027s the weird thing about Roxx, the founder and owner of 2Spirit Tattoo in San Francisco: Most of her clients are tattoo virgins. \u0022People who come to me are people that really didn\u0027t want to get tattooed that much,\u0022 the London transplant says. \u0022Then they saw my work and something changed.\u0022 Which makes sense: In an epidermic ocean of bad decisions and fuzzy Sailor Jerry knockoffs, Roxx\u0027s organic geometry style stands out immediately. She does huge tapestries of blackwork, with complicated geometric patterns that look more like Martian architecture than body art. A few weeks ago, we spoke with her about how her style has evolved and what it\u0027s like to be the woman at the helm of the ink world\u0027s coolest artistic movement. Oh, and horses.\u000A\u000AI think I read in your bio you started out sketching horses or something. How long have you been doing this now? I\u0027ve been drawing since I was, like, two years old. Mostly horses. [laughs] I\u0027ve been drawing for years, but I started tattooing when I was 15—which is almost 30 years ago now. I\u0027ve been in this business for a very long time. I had a few other jobs as a teenager, but I\u0027m self-taught. I had to figure it out myself. No apprenticeship or anything.  \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHow were you practicing? Were you tattooing on yourself?I started on myself. When I started tattooing, it was in the heyday of punk rock in the U.K., where I come from. There were a lot of willing candidates to let me do my beginner stuff on. Being a graphic artist anyway, it was not that difficult to translate. But it\u0027s one of those things that requires a great deal of practice, like playing the piano. The longer you do it, the better you get.\u000A\u000AWhat was your first tattoo?I think it was some Japanese kanji in 1986. There was also, like, some silly quote from Oscar Wilde… [pauses] I don\u0027t think I want to say what it is. [laughs]\u000A\u000AFair enough! So you\u0027ve been doing this a long time now, then. Are you at a point in your career where you\u0027re mentoring other artists?There are a couple of amazing people in my studio. One is my partner, Cats—she came here a few years ago, and I\u0027ve been helping her bring her own vision out. She\u0027s doing amazing work. And I just took on this amazing new artist, a guy who goes under Thieves of Tower. They have a really unique expression, and they\u0027re working with me now to bring that out. \u000A\u000ACan you talk a little bit about your journey to your current style? What kind of stuff did you start out doing?I was always really into blackwork and tribals, which were the thing of the day back then. It was a very popular style in the \u002780s. And so that\u0027s what I wanted to do—I wanted to become a tribal tattooer. I explored the many styles that come from various indigenous cultures in the world. I did that for a long, long time. I\u0027ve done Japanese work, biomechanical, [and more]. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestInstagram\u000A\u000AThen more and more artists got into it. I was doing that a really long time, so I started blowing those designs up to become more graphic but less detailed. And I got bored with that. I started really wittling things down to really simplistic shapes. I really got into the forms for the sake of geometry, things woven from the fabric of nature. \u000A\u000AI was kind of a rabid tattooer. When you tattoo a great deal, you start moving through different phases. Because after two years of doing the same thing, I wanted to do a bunch of colorwork. So that\u0027s what got me to my style now. I\u0027m kind of moving through that now, and instead I\u0027m doing more abstract, minimal stuff.\u000A\u000AMy general kind of client is people who don\u0027t have a lot of tattoos, or any at all, and then get huuuuge things.Twitter\u000A\u000AWhen you talk about being inspired by nature, what kinds of things are you looking at? It\u0027s taking things down to a microscopic level. The structure of leaves and shells—basically just looking deeper into the molecular things that things are made up of. Seeing the repeating patterns and the geometry, the stuff that\u0027s always fascinated mystics and philosophers and shamans; how to make sense of the universe. It\u0027s about the puzzles of things. It kind of just never ends up getting boring. You go deeper and deeper into it.  \u000A\u000ADo you find your work attracts a specific type of clientele?My general kind of client is people who don\u0027t have a lot of tattoos, or any at all, and then get huuuuge  things. I don\u0027t know. For some reason, something I do speaks to them. My work is something unique...or at least that\u0027s what I\u0027ve heard. [laughs]\u000A\u000AHow long does it take you to do one of those big pieces?Nowadays, most of my clients fly in from another country. It\u0027s like two or three days at a time, if not more. And then they come again for another two or three days, and we add on and finish things. That\u0027s how my clientele works these days. It\u0027s people flying in from the airport every five minutes. It\u0027s a lot of pressure.\u000A\u000AWhy is it a lot of pressure?When someone\u0027s flown halfway across the world, I mean, it\u0027s still a pretty big deal to me. That someone would come that far, pay the hotel, pay for the cars, hotel, flight, and the tattoo? For me?  \u000A\u000AHow do you prepare mentally for those sorts of monster sessions?I go to bed pretty early. I have quite a life with my horses outside of tattooing, and I start my day like that every day. So I\u0027m out in nature, and then I get back into the city, and I don\u0027t really think about it too much anymore. When I was younger, 10 years in, I used to get really anxious about the art I was making, because I would be so invested in making it well. I found that the more I let go of that, the more I let that happen.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s your actual tattooing process like?I don\u0027t draw until the client comes in. A lot of times, I just draw the design straight onto their body, at least for 90% of what I do. I pre-edit in the moment, which has helped me have a life outside of my work. When you\u0027re drawing things straight onto the body, they have another magical quality to them that is often lost.\u000A\u000AI can\u0027t even picture what those conversations are like. Like how do your clients tell you, \u0022I want this crazy geometric thing on my neck\u0022 or whatever?Usually they email me pictures from my portfolio and say, \u0022I love this piece.\u0022 Then they do, like, three to five pictures of work that I\u0027ve done, so I get a general idea of what they\u0027re into and what would make them happy and what they envision. I try to take their idea and rocket it up a few thousand degrees. [laughs]\u000A\u000ATaking their energy and mixing it with mine and creating this other thing that exemplifies what they want to say, what they want to feel. When you\u0027ve been doing something so long, it\u0027s kind of easy and it flows kind of well.\u000A\u000AHow do you see your style evolving?I\u0027m really into stripped-down sophistication. Sometimes the simplest forms have such a great impact. Certain clients do say they want something curved, or they\u0027ll want something linear. Do they want something black, or do they want something patterned, or a mixture of both? Those are my categories now. Those are the things that I work between now. The person I\u0027m doing today has a full arm of the most intense geometry. I love it. Then, the next day, I\u0027ll just do a black line down someone\u0027s body. It balances out a little. I don\u0027t like sticking to one thing.",

href="http://2spirittattoo.com/">2Spirit Tattoo in San Francisco</a>: Most of her clients are tattoo virgins. &#x201C;People who come to me are people that really didn&#x2019;t want to get tattooed that much,&#x201D; the London transplant says. &#x201C;Then they saw my work and something changed.&#x201D; Which makes sense: In an epidermic ocean of bad decisions and fuzzy Sailor Jerry knockoffs, Roxx&apos;s organic geometry style stands out immediately. She does huge tapestries of blackwork, with complicated geometric patterns that look more like Martian architecture than body art. A few weeks ago, we spoke with her about how her style has evolved and what it&#x2019;s like to be the woman at the helm of the ink world&#x2019;s coolest artistic movement. Oh, and horses.</p><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.1"><strong>I think I read in your bio you started out sketching horses or something. How long have you been doing this now?</strong> <br>I&#x2019;ve been drawing since I was, like, two years old. Mostly horses. [<em>laughs</em>] I&#x2019;ve been drawing for years, but I started tattooing when I was 15&#x2014;which is almost 30 years ago now. I&#x2019;ve been in this business for a very long time. I had a few other jobs as a teenager, but I&#x2019;m self-taught. I had to figure it out myself. No apprenticeship or anything.  </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.2"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55d1f917fb580c9d7656023d/master/w_600/roxx-2.jpg" alt="roxx-2.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Froxx-tattoo-artist-interview&amp;t=roxx-2.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Froxx-tattoo-artist-interview&amp;t=roxx-2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Froxx-tattoo-artist-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55d1f917fb580c9d7656023d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Froxx-2.jpg&amp;description=roxx-2.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Froxx-tattoo-artist-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55d1f917fb580c9d7656023d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Froxx-2.jpg&amp;description=roxx-2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>How were you practicing? Were you tattooing on yourself?</strong><br>I started on myself. When I started tattooing, it was in the heyday of punk rock in the U.K., where I come from. There were a lot of willing candidates to let me do my beginner stuff on. Being a graphic artist anyway, it was not that difficult to translate. But it&#x2019;s one of those things that requires a great deal of practice, like playing the piano. The longer you do it, the better you get.</p><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>What was your first tattoo?</strong><br>I think it was some Japanese kanji in 1986. There was also, like, some silly quote from Oscar Wilde&#x2026; [<em>pauses</em>] I don&#x2019;t think I want to say what it is. [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Fair enough! So you&apos;ve been doing this a long time now, then. Are you at a point in your career where you&apos;re mentoring other artists?</strong><br>There are a couple of amazing people in my studio. One is my partner, Cats&#x2014;she came here a few years ago, and I&#x2019;ve been helping her bring her own vision out. She&#x2019;s doing amazing work. And I just took on this amazing new artist, a guy who goes under Thieves of Tower. They have a really unique expression, and they&#x2019;re working with me now to bring that out. </p><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Can you talk a little bit about your journey to your current style? What kind of stuff did you start out doing?</strong><br>I was always really into blackwork and tribals, which were the thing of the day back then. It was a very popular style in the &#x2019;80s. And so that&#x2019;s what I wanted to do&#x2014;I wanted to become a tribal tattooer. I explored the many styles that come from various indigenous cultures in the world. I did that for a long, long time. I&#x2019;ve done Japanese work, biomechanical, [and more]. </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.8"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55d1fbc2723483396f2c9da5/master/w_806/roxx-instagram.jpg" alt="roxx-instagram.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Froxx-tattoo-artist-interview&amp;t=roxx-instagram.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Froxx-tattoo-artist-interview&amp;t=roxx-instagram.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Froxx-tattoo-artist-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55d1fbc2723483396f2c9da5%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Froxx-instagram.jpg&amp;description=roxx-instagram.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Froxx-tattoo-artist-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55d1fbc2723483396f2c9da5%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Froxx-instagram.jpg&amp;description=roxx-instagram.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Instagram</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.9">Then more and more artists got into it. I was doing that a really long time, so I started blowing those designs up to become more graphic but less detailed. And I got bored with that. I started really wittling things down to really simplistic shapes. I really got into the forms for the sake of geometry, things woven from the fabric of nature. </p><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.a">I was kind of a rabid tattooer. When you tattoo a great deal, you start moving through different phases. Because after two years of doing the same thing, I wanted to do a bunch of colorwork. So that&#x2019;s what got me to my style now. I&#x2019;m kind of moving through that now, and instead I&#x2019;m doing more abstract, minimal stuff.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.b"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>My general kind of client is people who don&#x2019;t have a lot of tattoos, or any at all, and then get huuuuge things.</p></blockquote></span><div class="pullquote-share twitter"><a class="pullquote-share-icon" href="https://twitter.com/share?via=GQ&amp;text=%22My%20general%20kind%20of%20client%20is%20people%20who%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20a%20lot%20of%20tattoos%2C%20or%20any%20at%20all%2C%20and%20then%20get%20huuuuge%20things.%22" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>When you talk about being inspired by nature, what kinds of things are you looking at?</strong> <br>It&#x2019;s taking things down to a microscopic level.

Seeing the repeating patterns and the geometry, the stuff that&#x2019;s always fascinated mystics and philosophers and shamans; how to make sense of the universe. It&#x2019;s about the puzzles of things. It kind of just never ends up getting boring.

I don&#x2019;t know. For some reason, something I do speaks to them. My work is something unique...or at least that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve heard. [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>How long does it take you to do one of those big pieces?</strong><br>Nowadays, most of my clients fly in from another country. It&#x2019;s like two or three days at a time, if not more. And then they come again for another two or three days, and we add on and finish things. That&#x2019;s how my clientele works these days. It&#x2019;s people flying in from the airport every five minutes. It&#x2019;s a lot of pressure.</p><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Why is it a lot of pressure?</strong><br>When someone&#x2019;s flown halfway across the world, I mean, it&#x2019;s still a pretty big deal to me. That someone would come that far, pay the hotel, pay for the cars, hotel, flight, and the tattoo? For me?  </p><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>How do you prepare mentally for those sorts of monster sessions?</strong><br>I go to bed pretty early. I have quite a life with my horses outside of tattooing, and I start my day like that every day. So I&#x2019;m out in nature, and then I get back into the city, and I don&#x2019;t really think about it too much anymore. When I was younger, 10 years in, I used to get really anxious about the art I was making, because I would be so invested in making it well.

A lot of times, I just draw the design straight onto their body, at least for 90% of what I do. I pre-edit in the moment, which has helped me have a life outside of my work. When you&#x2019;re drawing things straight onto the body, they have another magical quality to them that is often lost.</p><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>I can&#x2019;t even picture what those conversations are like. Like how do your clients tell you, &#x201C;I want this crazy geometric thing on my neck&#x201D; or whatever?</strong><br>Usually they email me pictures from my portfolio and say, &#x201C;I love this piece.&#x201D; Then they do, like, three to five pictures of work that I&#x2019;ve done, so I get a general idea of what they&#x2019;re into and what would make them happy and what they envision. I try to take their idea and rocket it up a few thousand degrees. [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.k">Taking their energy and mixing it with mine and creating this other thing that exemplifies what they want to say, what they want to feel. When you&#x2019;ve been doing something so long, it&#x2019;s kind of easy and it flows kind of well.</p><p data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>How do you see your style evolving?</strong><br>I&#x2019;m really into stripped-down sophistication. Sometimes the simplest forms have such a great impact. Certain clients do say they want something curved, or they&#x2019;ll want something linear. Do they want something black, or do they want something patterned, or a mixture of both? Those are my categories now. Those are the things that I work between now. The person I&#x2019;m doing today has a full arm of the most intense geometry. I love it. Then, the next day, I&#x2019;ll just do a black line down someone&#x2019;s body. It balances out a little. I don&#x2019;t like sticking to one thing.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".gizy6cxc74.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
