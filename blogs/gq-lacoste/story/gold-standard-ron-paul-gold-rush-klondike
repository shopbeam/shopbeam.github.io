  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe legion of hack travel writers who\u0027ve described the streets of Dawson City as \u0022literally paved with gold\u0022 are sort of telling the truth. Dawson, which lies at the scenic crotch of the Klondike and Yukon rivers in Canada\u0027s Yukon Territory, sprang up in 1896 during the Klondike Stampede, and a century after the first gold rush petered out, the latest global gold mania is again rippling village life in this town of 1,800. When I visit in the summer of 2011, with the price of gold at record highs, the very dirt under the city has become controversially precious. One prospector is pissing people off by trying to mine a local road. Rumor has it owners of the Westminster Hotel got into trouble for sinking a shaft under the saloon. By law, you can\u0027t start your own gold mine within city limits, though according to scuttlebutt, a few local householders are furtively mining their basements.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s boom times in Dawson for a simple reason: Gold loves bad news. When the economy slumps, lots of people suddenly wake up to the frightening, psychedelic truth that our entire financial system rests on the internationally abetted illusion that government-issued pieces of green paper have intrinsic value. To safeguard their riches against inflation or, as some have it, the collapse of Western civilization, these people buy large quantities of a soft yellow mineral that also has no intrinsic value. So do daisy chains of speculators, and the price of gold goes up and up and up.\u000A\u000ASo now, with gold at 500 percent of its price pre–September 11, speculators and mother-lode seekers are pouring back into the hills and valleys around Dawson. A local aphorism estimates that out of every hundred miners to stake a claim, ninety-nine will lose their shirts. Still, fifty new gold-exploration companies have hit town in recent years. And claims have skyrocketed from 28,000 in 2009 to 80,000 in 2011. All of which is trailing the symptoms of an economy in overdrive. Unemployment is approximately zero. Monthly rents aren\u0027t much cheaper than Brooklyn\u0027s. In the grocery store on Front Street, a case of Aquafina water sells for $32.99, plus deposit.\u000A\u000AThe bulk of the action isn\u0027t in Dawson but in the far-flung boondocks. And the throngs of gold tourists—expecting toothless coots jigging down Front Street with fistfuls of nuggets—aren\u0027t quite sure what to do with themselves other than wander the clapboard village painted in merry hues. On a cursory prowl my first night, the only identifiable mania is happening over at the Sourdough Saloon, where a mob is clamoring to drink the house specialty, a shot of liquor garnished with a human toe.\u000A\u000AThe toe cocktail dates from the 1970s. The first toe belonged to a frostbite victim, but somebody swallowed that one. In years since, open calls for toe donations have been answered by sufferers of diabetes, frostbite, lawn-mowing accidents, and a woman with an inoperable corn.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADawson\u0027s Disneyish downtown has new visitors: gold tourists.\u000A\u000ATourist hokery aside, the toe, a big one, is authentically revolting. It looks like a rotten prune shingled with a sulfur-colored toenail. An unappetizing bit of bone peeks from the knuckle. The shaft bit looks a little beat up, slightly gnawed. When the guy ahead of me takes his turn, I see how it got that way. According to rules of the rite, you\u0027re supposed to let the toe at least bang against your lips, but this guy—rising to a moment in the spotlight— takes it into his mouth and chews it before spitting it back into the glass.\u000A\u000AWhy does anyone do this? I put the question to a Quebecois college kid queued with some pals behind me. \u0022There\u0027s supposed to be a gold rush, but you can\u0027t see it,\u0022 he reflects. \u0022So we came here to drink the toe. The toe you can see.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AIf you actually want to see the gold rush, you have to catch a helicopter to a ridge in the bush about fifty trailless miles from Dawson. When I arrive, I find five guys from an exploration company who have been camped here since June. Everyone is hairy. The smell about them is strong but wholesome. Not unwashed homeless so much as unwashed elk, a natural musk.\u000A\u000AThe land here makes your jaw hang open. Peaks and ridges arrayed in an unending motley dentition so vast that, if they have names, nobody knows what they are. Some are gray and jagged as broken bones. Others are zaftig and green and seem to want golfers. Late snow gleams in a few drainages, bright as a fuse. Mosquitoes with denim-piercing lances swarm. Still, not a bad place to clock in every day, I observe to a short, bearded fellow whose name I don\u0027t catch. \u0022This is the best and worst job I\u0027ve ever had,\u0022 he replies. \u0022You get to jump out of helicopters and walk hills nobody\u0027s ever walked on before. But most mornings you\u0027re like, fuck, I\u0027ve gotta climb a mountain in the pouring rain.\u0022\u000A\u000ADawson\u0027s current gold rush doesn\u0027t much resemble the mad scramble of 1896. Those old-timers were sluicing \u0022placer\u0022 (pronounced \u0022plasser\u0022) gold, little flakes and nuggets that fetch up in creek gravel, the same stuff that now sustains about 140 mostly mom-and-pop operations, territory-wide. The current mania is a search for hard-rock gold, the slowly eroding source of all the placer flakelets. The chancy thing with hard-rock gold is that it\u0027s buried deep in the bedrock and therefore requires mountain-pureeing technology (and massive corporate capitalization) to recover, but local geologists speculate that the Yukon\u0027s hard-rock claims could yield a million ounces or more.\u000A\u000AAt the movement\u0027s vanguard is a guy named Shawn Ryan. Back in the 1990s, when the price of gold was limping along between $250 and $400 an ounce, nobody except Ryan saw the point in bushwhacking remote hills in search of gold not worth the money it would cost to dig up. Ryan made a careful study of aerial-magnetic-imaging surveys of the mountains around Dawson, looking for the mineralogical symptoms of gold. When he could scrape the money together, he\u0027d go out and stake claims. In the laissez-faire law of the Yukon, anybody can drive a pair of stakes into a spot of ground and, for a $10 fee, secure the mineral rights to a fifty-two-acre plot. Ryan currently holds over 45,000 claims, spanning more square mileage than Delaware. So far his efforts haven\u0027t yielded enough gold to gild a toothpick, yet Ryan himself, formerly scraping by as a freelance mushroom gatherer, has leased his claims to an exploration company (he\u0027s now its president) and is worth at least $15 million.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AA day\u0027s wages at a mom-and-pop mine.\u000A\u000AThe mission of the one-hundred-plus hard-rock operations out here this summer isn\u0027t to mine the ground themselves but to grab as much land as possible and flip it once more to an even larger international mining company. But a multinational conglomerate like Kinross isn\u0027t going to cut you a check just because you\u0027ve got some ground. The sales pitch requires assay results from rock and soil samples, tons of them. So the big hard-rock stampede right now doesn\u0027t look like people striking it rich. It looks like hundreds of mostly young men humping the nameless boonies, putting dirt in plastic bags.\u000A\u000AI\u0027m spending the day tailing Morgan Fraughton, sergeant of this particular dirtbagging platoon. His work is this: Every day, the chopper deposits him on a spot of often harsh terrain. Then he takes a seven-hour walk, bending over every 165 feet to fill a bag with dirt. \u0022It can be pretty miserable,\u0022 he says. \u0022But just surviving it, you feel like a man, like you\u0027re in this battle with yourself and winning.\u0022\u000A\u000AOn the ridge, he checks the GPS, unholsters his soil auger—an oversize T-handled tool whose business end is the helically twisted eye of an oversize embroidery needle. With an effortful crunch, he wrenches it into the ground and pulls out a leaden parfait of earth. The sample is a good one, eroded bedrock. If there\u0027s any gold in there, it\u0027s present in some small number of parts per billion, invisible to the naked eye. \u0022A great sample, easy to get to. This is really awesome dirt,\u0022 Morgan says.\u000A\u000AMorgan\u0027s been doing this for three years—a pretty big chunk of your twenties to surrender to solitary, punishing work, I tell him. \u0022Yeah, I gotta get a break,\u0022 he says, nodding vacantly. \u0022I\u0027m starting to get a little lobotomized.\u0022 There\u0027s fun stuff about it, too, he adds. He\u0027s survived a helicopter crash, narrowly avoided being eaten by bears, and seen countryside few get to see. \u0022But after all the helicopter rides and the mountains and bears, all it is is putting dirt in a bag.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AResident gold skeptic Caveman Bill.\u000A\u000AThe sky leaks steadily. We slog up a peak and down a little saddle. The sodden soil is heavy as slate. Morgan hunches to stuff another brick of dirt into his pack, and when he does, a little kit bag spills out and goes somersaulting off the ridge. Morgan sighs. \u0022That was my lunch.\u0022\u000A\u000AWithin the next five years, every bit of promising ground in the Yukon will likely be mapped. The dirtbaggers will be out of work, and the anonymous hills around Dawson, mineralogically speaking, will be as inscrutable and mysterious as a wiring diagram. The dicey thing here is that it could take many, many years for the mining to get under way, by which point the U.S. economy may have rebounded and the price of gold may have tanked again, thus turning a gold mine into another heap of unviable dirt. A few days later, I mention this to an exploration guy at a hard-rock firm. \u0022Yeah,\u0022 he says. \u0022I guess we\u0027re just all hoping that things in America stay bad.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AWall Street hedging and hard-rock mania aren\u0027t the only forces driving the gold frenzy. There is also a certain camp, captained by presidential hopeful (as of this writing) Dr. Ron Paul, who believes a return to the gold standard would heal our sick economy. Going back to gold would mean a geyser of riches here in the Yukon, yet you don\u0027t find many local miners who bother to fantasize about it. Unless, that is, you talk to the cast of the most popular reality-TV series ever to hit the Yukon: Gold Rush, now taping its second season in the Klondike.\u000A\u000AThe show is ideal narrative balm for our age of woe: Six jobless fellows from Oregon, spearheaded by the father-son team of Jack and Todd Hoffman, risk everything to dig a large hole and become millionaires. That\u0027s how Jack put it to his crew last season: \u0022You\u0027re all millionaires. The only thing is, you gotta get it out of the ground.\u0022 But what they got out of the ground last season—fourteen ounces ($20,000)—didn\u0027t make anyone a millionaire or, after expenses, even a hundredaire. The Discovery Channel, meanwhile, struck the mother lode: The show\u0027s season finale drew 4.5 million viewers.\u000A\u000ASo what\u0027s everybody watching for? \u0022For hope,\u0022 says Todd, a 42-year-old with the long, wiry goatee of speed-metal bassists the world over. \u0022The whole economy is tits. Social Security is tits. I get letters from these frickin\u0027 guys and they\u0027re like, \u0027I was ready to kill myself, and then I watched your show, and it gave me hope.\u0027 I mean, the entrepreneurial spirit that made this country great, it\u0027s dying. What happened? We\u0027re supposed to be like the shining city on the hill, bro. We push the envelope! We run this planet! Let\u0027s give hope to people! If we can do that out here by moving forward this summer, or even by failing, it will have been worth it.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AA chopper drops off the new forty-niners—\u0022dirtbaggers.\u0022\u000A\u000ATodd understands that it\u0027s a tall order to think Gold Rush can single-handedly inspire everybody to get together and make America a shining city on the hill again. What just might is to get \u0022a bunch of conservatives [elected] who\u0027ll talk about getting us back on the gold standard,\u0022 Todd says, kicking back in his RV after a day\u0027s shoot. \u0022It\u0027d save America. It\u0027d make us a world superpower again. Paper currency is nothing; it\u0027s just the promise of something. Precious metal is the only real currency that we have.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s this rather Vaseline-lensed picture that Congressman Ron Paul is currently flogging on the stump. The argument in favor, as Paul has it, is that people have been arbitrarily fond of gold for 6,000 years, and there\u0027s something essentially villainous in letting the Fed \u0022manipulate money.\u0022 Paul\u0027s crusade is recently catching hold among our elected offi;cials. In Utah, Republican state legislators passed a bill ratifying gold and silver as legal tender. Kindred legislation has been introduced in Idaho, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, Washington, and Virginia, where, by way of explanation, state delegate Bob Marshall told voters, \u0022If you look closely on a [dollar] bill, it doesn\u0027t say that it\u0027s money.\u0022\u000A\u000AEven so, you\u0027d have a hard time packing a phone booth with econ Ph.D.\u0027s who think the gold standard isn\u0027t disastrous nonsense. The assortment of plagues a return to gold would inflict on our economy, experts say, is too vast to itemize here, so let\u0027s do something simple. Let\u0027s just imagine for a second where you\u0027d be right now if the dollar were still yoked to gold. If you squint and are drunk, it looks pretty great.\u000A\u000APicture it: In the past decade, gold\u0027s ascendancy would have jacked the dollar up 500 percent compared with, say, the euro. Boosh—slam dunk! Superpower! Face! Though wait, hold on: What if you\u0027re a bright-eyed young entrepreneur who owns a factory that makes, say, bald-eagle flagpole toppers? Your competitor in China, who used to pay the stiffs in his beak-polishing department $6 a day, now gets them for $1 a day. His $60 bootleg of your Thrifty Patriot model now goes for ten bucks. Who wants to pay a 500 percent premium for your bona fide made-in-America eagle? Nobody. Everybody buys them from the Chinese guy. You lay off your employees and file bankruptcy. Your wife ditches you for a comparatively wealthy Zimbabwean roofer. You kill yourself. Everybody kills themselves. America ceases to push the envelope and run this planet.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ASwap out a few details and this is more or less what happened in Britain in the late \u002720s. In 1925, after a hiatus from the gold standard during World War I, Winston Churchill tried to win some international status by going back to gold. The pound\u0027s value shot up. So did the price of British exports. The U.K.\u0027s economy went off a cliff.\u000A\u000AMeanwhile, back in the U.S.A., when panicked depositors made a run on the banks, the Fed, constrained by the gold standard, couldn\u0027t just print more money like in 2008. So the banks failed. People starved in shantytowns. We weren\u0027t a shining city on a hill.\u000A\u000ATo halt future bank panics, FDR outlawed the private ownership of bullion in 1933. The metal had a brief comeback in 1944 when, under the Bretton Woods accord, America agreed to settle accounts with gold. But when the French threatened to cast us into depression by demanding a treasury-rupturing payout of bullion in 1971, Richard Nixon punked them and took us off the gold standard for good.\u000A\u000AHistory and expert consensus notwithstanding, the gold-standard rhetoric is resonating boomingly with the present conservative animus against anything that smacks of government or people with Ph.D.\u0027s. Better to go back to gold, which comes from God and bulldozers and not what John Maynard Keynes called the \u0022apparatus of the mind.\u0022 Sure. Maybe. So let\u0027s ignore the fact that in the post-1930s fiat-money era, the Fed has so far successfully manipulated us away from cataclysms of Depression magnitude. It\u0027s your call, voter: Do we leave control of the money supply in the hands of Bernanke and his big-government elites, or do we turn it over to some people whose main thing is washing dirt?\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000ATo my surprise, not everyone in Dawson City is scrambling for a jackpot in the Nielsens or the hills. One morning I meet a rare human being who wants nothing more from the gold rush than what he\u0027s already got. His name is Caveman Bill, and hard-rock mining made his house, a comfy hole in a cliff across the Yukon River from Dawson. Bill, whose last name is Donaldson (a piece of trivia few people in Dawson City know), has spent fifteen years in the cave, and he speaks with some reverence about the builder and architect. \u0022Back then [1920], everyone else was doing placer gold, but this guy—his name was Johannes Andresson—he stakes hard rock and started chipping away by himself. He\u0027d never say shit to anyone about what he was doing, but every month he\u0027d come to town and buy all his supplies with hard-rock gold. So the rumors started going rampant that he\u0027d struck the mother lode over here.\u0022\u000A\u000ABill has tried a casual hand at mining and panning, but the fever never took. He remains bearish on the rumored hard-rock mother lodes. \u0022By the time they put one shovel in the ground for actual mining, the price of gold will have probably gone tits up. But still, gold makes people fucking stupid, so everybody\u0027s speculating and jacking the stock price up, and they\u0027ll probably lose their shirt,\u0022 Bill says.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMining scars in the Yukon, both ugly...\u000A\u000ALooking around Bill\u0027s cave, one gets the impression of a man committed exclusively to investments he can touch and use and smell. He has a laptop computer he runs off a solar panel, and some beautiful handmade cabinets busy with chiseled details and dovetail joints cut without the use of power tools. Salvage is big in Caveman\u0027s portfolio. The windows in his cave front were pried from oven doors. (\u0022Insulated, double-paned—why not?\u0022) His front yard is dangerous with scrap wood and metal.\u000A\u000A\u0022Anyway, I\u0027ve got all sorts of shit back here,\u0022 he says. \u0022Hey, check this out.\u0022 He hands me a jar filled with frosty white matter. \u0022Piss crystals.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s what?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022For making homemade explosives. You can smell it if you want.\u0022\u000A\u000AI say that won\u0027t be necessary.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027d been trying this recipe for gunpowder that used chickenshit tea, but it wasn\u0027t working out for me. I wasn\u0027t getting a good niter [potassium nitrate, a key ingredient in gunpowder]. Then I noticed in my piss jug, when I hadn\u0027t dumped it in a while, that I was getting this crystal formation. So I started collecting it.… It\u0027s ammonium nitrate, what fertilizer bombers use.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022So what are you going to blow up?\u0022\u000A\u000ACaveman Bill scratches at his beard, a less uptight version of the sort Ted Kaczynski used to wear. \u0022I haven\u0027t decided yet.\u0022\u000A\u000ABack indoors, Bill says, \u0022But I never finished telling you about the guy who built this place. Anyway, he was here a year and a half, with everybody thinking he\u0027d hit the mother lode. And just before the last boat left for the season, he put the place up for sale. He got eleven grand for it. The price of gold was twenty bucks an ounce in those days. The next day, he was gone. The new owners came over, and this is what they found.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe rubs a finger over a scintillant gleam in his ceiling.\u000A\u000A\u0022Wait, is that—\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Fool\u0027s gold,\u0022 says Caveman Bill, snickering musically.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AAfter nearly two weeks in the Yukon, I have yet to set foot in an actual mine. It turns out, asking a miner to let you poke around his operation is a little like soliciting a stranger for a copy of his latest bank statement. But finally, after propositioning every Yukoner faintly redolent of diesel fuel, I\u0027m invited to spend a night at a working mine, operated by Simon and Lil Hambrook, a resoundingly genial husband-and-wife team in their forties.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s pushing midnight by the time I arrive, and in the undying subarctic sunlight, work is going smoothly. In the Yukon, water naturally stays liquid for only about 120 days a year. For a small operation like Simon and Lil\u0027s, you have to spend close to every hour of those 120 days tirelessly rinsing gravel.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A...and eerily beautiful.\u000A\u000ABefore striking out on their own, Lil, an etcher-lithographer, worked as an administrator at arts institutes. Simon spent six years working for other placer miners, saving his money for his own equipment fleet, which he bought at auctions, piece by piece. The ground they\u0027re working now is lean,\u000A\u000ALil tells me, so lean that the miner who worked it before them lost a fortune of many millions before giving up. But thanks to the spiraling price of gold and the Hambrooks\u0027 eye toward effi;ciency, they\u0027re making quite an adequate living. This season they\u0027re hoping for somewhere in the neighborhood of 800 ounces. At today\u0027s price, that would fetch over $1.4 million, a sum that seems a little less pulse-quickening once you consider the host of overhead termites that get to nibble at it before Lil and Simon get paid. Off the top, a royalty of 10 percent goes to the claim owner. And there\u0027s food, tas, and payroll. And then, of course, there are the breathtaking diesel bills, $25,000 every few weeks, and the ludicrous cost of maintaining heavy equipment.\u000A\u000A\u0022Anytime you have an equipment breakdown, it\u0027s thirty or forty thousand bucks. It\u0027s like building a house—every day—cha-ching, cha-ching,\u0022 she says. Lil goes on to articulate another reason you wouldn\u0027t want to put her and Simon on Gold Rush: When it comes to gold, they are calculated and pragmatic, not delightfully insane. \u0022A lot of guys lose fortunes at this because with gold, people get stupid. They don\u0027t see it for what it is. They see Agamemnon\u0027s mask,\u0022 she says. \u0022The trick is, you can\u0027t chase it. Every day, you look at how much fuel you\u0027ve used and how much gold you have, and if it\u0027s not good enough, you get out.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat compensates for the work\u0027s uncertainty, outlandish overhead, and tedium of spending all day, all summer long, washing dirt is that it\u0027s entirely free of the interpersonal maneuvering that running a multimillion-dollar business typically demands. \u0022You don\u0027t have to go to meetings or pitch sales deals to people. The gold\u0027s there or it\u0027s not,\u0022 says Simon. \u0022When it is, it\u0027s quite neat to be making money out of nothing.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe process of mining placer gold is absurdly simple. With the heaviest-duty bulldozers and excavators you can afford, you scrape aside the permafrost and dig down to the bedrock, where the gold has settled over the years. Then you feed the pay dirt into the wash plant, basically a diesel-driven colander the size of a brontosaurus, which rinses and excretes boulders, rocks, and gravel above half an inch in diameter (known as tailings), reserving the gold-rich soils.\u000A\u000AIn the morning, I join Simon at the mine, where, in breach of his industry\u0027s customary secrecy, he lets me watch his daily cleanup—the process of rinsing the gold from the fine soils culled from the wash plant\u0027s trap. To collect the pure gold, Simon runs soils through a sluice, a sloping metal trough lined with a plastic woolly material overlaid with a mesh of what looks like cyclone fencing. Simon dumps shovelfuls of black dirt from a bathtub-sized hopper into the water coursing down the spillway. The current carries off the dirt while the gold, which is nineteen times heavier than water, settles out. Before long, a sparse yellow delta begins coalescing in the riffles. Okay. Gold. Nothing to freak out over. It looks like a scattering of nutritional yeast.\u000A\u000AI keep fairly cool until Simon very casually puts a nugget into my fingers. It isn\u0027t much to look at, really, a bright little booger-sized chunklet no heftier than the crumpled foil wrapper from a Hershey\u0027s kiss. No big deal. Yet something is happening. My pulse hikes up a notch. Somewhere at the back of my mind a voice starts going OH GOD, OH GOD! RICHES! BULLION! ALADDIN\u0027S CAVE! I\u0027M HOLDING SOME ACTUAL GOLD! Not to get too Californian on you, but some energy is definitely vibing off this thing. Until now the idea of holding gold as an investment or otherwise hasn\u0027t offered the faintest allure, but now I am tuning something in, an unheard, insistent bleating that says, \u0022Gather up a bunch of me and you will be safe from a bad and uncertain world.\u0022\u000A\u000A I stare at it for a good while, trying to decipher this idiotic sensation. But it\u0027s no more decipherable than the experience of seeing the Mona Lisa or spotting Tom Cruise in line at the Dairy Queen—the sensation, that is, of standing in the presence of something pregnant with fathomless value for reasons no one really understands. That\u0027s as articulate as I can be about what it\u0027s like to hold Simon\u0027s nugget. It\u0027s like holding a booger-sized Tom Cruise.\u000A\u000ASimon, though, isn\u0027t freaking at all. \u0022It\u0027s nice on a sunny day when you look down and see a hundred and fifty ounces gleaming in the sun,\u0022 he says. \u0022This isn\u0027t one of those days.\u0022 Still, it\u0027s maybe thirty or thirty-five ounces lying there. And I sort of stammer that it\u0027s nothing to sneeze at, forty or fifty grand wrung from the humble dirt. \u0022It seems like quite a bit, I guess, but then I just paid a fuel bill for $35,000,\u0022 Simon remarks.\u000A\u000AAnd looking behind him, at the vast heap of earth he had to move—165 tons per ounce of gold—it does suddenly seem like an utterly mad amount of work for a quantity of material that could fit into the front pocket of a pair of tight jeans. \u0022It\u0027s retarded, isn\u0027t it?\u0022 says Simon. \u0022The government should pay you not to do it.\u0022",

Dawson, which lies at the scenic crotch of the Klondike and Yukon rivers in Canada&apos;s Yukon Territory, sprang up in 1896 during the Klondike Stampede, and a century after the first gold rush petered out, the latest global gold mania is again rippling village life in this town of 1,800. When I visit in the summer of 2011, with the price of gold at record highs, the very dirt under the city has become controversially precious. One prospector is pissing people off by trying to mine a local road. Rumor has it owners of the Westminster Hotel got into trouble for sinking a shaft under the saloon. By law, you can&apos;t start your own gold mine within city limits, though according to scuttlebutt, a few local householders are furtively mining their basements.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.2">It&apos;s boom times in Dawson for a simple reason: Gold loves bad news. When the economy slumps, lots of people suddenly wake up to the frightening, psychedelic truth that our entire financial system rests on the internationally abetted illusion that government-issued pieces of green paper have intrinsic value. To safeguard their riches against inflation or, as some have it, the collapse of Western civilization, these people buy large quantities of a soft yellow mineral that also has no intrinsic value. So do daisy chains of speculators, and the price of gold goes up and up and up.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.3">So now, with gold at 500 percent of its price pre&#x2013;September 11, speculators and mother-lode seekers are pouring back into the hills and valleys around Dawson. A local aphorism estimates that out of every hundred miners to stake a claim, ninety-nine will lose their shirts. Still, fifty new gold-exploration companies have hit town in recent years. And claims have skyrocketed from 28,000 in 2009 to 80,000 in 2011. All of which is trailing the symptoms of an economy in overdrive. Unemployment is approximately zero. Monthly rents aren&apos;t much cheaper than Brooklyn&apos;s. In the grocery store on Front Street, a case of Aquafina water sells for $32.99, plus deposit.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.5">The bulk of the action isn&apos;t in Dawson but in the far-flung boondocks. And the throngs of gold tourists&#x2014;expecting toothless coots jigging down Front Street with fistfuls of nuggets&#x2014;aren&apos;t quite sure what to do with themselves other than wander the clapboard village painted in merry hues. On a cursory prowl my first night, the only identifiable mania is happening over at the Sourdough Saloon, where a mob is clamoring to drink the house specialty, a shot of liquor garnished with a human toe.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.6">The toe cocktail dates from the 1970s. The first toe belonged to a frostbite victim, but somebody swallowed that one. In years since, open calls for toe donations have been answered by sufferers of diabetes, frostbite, lawn-mowing accidents, and a woman with an inoperable corn.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.7"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fba93655c24c6c954b80/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-01.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-01.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fba93655c24c6c954b80%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-01.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fba93655c24c6c954b80%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-01.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.8">Dawson&apos;s Disneyish downtown has new visitors: gold tourists.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.9">Tourist hokery aside, the toe, a big one, is authentically revolting. It looks like a rotten prune shingled with a sulfur-colored toenail. An unappetizing bit of bone peeks from the knuckle. The shaft bit looks a little beat up, slightly gnawed. When the guy ahead of me takes his turn, I see how it got that way. According to rules of the rite, you&apos;re supposed to let the toe at least bang against your lips, but this guy&#x2014;rising to a moment in the spotlight&#x2014; takes it into his mouth and chews it before spitting it back into the glass.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.a">Why does anyone do this? I put the question to a Quebecois college kid queued with some pals behind me. &quot;There&apos;s supposed to be a gold rush, but you can&apos;t see it,&quot; he reflects. &quot;So we came here to drink the toe. The toe you can see.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.b">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.c">If you actually want to see the gold rush, you have to catch a helicopter to a ridge in the bush about fifty trailless miles from Dawson. When I arrive, I find five guys from an exploration company who have been camped here since June. Everyone is hairy. The smell about them is strong but wholesome. Not unwashed homeless so much as unwashed elk, a natural musk.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.d">The land here makes your jaw hang open. Peaks and ridges arrayed in an unending motley dentition so vast that, if they have names, nobody knows what they are. Some are gray and jagged as broken bones. Others are zaftig and green and seem to want golfers. Late snow gleams in a few drainages, bright as a fuse. Mosquitoes with denim-piercing lances swarm. Still, not a bad place to clock in every day, I observe to a short, bearded fellow whose name I don&apos;t catch. &quot;This is the best and worst job I&apos;ve ever had,&quot; he replies. &quot;You get to jump out of helicopters and walk hills nobody&apos;s ever walked on before. But most mornings you&apos;re like, fuck, I&apos;ve gotta climb a mountain in the pouring rain.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.e">Dawson&apos;s current gold rush doesn&apos;t much resemble the mad scramble of 1896. Those old-timers were sluicing &quot;placer&quot; (pronounced &quot;plasser&quot;) gold, little flakes and nuggets that fetch up in creek gravel, the same stuff that now sustains about 140 mostly mom-and-pop operations, territory-wide. The current mania is a search for hard-rock gold, the slowly eroding source of all the placer flakelets. The chancy thing with hard-rock gold is that it&apos;s buried deep in the bedrock and therefore requires mountain-pureeing technology (and massive corporate capitalization) to recover, but local geologists speculate that the Yukon&apos;s hard-rock claims could yield a million ounces or more.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.f">At the movement&apos;s vanguard is a guy named Shawn Ryan. Back in the 1990s, when the price of gold was limping along between $250 and $400 an ounce, nobody except Ryan saw the point in bushwhacking remote hills in search of gold not worth the money it would cost to dig up. Ryan made a careful study of aerial-magnetic-imaging surveys of the mountains around Dawson, looking for the mineralogical symptoms of gold. When he could scrape the money together, he&apos;d go out and stake claims. In the laissez-faire law of the Yukon, anybody can drive a pair of stakes into a spot of ground and, for a $10 fee, secure the mineral rights to a fifty-two-acre plot. Ryan currently holds over 45,000 claims, spanning more square mileage than Delaware. So far his efforts haven&apos;t yielded enough gold to gild a toothpick, yet Ryan himself, formerly scraping by as a freelance mushroom gatherer, has leased his claims to an exploration company (he&apos;s now its president) and is worth at least $15 million.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.g"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fba909f0bee56440c157/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-02.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fba909f0bee56440c157%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-02.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fba909f0bee56440c157%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-02.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.h">A day&apos;s wages at a mom-and-pop mine.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.i">The mission of the one-hundred-plus hard-rock operations out here this summer isn&apos;t to mine the ground themselves but to grab as much land as possible and flip it once more to an even larger international mining company. But a multinational conglomerate like Kinross isn&apos;t going to cut you a check just because you&apos;ve got some ground. The sales pitch requires assay results from rock and soil samples, tons of them. So the big hard-rock stampede right now doesn&apos;t look like people striking it rich. It looks like hundreds of mostly young men humping the nameless boonies, putting dirt in plastic bags.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.j">I&apos;m spending the day tailing Morgan Fraughton, sergeant of this particular dirtbagging platoon. His work is this: Every day, the chopper deposits him on a spot of often harsh terrain. Then he takes a seven-hour walk, bending over every 165 feet to fill a bag with dirt. &quot;It can be pretty miserable,&quot; he says. &quot;But just surviving it, you feel like a man, like you&apos;re in this battle with yourself and winning.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.k">On the ridge, he checks the GPS, unholsters his soil auger&#x2014;an oversize T-handled tool whose business end is the helically twisted eye of an oversize embroidery needle. With an effortful crunch, he wrenches it into the ground and pulls out a leaden parfait of earth. The sample is a good one, eroded bedrock. If there&apos;s any gold in there, it&apos;s present in some small number of parts per billion, invisible to the naked eye. &quot;A great sample, easy to get to. This is really awesome dirt,&quot; Morgan says.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.l">Morgan&apos;s been doing this for three years&#x2014;a pretty big chunk of your twenties to surrender to solitary, punishing work, I tell him. &quot;Yeah, I gotta get a break,&quot; he says, nodding vacantly. &quot;I&apos;m starting to get a little lobotomized.&quot; There&apos;s fun stuff about it, too, he adds. He&apos;s survived a helicopter crash, narrowly avoided being eaten by bears, and seen countryside few get to see. &quot;But after all the helicopter rides and the mountains and bears, all it is is putting dirt in a bag.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.m"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fbaa3655c24c6c954b92/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-03.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaa3655c24c6c954b92%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-03.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaa3655c24c6c954b92%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-03.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.n">Resident gold skeptic Caveman Bill.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.o">The sky leaks steadily.

Morgan sighs. &quot;That was my lunch.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.p">Within the next five years, every bit of promising ground in the Yukon will likely be mapped. The dirtbaggers will be out of work, and the anonymous hills around Dawson, mineralogically speaking, will be as inscrutable and mysterious as a wiring diagram. The dicey thing here is that it could take many, many years for the mining to get under way, by which point the U.S. economy may have rebounded and the price of gold may have tanked again, thus turning a gold mine into another heap of unviable dirt. A few days later, I mention this to an exploration guy at a hard-rock firm. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;I guess we&apos;re just all hoping that things in America stay bad.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.q">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.r">Wall Street hedging and hard-rock mania aren&apos;t the only forces driving the gold frenzy. There is also a certain camp, captained by presidential hopeful (as of this writing) Dr. Ron Paul, who believes a return to the gold standard would heal our sick economy. Going back to gold would mean a geyser of riches here in the Yukon, yet you don&apos;t find many local miners who bother to fantasize about it. Unless, that is, you talk to the cast of the most popular reality-TV series ever to hit the Yukon: <em>Gold Rush</em>, now taping its second season in the Klondike.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.s">The show is ideal narrative balm for our age of woe: Six jobless fellows from Oregon, spearheaded by the father-son team of Jack and Todd Hoffman, risk everything to dig a large hole and become millionaires. That&apos;s how Jack put it to his crew last season: &quot;You&apos;re all millionaires. The only thing is, you gotta get it out of the ground.&quot; But what they got out of the ground last season&#x2014;fourteen ounces ($20,000)&#x2014;didn&apos;t make anyone a millionaire or, after expenses, even a hundredaire. The Discovery Channel, meanwhile, struck the mother lode: The show&apos;s season finale drew 4.5 million viewers.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.t">So what&apos;s everybody watching for? &quot;For hope,&quot; says Todd, a 42-year-old with the long, wiry goatee of speed-metal bassists the world over. &quot;The whole economy is tits. Social Security is tits. I get letters from these frickin&apos; guys and they&apos;re like, &apos;I was ready to kill myself, and then I watched your show, and it gave me hope.&apos; I mean, the entrepreneurial spirit that made this country great, it&apos;s dying.

The argument in favor, as Paul has it, is that people have been arbitrarily fond of gold for 6,000 years, and there&apos;s something essentially villainous in letting the Fed &quot;manipulate money.&quot; Paul&apos;s crusade is recently catching hold among our elected offi;cials. In Utah, Republican state legislators passed a bill ratifying gold and silver as legal tender. Kindred legislation has been introduced in Idaho, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, Washington, and Virginia, where, by way of explanation, state delegate Bob Marshall told voters, &quot;If you look closely on a [dollar] bill, it doesn&apos;t say that it&apos;s money.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.y">Even so, you&apos;d have a hard time packing a phone booth with econ Ph.D.&apos;s who think the gold standard isn&apos;t disastrous nonsense.

Let&apos;s just imagine for a second where you&apos;d be right now if the dollar were still yoked to gold. If you squint and are drunk, it looks pretty great.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.z">Picture it: In the past decade, gold&apos;s ascendancy would have jacked the dollar up 500 percent compared with, say, the euro.

Your competitor in China, who used to pay the stiffs in his beak-polishing department $6 a day, now gets them for $1 a day. His $60 bootleg of your Thrifty Patriot model now goes for ten bucks. Who wants to pay a 500 percent premium for your bona fide made-in-America eagle? Nobody. Everybody buys them from the Chinese guy. You lay off your employees and file bankruptcy.

In 1925, after a hiatus from the gold standard during World War I, Winston Churchill tried to win some international status by going back to gold. The pound&apos;s value shot up. So did the price of British exports. The U.K.&apos;s economy went off a cliff.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.12">Meanwhile, back in the U.S.A., when panicked depositors made a run on the banks, the Fed, constrained by the gold standard, couldn&apos;t just print more money like in 2008. So the banks failed. People starved in shantytowns. We weren&apos;t a shining city on a hill.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.13">To halt future bank panics, FDR outlawed the private ownership of bullion in 1933. The metal had a brief comeback in 1944 when, under the Bretton Woods accord, America agreed to settle accounts with gold. But when the French threatened to cast us into depression by demanding a treasury-rupturing payout of bullion in 1971, Richard Nixon punked them and took us off the gold standard for good.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.14">History and expert consensus notwithstanding, the gold-standard rhetoric is resonating boomingly with the present conservative animus against anything that smacks of government or people with Ph.D.&apos;s. Better to go back to gold, which comes from God and bulldozers and not what John Maynard Keynes called the &quot;apparatus of the mind.&quot; Sure. Maybe. So let&apos;s ignore the fact that in the post-1930s fiat-money era, the Fed has so far successfully manipulated us away from cataclysms of Depression magnitude. It&apos;s your call, voter: Do we leave control of the money supply in the hands of Bernanke and his big-government elites, or do we turn it over to some people whose main thing is washing dirt?</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.15">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.16">To my surprise, not everyone in Dawson City is scrambling for a jackpot in the Nielsens or the hills. One morning I meet a rare human being who wants nothing more from the gold rush than what he&apos;s already got. His name is Caveman Bill, and hard-rock mining made his house, a comfy hole in a cliff across the Yukon River from Dawson. Bill, whose last name is Donaldson (a piece of trivia few people in Dawson City know), has spent fifteen years in the cave, and he speaks with some reverence about the builder and architect. &quot;Back then [1920], everyone else was doing placer gold, but this guy&#x2014;his name was Johannes Andresson&#x2014;he stakes hard rock and started chipping away by himself. He&apos;d never say shit to anyone about what he was doing, but every month he&apos;d come to town and buy all his supplies with hard-rock gold. So the rumors started going rampant that he&apos;d struck the mother lode over here.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.17">Bill has tried a casual hand at mining and panning, but the fever never took. He remains bearish on the rumored hard-rock mother lodes. &quot;By the time they put one shovel in the ground for actual mining, the price of gold will have probably gone tits up. But still, gold makes people fucking stupid, so everybody&apos;s speculating and jacking the stock price up, and they&apos;ll probably lose their shirt,&quot; Bill says.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.18"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fbaa3655c24c6c954b8c/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-05.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-05.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaa3655c24c6c954b8c%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-05.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fgold-standard-ron-paul-gold-rush-klondike&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbaa3655c24c6c954b8c%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-05.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-01-gold-gold-inset-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.19">Mining scars in the Yukon, both ugly...</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.1a">Looking around Bill&apos;s cave, one gets the impression of a man committed exclusively to investments he can touch and use and smell. He has a laptop computer he runs off a solar panel, and some beautiful handmade cabinets busy with chiseled details and dovetail joints cut without the use of power tools. Salvage is big in Caveman&apos;s portfolio. The windows in his cave front were pried from oven doors.

Anyway, he was here a year and a half, with everybody thinking he&apos;d hit the mother lode. And just before the last boat left for the season, he put the place up for sale. He got eleven grand for it. The price of gold was twenty bucks an ounce in those days. The next day, he was gone.

It turns out, asking a miner to let you poke around his operation is a little like soliciting a stranger for a copy of his latest bank statement. But finally, after propositioning every Yukoner faintly redolent of diesel fuel, I&apos;m invited to spend a night at a working mine, operated by Simon and Lil Hambrook, a resoundingly genial husband-and-wife team in their forties.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.1o">It&apos;s pushing midnight by the time I arrive, and in the undying subarctic sunlight, work is going smoothly.

Simon spent six years working for other placer miners, saving his money for his own equipment fleet, which he bought at auctions, piece by piece. The ground they&apos;re working now is lean,</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.1s">Lil tells me, so lean that the miner who worked it before them lost a fortune of many millions before giving up. But thanks to the spiraling price of gold and the Hambrooks&apos; eye toward effi;ciency, they&apos;re making quite an adequate living. This season they&apos;re hoping for somewhere in the neighborhood of 800 ounces. At today&apos;s price, that would fetch over $1.4 million, a sum that seems a little less pulse-quickening once you consider the host of overhead termites that get to nibble at it before Lil and Simon get paid. Off the top, a royalty of 10 percent goes to the claim owner. And there&apos;s food, tas, and payroll. And then, of course, there are the breathtaking diesel bills, $25,000 every few weeks, and the ludicrous cost of maintaining heavy equipment.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.1t">&quot;Anytime you have an equipment breakdown, it&apos;s thirty or forty thousand bucks. It&apos;s like building a house&#x2014;every day&#x2014;<em>cha-ching, cha-ching</em>,&quot; she says. Lil goes on to articulate another reason you wouldn&apos;t want to put her and Simon on <em>Gold Rush</em>: When it comes to gold, they are calculated and pragmatic, not delightfully insane. &quot;A lot of guys lose fortunes at this because with gold, people get stupid. They don&apos;t see it for what it is. They see Agamemnon&apos;s mask,&quot; she says. &quot;The trick is, you can&apos;t chase it. Every day, you look at how much fuel you&apos;ve used and how much gold you have, and if it&apos;s not good enough, you get out.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.1u">What compensates for the work&apos;s uncertainty, outlandish overhead, and tedium of spending all day, all summer long, washing dirt is that it&apos;s entirely free of the interpersonal maneuvering that running a multimillion-dollar business typically demands. &quot;You don&apos;t have to go to meetings or pitch sales deals to people. The gold&apos;s there or it&apos;s not,&quot; says Simon. &quot;When it is, it&apos;s quite neat to be making money out of nothing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.1v">The process of mining placer gold is absurdly simple. With the heaviest-duty bulldozers and excavators you can afford, you scrape aside the permafrost and dig down to the bedrock, where the gold has settled over the years. Then you feed the pay dirt into the wash plant, basically a diesel-driven colander the size of a brontosaurus, which rinses and excretes boulders, rocks, and gravel above half an inch in diameter (known as tailings), reserving the gold-rich soils.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.1w">In the morning, I join Simon at the mine, where, in breach of his industry&apos;s customary secrecy, he lets me watch his daily cleanup&#x2014;the process of rinsing the gold from the fine soils culled from the wash plant&apos;s trap. To collect the pure gold, Simon runs soils through a sluice, a sloping metal trough lined with a plastic woolly material overlaid with a mesh of what looks like cyclone fencing. Simon dumps shovelfuls of black dirt from a bathtub-sized hopper into the water coursing down the spillway. The current carries off the dirt while the gold, which is nineteen times heavier than water, settles out. Before long, a sparse yellow delta begins coalescing in the riffles. Okay. Gold. Nothing to freak out over. It looks like a scattering of nutritional yeast.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.1x">I keep fairly cool until Simon very casually puts a nugget into my fingers. It isn&apos;t much to look at, really, a bright little booger-sized chunklet no heftier than the crumpled foil wrapper from a Hershey&apos;s kiss. No big deal. Yet something is happening. My pulse hikes up a notch. Somewhere at the back of my mind a voice starts going OH GOD, OH GOD! RICHES! BULLION! ALADDIN&apos;S CAVE! I&apos;M HOLDING SOME ACTUAL GOLD! Not to get too Californian on you, but some <em>energy</em> is definitely vibing off this thing. Until now the idea of holding gold as an investment or otherwise hasn&apos;t offered the faintest allure, but now I am tuning something in, an unheard, insistent bleating that says, &quot;Gather up a bunch of me and you will be safe from a bad and uncertain world.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.1y"> I stare at it for a good while, trying to decipher this idiotic sensation. But it&apos;s no more decipherable than the experience of seeing the<em> Mona Lisa </em>or spotting Tom Cruise in line at the Dairy Queen&#x2014;the sensation, that is, of standing in the presence of something pregnant with fathomless value for reasons no one really understands. That&apos;s as articulate as I can be about what it&apos;s like to hold Simon&apos;s nugget. It&apos;s like holding a booger-sized Tom Cruise.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.1z">Simon, though, isn&apos;t freaking at all. &quot;It&apos;s nice on a sunny day when you look down and see a hundred and fifty ounces gleaming in the sun,&quot; he says. &quot;This isn&apos;t one of those days.&quot; Still, it&apos;s maybe thirty or thirty-five ounces lying there. And I sort of stammer that it&apos;s nothing to sneeze at, forty or fifty grand wrung from the humble dirt. &quot;It seems like quite a bit, I guess, but then I just paid a fuel bill for $35,000,&quot; Simon remarks.</p><p data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.4.20">And looking behind him, at the vast heap of earth he had to move&#x2014;165 tons per ounce of gold&#x2014;it does suddenly seem like an utterly mad amount of work for a quantity of material that could fit into the front pocket of a pair of tight jeans. &quot;It&apos;s retarded, isn&apos;t it?&quot; says Simon. &quot;The government should pay you not to do it.&quot;</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".3ehnch8c1s.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
