  	    "articleBody": "There\u0027s a hook-in-cheek passage in Ed Caesar\u0027s new book, Two Hours, that articulates the first glimpse—by British mountaineer George Mallory, in 1921—of the summit of Mt. Everest. Mallory would disappear on an expedition in 1924, and Edmund Hillary wouldn\u0027t achieve full-scaling for another three decades, but this observation by Mallory vivifies the sense of being on the verge of something impossible without yet achieving it—gazing at this thing and knowing it can be conquered but not knowing quite how or when or who:\u000A\u000A\u0022Mountain shapes are often fantastic seen through a mist, these were\u000Alike the wildest creation of a dream. A preposterous triangular lump\u000Arose out of the depths; its edge came leaping up at an angle of about\u000A70 degrees and ended nowhere. To the left a black serrated crest was\u000Ahanging in the sky incredibly. Gradually, very gradually, we saw the\u000Agreat mountain sides and glaciers and arêtes, now one fragment and now\u000Aanother through the floating rifts, until far higher in the sky than\u000Aimagination had dared to suggest the white summit of Everest appeared.\u000AAnd in the series of partial glimpses we had seen a whole; we were\u000Aable to piece together the fragments to interpret the dream.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn the book, Everest is deployed as a useful analogue for the two-hour marathon mark—a barrier that has long seemed insurmountable (and that also lends its elegant simplicity to the title). Marathons have, as Caesar reminds us, a tremendous 2,500-year-old origin story: \u0022There is no better creation myth in sports.\u0022 And there\u0027s plenty in this excellent (super-smooth, elite-marathon-runner-paced) debut of a book from an excellent young British journalist to contextualize that origin (the supposed 26-ish-mile run by Pheidippides from the battlefield of Marathon, Greece, to Athens), history, and the current conditions of competition among, typically, a group of runners from the narrowest sliver of the earth, the Rift Valley of Kenya. Two Hours is something of a twin narrative—the story of one of those runners and his compatriots, who each year are extruded into the wider world for at least a couple of the marathon majors (New York, Boston, Berlin, London); and the story of science and sport\u0027s obsession with that arbitrary, round mark, the breaking of two hours many believe to be possible (the record is currently 2:02:57), if not imminent.\u000A\u000ACaesar, who\u0027s in town for the American launch of his book and this weekend\u0027s New York City marathon, helped us stoke the marathon flames with something of a viewing guide for Sunday\u0027s race:\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe book has a pretty emphatic answer to this question, but I\u0027ll ask it straight: Will the two-hour mark ever be broken at New York?You\u0027d never ever get a world record at New York. There\u0027s just too much up and down in New York. There are bridges that are actually kind of steep. There are no pacemakers, so the athletes do all the pacing themselves. So it doesn\u0027t always mean slower times, but it quite often means slower times. Unlike some courses, it\u0027s not straightforward, it\u0027s not smooth sailing. There\u0027s sharp corners to negotiate. You know, Bill Rodgers, when he ran the first five-borough [New York City marathon] in 1976, came in at 2:10—but he said it was like urban cross-country, the New York course, which is not a bad description of what it is. [The current record is 2:05:06.]\u000A\u000ASet the table for Sunday\u0027s race. Who are our top contenders? How have they fared this year? How will they spend their week?So the big favorite for this year would be Wilson Kipsang, who won New York last year in an incredible race, and he\u0027s won London twice. He\u0027s the former world-record holder, and he\u0027d have arrived a few days ago. He\u0027d check into the hotel and basically on every day have another media or sponsored engagement. On Tuesday or Wednesday, he\u0027d probably get the kinks out of his legs, do quite a bit of running, go out to Tavern on the Green and see the finishing line. But I don\u0027t think he\u0027d walk the course.\u000A\u000AI remember Geoffrey Mutai [the main character of Two Hours] telling me about before he first ran Boston. He arrived on the Tuesday before the Monday race, which everyone thought was a little early, but he wanted to make sure that he was familiar with the course, and so he took a taxi with his manager from the start to the finish, and he got to the end and he asked the guy, who\u0027d run it the year before, who set the course record, he says, \u0022How did you run 2:05 on that?\u0022 You know, he\u0027s like, been in a taxi, he\u0027s like, \u0022It\u0027s ridiculous,\u0022 and then the following Monday Geoffrey went out and ran 2:03:02.\u000A\u000ABut my feeling is Kipsang is not gonna go and, you know, look at it again. He\u0027ll probably sleep quite a lot. He\u0027ll take it as easy as he can. But it\u0027s quite a cool atmosphere in the hotel in the week leading up to the marathon because all the top guys are staying there, and there\u0027ll be a little debate bubbling around how fast it\u0027s gonna be this year—splits and possible times for this year and who\u0027s in shape and who\u0027s not in shape and so on.\u000A\u000ASo Kipsang as a favorite. Who are you watching?Well, I would say that in my head, there\u0027s a young kid called Geoffrey Kipsang Kamworor [no relation to Wilson], who is an astonishing athlete, but he\u0027s never quite done it at the marathon business. So he\u0027s still in his early twenties. He\u0027s the world half-marathon champion. He\u0027s the world cross-country champion. He got the silver medal at the Worlds in the 10,000 meters behind Mo Farah in Beijing this summer, but every time he\u0027s gone out in a marathon, he\u0027s been in contention until about three miles from the end, and he just hasn\u0027t had the endurance. Everything that I hear from Kenya is that the guy\u0027s in shape now. With all that speed, he\u0027s gonna be able to hold on for the final miles. So it\u0027ll be pretty interesting. So how he goes up against Kipsang, who\u0027s a beautiful runner to watch. Kamworor looks like a bull tilting at a matador. He runs with a kind of shoulder tucked in as he goes around corners. And the first time I ever saw him train was at a place in Kenya, a dust track. And because of his style, because he\u0027s got quite strong shoulders for a marathon runner, and because he\u0027s got a very determined face, and because he tucks his shoulder in, and there were these puffs of dust coming out from behind him when he was running. And he did look so much like a bull.\u000A\u000AIf someone has a chance to watch in person this weekend, what\u0027s the approach?There\u0027s something to be said for being at the course. Just watching them go past a couple of times is pretty incredible. There\u0027s a way to do it in New York—because the course is actually quite conducive to watching in two or three different places—where you can catch them in Brooklyn and then catch them coming up First Avenue and then maybe catch them coming down Fifth Avenue at the end, just before they go into the park, which is normally where the real action is.\u000A\u000AAnd what about at home?The real marathon-heads tend to watch the TV coverage while also reading one or two live feeds. LetsRun—a big running website in the U.S.—they do a really good live blog, so you can kind of toggle between the written coverage and the glimpses that you get on TV.\u000A\u000AWhy can\u0027t I just turn on my TV?In general American TV coverage of marathons is not all about the elites. They quite often spend three or four minutes watching the top men and women. And then they\u0027ll spend 15 minutes looking at the guy dressed as a banana, who\u0027s gonna run four hours. So you might want to get a live stream.\u000A\u000ASo if not a two-hour record this weekend, how do you see it finally falling?My big caveat is that, first of all, people that make predictions about stuff tend to end up looking pretty stupid. And there is a long line of very clever people who have been made to look extremely stupid by what has actually turned out to be, in the case in sports and in all kinds of arenas where you try to predict when stuff\u0027s gonna happen. Having said that, I do generally think we are getting closer, and it might not be too long before we see the two-hour marathon, because I think the sport might change a little bit to prioritize time trials.\u000A\u000ATell me about the time trials.So at the moment the world\u0027s best marathon runners run two marathons a year, and they generally run them in a big city like Boston or New York or London or Berlin. And so it\u0027s not possible to break a world record on all of those courses—marathon courses are different, and generally the world record is broken in Berlin because it\u0027s the fastest. It\u0027s flat, set up for fast times, you have really good pacemakers, et cetera. The weather\u0027s normally perfect. So you know only two or three athletes at any one time, top athletes can run in Berlin, so there really aren\u0027t a lot of opportunities to break the world record. So as the world record gets toward two hours, I think what you might see is specialist time trials that are kind of outside the city marathon, where people will be paid to run on a specialist track of maybe six or eight miles. A marathon in specialist conditions, with the aim being like: Can we get it past two hours? And I think that could happen. I think the shoe companies would be interested in that.\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s mention of that in the book—someone or some company putting up the money as an incentive. The way mathematicians have million-dollar prizes.I could see it happening. I could see it being a big TV event. I could also see why it would suit a lot of people for that to happen. I could see why Adidas would want it to happen. You know, if they\u0027ve got a group of guys all wearing their shoes, trying to break the two-hour marathon, can you imagine a better advert for their sports? So I just think it\u0027s gonna be a little while before we get there. I think people will chip away at the world record as they\u0027re doing right now, in chunks of 15 or 20 seconds each time, and we\u0027ll get to a point in, like, ten years where it\u0027s gonna get just south of 2:02, and then people will start talking time trials, getting serious.",

Caesar&#x2019;s new book, <em>Two Hours</em>, that articulates the first glimpse&#x2014;by British mountaineer George Mallory, in 1921&#x2014;of the summit of Mt. Everest. Mallory would disappear on an expedition in 1924, and Edmund Hillary wouldn&#x2019;t achieve full-scaling for another three decades, but this observation by Mallory vivifies the sense of being on the verge of something impossible without yet achieving it&#x2014;gazing at this thing and knowing it can be conquered but not knowing quite how or when or who:</p><div class="embed blockquote" data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.1"><blockquote><p>&#x201C;Mountain shapes are often fantastic seen through a mist, these were
like the wildest creation of a dream. A preposterous triangular lump
rose out of the depths; its edge came leaping up at an angle of about
70 degrees and ended nowhere. To the left a black serrated crest was
hanging in the sky incredibly. Gradually, very gradually, we saw the
great mountain sides and glaciers and ar&#xEA;tes, now one fragment and now
another through the floating rifts, until far higher in the sky than
imagination had dared to suggest the white summit of Everest appeared.
And in the series of partial glimpses we had seen a whole; we were
able to piece together the fragments to interpret the dream.&#x201D;</p></blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.2">In the book, Everest is deployed as a useful analogue for the two-hour marathon mark&#x2014;a barrier that has long seemed insurmountable (and that also lends its elegant simplicity to the title). Marathons have, as Caesar reminds us, a tremendous 2,500-year-old origin story: &#x201C;There is no better creation myth in sports.&#x201D; And there&#x2019;s plenty in this excellent (super-smooth, elite-marathon-runner-paced) debut of a book from an excellent young British journalist to contextualize that origin (the supposed 26-ish-mile run by Pheidippides from the battlefield of Marathon, Greece, to Athens), history, and the current conditions of competition among, typically, a group of runners from the narrowest sliver of the earth, the Rift Valley of Kenya. <em>Two Hours</em> is something of a twin narrative&#x2014;the story of one of those runners and his compatriots, who each year are extruded into the wider world for at least a couple of the marathon majors (New York, Boston, Berlin, London); and the story of science and sport&#x2019;s obsession with that arbitrary, round mark, the breaking of two hours many believe to be possible (the record is currently 2:02:57), if not imminent.</p><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.3">Caesar, who&#x2019;s in town for the American launch of his book and this weekend&#x2019;s New York City marathon, helped us stoke the marathon flames with something of a viewing guide for Sunday&#x2019;s race:</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.5"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5633a106f006d32a02e82988/master/w_600/two-hours-cover.jpg" alt="two-hours-cover.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhow-to-watch-the-new-york-city-marathon&amp;t=two-hours-cover.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhow-to-watch-the-new-york-city-marathon&amp;t=two-hours-cover.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhow-to-watch-the-new-york-city-marathon&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5633a106f006d32a02e82988%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftwo-hours-cover.jpg&amp;description=two-hours-cover.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhow-to-watch-the-new-york-city-marathon&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5633a106f006d32a02e82988%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftwo-hours-cover.jpg&amp;description=two-hours-cover.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>The book has a pretty emphatic answer to this question, but I&#x2019;ll ask it straight: Will the two-hour mark ever be broken at New York?</strong><br>You&apos;d never ever get a world record at New York. There&apos;s just too much up and down in New York. There are bridges that are actually kind of steep. There are no pacemakers, so the athletes do all the pacing themselves. So it doesn&apos;t always mean slower times, but it quite often means slower times. Unlike some courses, it&apos;s not straightforward, it&apos;s not smooth sailing. There&apos;s sharp corners to negotiate. You know, Bill Rodgers, when he ran the first five-borough [New York City marathon] in 1976, came in at 2:10&#x2014;but he said it was like urban cross-country, the New York course, which is not a bad description of what it is. [The current record is 2:05:06.]</p><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Set the table for Sunday&#x2019;s race. Who are our top contenders? How have they fared this year? How will they spend their week?</strong><br>So the big favorite for this year would be Wilson Kipsang, who won New York last year in an incredible race, and he&apos;s won London twice. He&apos;s the former world-record holder, and he&#x2019;d have arrived a few days ago. He&apos;d check into the hotel and basically on every day have another media or sponsored engagement. On Tuesday or Wednesday, he&apos;d probably get the kinks out of his legs, do quite a bit of running, go out to Tavern on the Green and see the finishing line. But I don&apos;t think he&apos;d walk the course.</p><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.8">I remember Geoffrey Mutai [the main character of <em>Two Hours</em>] telling me about before he first ran Boston. He arrived on the Tuesday before the Monday race, which everyone thought was a little early, but he wanted to make sure that he was familiar with the course, and so he took a taxi with his manager from the start to the finish, and he got to the end and he asked the guy, who&apos;d run it the year before, who set the course record, he says, &quot;How did you run 2:05 on that?&quot; You know, he&apos;s like, been in a taxi, he&apos;s like, &quot;It&apos;s ridiculous,&quot; and then the following Monday Geoffrey went out and ran 2:03:02.</p><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.9">But my feeling is Kipsang is not gonna go and, you know, look at it again. He&apos;ll probably sleep quite a lot. He&apos;ll take it as easy as he can. But it&apos;s quite a cool atmosphere in the hotel in the week leading up to the marathon because all the top guys are staying there, and there&apos;ll be a little debate bubbling around how fast it&apos;s gonna be this year&#x2014;splits and possible times for this year and who&apos;s in shape and who&apos;s not in shape and so on.</p><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>So Kipsang as a favorite. Who are you watching?</strong><br>Well, I would say that in my head, there&apos;s a young kid called Geoffrey Kipsang Kamworor [no relation to Wilson], who is an astonishing athlete, but he&apos;s never quite done it at the marathon business. So he&apos;s still in his early twenties. He&apos;s the world half-marathon champion. He&apos;s the world cross-country champion. He got the silver medal at the Worlds in the 10,000 meters behind Mo Farah in Beijing this summer, but every time he&apos;s gone out in a marathon, he&apos;s been in contention until about three miles from the end, and he just hasn&apos;t had the endurance. Everything that I hear from Kenya is that the guy&apos;s in shape now. With all that speed, he&apos;s gonna be able to hold on for the final miles. So it&apos;ll be pretty interesting. So how he goes up against Kipsang, who&apos;s a beautiful runner to watch. Kamworor looks like a bull tilting at a matador. He runs with a kind of shoulder tucked in as he goes around corners. And the first time I ever saw him train was at a place in Kenya, a dust track. And because of his style, because he&apos;s got quite strong shoulders for a marathon runner, and because he&apos;s got a very determined face, and because he tucks his shoulder in, and there were these puffs of dust coming out from behind him when he was running. And he did look so much like a bull.</p><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>If someone has a chance to watch in person this weekend, what&#x2019;s the approach?</strong><br>There&apos;s something to be said for being at the course. Just watching them go past a couple of times is pretty incredible. There&apos;s a way to do it in New York&#x2014;because the course is actually quite conducive to watching in two or three different places&#x2014;where you can catch them in Brooklyn and then catch them coming up First Avenue and then maybe catch them coming down Fifth Avenue at the end, just before they go into the park, which is normally where the real action is.</p><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>And what about at home?</strong><br>The real marathon-heads tend to watch the TV coverage while also reading one or two live feeds. LetsRun&#x2014;a big running website in the U.S.&#x2014;they do a really good live blog, so you can kind of toggle between the written coverage and the glimpses that you get on TV.</p><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Why can&#x2019;t I just turn on my TV?</strong><br>In general American TV coverage of marathons is not all about the elites. They quite often spend three or four minutes watching the top men and women. And then they&apos;ll spend 15 minutes looking at the guy dressed as a banana, who&apos;s gonna run four hours. So you might want to get a live stream.</p><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>So if not a two-hour record this weekend, how do you see it finally falling?</strong><br>My big caveat is that, first of all, people that make predictions about stuff tend to end up looking pretty stupid. And there is a long line of very clever people who have been made to look extremely stupid by what has actually turned out to be, in the case in sports and in all kinds of arenas where you try to predict when stuff&apos;s gonna happen. Having said that, I do generally think we are getting closer, and it might not be too long before we see the two-hour marathon, because I think the sport might change a little bit to prioritize time trials.</p><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Tell me about the time trials.</strong><br>So at the moment the world&apos;s best marathon runners run two marathons a year, and they generally run them in a big city like Boston or New York or London or Berlin. And so it&apos;s not possible to break a world record on all of those courses&#x2014;marathon courses are different, and generally the world record is broken in Berlin because it&apos;s the fastest. It&apos;s flat, set up for fast times, you have really good pacemakers, et cetera. The weather&apos;s normally perfect. So you know only two or three athletes at any one time, top athletes can run in Berlin, so there really aren&apos;t a lot of opportunities to break the world record. So as the world record gets toward two hours, I think what you might see is specialist time trials that are kind of outside the city marathon, where people will be paid to run on a specialist track of maybe six or eight miles. A marathon in specialist conditions, with the aim being like: Can we get it past two hours? And I think that could happen. I think the shoe companies would be interested in that.</p><p data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>There&#x2019;s mention of that in the book&#x2014;someone or some company putting up the money as an incentive. The way mathematicians have million-dollar prizes.</strong><br>I could see it happening. I could see it being a big TV event. I could also see why it would suit a lot of people for that to happen. I could see why Adidas would want it to happen. You know, if they&apos;ve got a group of guys all wearing their shoes, trying to break the two-hour marathon, can you imagine a better advert for their sports? So I just think it&apos;s gonna be a little while before we get there. I think people will chip away at the world record as they&apos;re doing right now, in chunks of 15 or 20 seconds each time, and we&apos;ll get to a point in, like, ten years where it&apos;s gonna get just south of 2:02, and then people will start talking time trials, getting serious.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1u9a4onwvsw.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
