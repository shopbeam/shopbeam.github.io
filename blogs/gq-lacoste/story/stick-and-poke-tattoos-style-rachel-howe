  	    "articleBody": "Rachel Howe, a.k.a. @smallspells, is a multidisciplinary artist working in Brooklyn, New York. She describes her artwork as three intersecting yet distinct practices: ceramics, all the new age stuff (tarot readings, Reiki, and Astrology which she posts on her instagram feed), and illustration. In addition Rachel tattoos her original drawings on friends using a method called \u0022stick and poke.\u0022 What were once known as \u0022jail tattoos\u0022 have become exceedingly popular among young creative types with a different view of tattooing. Stick and poke is less about being tough and more about shared artwork among friends. It\u0027s also quite possibly the last and only transgressive way to get tattooed. We sat down with Rachel to get the skinny on how they work and why people like them.\u000A\u000A[Editor\u0027s note: While we ARE saying stick and poke tattoos are cool, we also acknowledge the potential risks. Have fun, be safe.]\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s the deal with stick and poke tattoos?The thing about stick and pokes is they\u0027re this unregulated thing. That\u0027s part of what makes them cool. Right now, there are a bunch of people doing them who are trying to make stick and pokes better quality and actually give really good tattoos. The difference is that they\u0027re done in a more intimate placeâ€”at home. It\u0027s a different vibe than going to a shop. \u000A\u000AProfessional tattoos are expensive. So people end up doing them for themselves and friends. It\u0027s the same with clothing, I make stuff for myself because I can\u0027t afford, or don\u0027t want, the expensive version. It\u0027s a more direct art form. People are craving that now. Because so much of what is available is over processed.\u000A\u000AHow do you do a good stick and poke tattoo, without it fading away?Well, I\u0027ve actually never done a stick and poke with a sewing needle. I\u0027ve only ever used tattoo needles, and that makes it a lot easier. You\u0027re basically replicating the professional tattoo, but just doing it slower and by hand. Tattoo needles are made to hold ink and to poke into skin. It\u0027s a rod with a bunch of needles bundled together in a circle. So, each poke you make is actually five little ones. And there\u0027s space to hold the ink, so you can do a bunch of pokes before needing to dip back into the ink. It\u0027s like poke poke poke, dip into the little container of ink, poke poke poke, dip. Just keep repeating that. I go over it a few times. Until the line gets consistent and it goes in deep enough. At first get it can look pretty dotty, but over hours or the next day, it will settle into the skin and look more like a line. You\u0027re basically just building up dots to make a line. \u000A\u000AIs it always a new needle for each person?Yeah, they\u0027re all individually wrapped needles, individual disposable containers for the ink, paper towels, everything is disposable. \u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s the most popular tattoo you have done?A lot of people have gotten this crystal ball that says \u0022YES\u0022 inside. The thing I like about doing this is: I make a drawing, someone likes the drawing, and then they ask me for a tattoo of it. I\u0027m not a shop where someone comes and says, \u0022Oh I want a tattoo of a car.\u0022 I tattoo my own drawings on people, and I didn\u0027t draw that car. I do this in my home, and I want to be able to say no to someone if I just don\u0027t feel like we really vibe together. I want to be able to control who I\u0027m inviting in.\u000A\u000AHow do the tattoos play a role in your other artwork?After art school I was more in the art world, I was working at galleries, and showing at galleries. What I\u0027m doing now feels totally different, it\u0027s for a different audience. And I don\u0027t really care about art world stuff anymore. The things that I\u0027m making are more well received and I feel more creative now. So doing my drawings as tattoos feels really good to me. That\u0027s a good place for the drawings to go. That wouldn\u0027t really have been a viable option presented to me when I was in art school. \u000A\u000ADo you have any tattoos that you wish someone had stopped you from getting?Umm, the giant tattoo I have on my back, that I got when I was 19. While I was in college I worked at a tattoo shop as a receptionist. Tattooing had been illegal in New York City. And this was right when it became legal again. The shop was all men. It was just so heavy with attitude and at times it was such a negative atmosphere. There was a lot of sexual harassment, a lot of guys being assholes. Everyone was always doing tattoos on each other, and one of the guys that I was more friendly with was like, \u0022oh let\u0027s do a giant back-piece on your back\u0022 and I was like \u0022OK\u0022 because I was 19. It\u0027s a Japanese style geisha woman. I don\u0027t hate it, but it\u0027s something that I hardly ever see and it\u0027s taking up a lot of space. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWhat was the first tattoo that you did on yourself?The Bart Simpson. I do a lot on myself. If I have an idea of something I\u0027ll just do it on myself. When I was starting, I did a bunch on my ankles just because I didn\u0027t know how it would turn out. \u000A\u000AWhat could go wrong?If you go too fast you can get a lot of stray dots or wavy lines.  \u000A\u000AWhy is Bart such a popular stick and poke tattoo?I think it\u0027s just because Bart is bad. He\u0027s a bad kid. He doesn\u0027t care about anything, he skateboards, and probably for the whole time The Simpsons has been on the air, there\u0027s been this other illegitimate Simpsons culture, like the black Bart. He\u0027s already a cool character, and then he\u0027s been bootlegged for decades, and that\u0027s cool too. He\u0027s an easy character to draw, and then you can make it so weird. \u000A\u000ADo tattoos mean anything in 2015?It\u0027s interesting that tattoos have become kind of clean. If there\u0027s a bro with full sleeve tattoos, he doesn\u0027t look cool or tough, he doesn\u0027t look like any of the things tattoos used to mean. Tattoos used to send a message. Maybe, like, \u0022I\u0027m a scary person\u0022, \u0022I\u0027ve done some bad things\u0022, or \u0022I do some bad things\u0022. It was telling the world what type of person you are, someone who doesn\u0027t give a fuck or isn\u0027t trying to have a job. Now that message is gone. And that\u0027s why stick and pokes are popular. Because you, like, obviously got it in someone\u0027s bedroom. It still has a bit of an underground feel. You had to seek something out. You didn\u0027t just go to a shop and buy it.",

href="https://instagram.com/smallspells/">@smallspells</a>, on how they work and why people like them</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.0">Rachel Howe, a.k.a. <a href="https://instagram.com/smallspells/">@smallspells</a>, is a multidisciplinary artist working in Brooklyn, New York. She describes her artwork as three intersecting yet distinct practices: ceramics, all the new age stuff (tarot readings, Reiki, and Astrology which she posts on her instagram feed), and illustration. In addition Rachel tattoos her original drawings on friends using a method called &quot;stick and poke.&quot; What were once known as &quot;jail tattoos&quot; have become exceedingly popular among young creative types with a different view of tattooing. Stick and poke is less about being tough and more about shared artwork among friends. It&apos;s also quite possibly the last and only transgressive way to get tattooed. We sat down with Rachel to get the skinny on how they work and why people like them.</p><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.1">[<em>Editor&apos;s note: While we ARE saying stick and poke tattoos are cool, we also acknowledge the potential risks. Have fun, be safe</em>.]</p><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>What&apos;s the deal with stick and poke tattoos?</strong><br>The thing about stick and pokes is they&apos;re this unregulated thing. That&#x2019;s part of what makes them cool. Right now, there are a bunch of people doing them who are trying to make stick and pokes better quality and actually give really good tattoos. The difference is that they&apos;re done in a more intimate place&#x2014;at home. It&apos;s a different vibe than going to a shop. </p><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.3">Professional tattoos are expensive. So people end up doing them for themselves and friends. It&apos;s the same with clothing, I make stuff for myself because I can&apos;t afford, or don&#x2019;t want, the expensive version. It&#x2019;s a more direct art form. People are craving that now. Because so much of what is available is over processed.</p><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>How do you do a good stick and poke tattoo, without it fading away?</strong><br>Well, I&#x2019;ve actually never done a stick and poke with a sewing needle. I&#x2019;ve only ever used tattoo needles, and that makes it a lot easier. You&#x2019;re basically replicating the professional tattoo, but just doing it slower and by hand. Tattoo needles are made to hold ink and to poke into skin. It&#x2019;s a rod with a bunch of needles bundled together in a circle. So, each poke you make is actually five little ones. And there&#x2019;s space to hold the ink, so you can do a bunch of pokes before needing to dip back into the ink. It&#x2019;s like poke poke poke, dip into the little container of ink, poke poke poke, dip. Just keep repeating that. I go over it a few times. Until the line gets consistent and it goes in deep enough. At first get it can look pretty dotty, but over hours or the next day, it will settle into the skin and look more like a line. You&#x2019;re basically just building up dots to make a line. </p><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Is it always a new needle for each person?</strong><br>Yeah, they&#x2019;re all individually wrapped needles, individual disposable containers for the ink, paper towels, everything is disposable. </p><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>What&#x2019;s the most popular tattoo you have done?</strong><br>A lot of people have gotten this crystal ball that says &#x201C;YES&#x201D; inside. The thing I like about doing this is: I make a drawing, someone likes the drawing, and then they ask me for a tattoo of it. I&#x2019;m not a shop where someone comes and says, &#x201C;Oh I want a tattoo of a car.&#x201D; I tattoo my own drawings on people, and I didn&#x2019;t draw that car. I do this in my home, and I want to be able to say no to someone if I just don&#x2019;t feel like we really vibe together. I want to be able to control who I&#x2019;m inviting in.</p><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>How do the tattoos play a role in your other artwork?</strong><br>After art school I was more in the art world, I was working at galleries, and showing at galleries. What I&#x2019;m doing now feels totally different, it&#x2019;s for a different audience. And I don&#x2019;t really care about art world stuff anymore. The things that I&#x2019;m making are more well received and I feel more creative now. So doing my drawings as tattoos feels really good to me. That&#x2019;s a good place for the drawings to go. That wouldn&#x2019;t really have been a viable option presented to me when I was in art school. </p><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>Do you have any tattoos that you wish someone had stopped you from getting?</strong><br>Umm, the giant tattoo I have on my back, that I got when I was 19. While I was in college I worked at a tattoo shop as a receptionist. Tattooing had been illegal in New York City. And this was right when it became legal again. The shop was all men. It was just so heavy with attitude and at times it was such a negative atmosphere. There was a lot of sexual harassment, a lot of guys being assholes. Everyone was always doing tattoos on each other, and one of the guys that I was more friendly with was like, &#x201C;oh let&#x2019;s do a giant back-piece on your back&#x201D; and I was like &#x201C;OK&#x201D; because I was 19. It&#x2019;s a Japanese style geisha woman. I don&#x2019;t hate it, but it&#x2019;s something that I hardly ever see and it&#x2019;s taking up a lot of space. </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.a"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55d362b2fb580c9d76560a46/master/w_806/rachel-howe-stick-poke-03.jpg" alt="rachel-howe-stick-poke-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstick-and-poke-tattoos-style-rachel-howe&amp;t=rachel-howe-stick-poke-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstick-and-poke-tattoos-style-rachel-howe&amp;t=rachel-howe-stick-poke-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstick-and-poke-tattoos-style-rachel-howe&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55d362b2fb580c9d76560a46%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Frachel-howe-stick-poke-03.jpg&amp;description=rachel-howe-stick-poke-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstick-and-poke-tattoos-style-rachel-howe&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55d362b2fb580c9d76560a46%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Frachel-howe-stick-poke-03.jpg&amp;description=rachel-howe-stick-poke-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>What was the first tattoo that you did on yourself?</strong><br>The Bart Simpson. I do a lot on myself. If I have an idea of something I&#x2019;ll just do it on myself. When I was starting, I did a bunch on my ankles just because I didn&#x2019;t know how it would turn out. </p><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>What could go wrong?</strong><br>If you go too fast you can get a lot of stray dots or wavy lines.  </p><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Why is Bart such a popular stick and poke tattoo?</strong><br>I think it&#x2019;s just because Bart is bad. He&#x2019;s a bad kid. He doesn&#x2019;t care about anything, he skateboards, and probably for the whole time <em>The Simpsons</em> has been on the air, there&apos;s been this other illegitimate Simpsons culture, like the black Bart. He&#x2019;s already a cool character, and then he&#x2019;s been bootlegged for decades, and that&#x2019;s cool too. He&#x2019;s an easy character to draw, and then you can make it so weird. </p><p data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Do tattoos mean anything in 2015?</strong><br>It&#x2019;s interesting that tattoos have become kind of clean. If there&#x2019;s a bro with full sleeve tattoos, he doesn&#x2019;t look cool or tough, he doesn&#x2019;t look like any of the things tattoos used to mean. Tattoos used to send a message. Maybe, like, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a scary person&#x201D;, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve done some bad things&#x201D;, or &#x201C;I do some bad things&#x201D;. It was telling the world what type of person you are, someone who doesn&#x2019;t give a fuck or isn&#x2019;t trying to have a job. Now that message is gone. And that&#x2019;s why stick and pokes are popular. Because you, like, obviously got it in someone&#x2019;s bedroom. It still has a bit of an underground feel. You had to seek something out. You didn&#x2019;t just go to a shop and buy it. </p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".2e04bwf65fk.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
