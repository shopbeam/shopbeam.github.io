  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWhen the Baltimore Orioles needed a jolt last August, they called up 20-year-old Manny Machado from Double-A. Machado, a powerful 6-2 shortstop, was the third overall pick in the 2010 MLB draft--Manny\u0027s buddy Bryce Harper went first to Washington--and the jewel of Baltimore\u0027s farm system.\u000A\u000AThe O\u0027s inked Manny in at third base, and he played every inning of the Orioles\u0027 51 games following his promotion. He went 2-for-4 in his debut, and a day later smashed two home runs. Machado finished the season with 7 homers and 26 RBIs, and with him in the line-up, the O\u0027s went 33-18 and rolled all the way to the ALDS, where they lost to the Yanks.\u000A\u000AThis season, Machado says he\u0027s ready to pick up where he left off. And he\u0027s still got three months until he turns 21.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: First of all, congratulations on getting engaged in the offseason. Is there anything left for you to do before you turn 21?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: (laughs) Well, tomorrow is my first opening day, and then I turn 21 in July. Having a full year in the big leagues is exciting.\u000A\u000AGQ: I know you grew up in Miami. Were you a Marlins fan as a kid?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: Yeah, because that was my hometown team. My mom used to take me to games -- my mom\u0027s job actually had season tickets. So I was hitting up Mom for tickets and tagging along with her to the games.\u000A\u000AGQ: Was there any one Marlins player you liked? I know they never kept any one guy too long.\u000A\u000AManny Machado: I was really a fan of the games. I just liked going to the games, and I rooted for the team. I was there when they won the World Series in 2003--I was actually at that game. And earlier, when Pudge got trucked and held the ball, I was at that game. That was the first Playoff game I went to, so that was pretty exciting.\u000A\u000AGQ: My wife is Cuban and she kind of grew up in Miami, so I\u0027ve been to a lot of great Cuban restaurants down there. You\u0027re Dominican, so what do you think is the best Dominican spot in Miami?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: I want to say... my house? My grandma cooks all the Dominican food. Miami is a Cuban city, so everywhere you go you see Cuban food. So I guess I\u0027ll have to say my grandma\u0027s house.\u000A\u000AGQ: Alex Rodriguez is also from Miami and has been a mentor to you. What did he tell you as you were coming out of high school and going pro?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: He\u0027d been through everything that I was going through, so it really helped me out to have someone like him who could show me the ropes. It made it easier for me. One of the main things he told me was that the game will humble you quick, so just to stay humble your entire career. That was the main advice: To stay humble, give it all you can.\u000A\u000AGQ: Since you grew up in this advanced stat era, are you more aware of advanced stats than players were maybe a decade ago?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: You know, not really, honestly. I try not to look at stats. I\u0027m kind of superstitious about it. I try to stay away from stats, try not to look at them. Every once in a while you\u0027re going to glance at them, but I try to keep my mind far away from stats.\u000A\u000AGQ: But also, you know if you went 0-for-3, you had a bad day without looking at your numbers.\u000A\u000AManny Machado: Yeah. If you go 0-for-3, or you make an error, that\u0027s gonna stick. That\u0027s enough--you don\u0027t really need to look at the stats for that. If you get enough 0-for-3\u0027s, your stats are going to come down. So I try to stay away from reading it in the paper or up on the scoreboard or whatever.\u000A\u000AGQ: What was it like to make it to the majors? In the movies it\u0027s always like you get to the majors and suddenly you\u0027re in a five-star hotel and the locker rooms are all tricked-out. What was it like for you?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: It was something I\u0027d always dreamed about. It was cool to be a part of the team, to be an Oriole, once I got in that clubhouse, just the atmosphere. Instead of having 200 fans at a minor league game, there were tens of thousands of fans at the games. You stay in nicer hotels, so that\u0027s different. It was exciting, and something I\u0027ll never forget.\u000A\u000AGQ: Did the older players haze you last season?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: No, not really. They were pretty cool about it. My mom raised me to be humble, so I went in there humble, and they respected that, and I respected them, because they obviously had put in more time up there than I had. We have a good group of guys here--we\u0027re all kind of young, and we all fought together. So that made the first couple of months easier.\u000A\u000AGQ: Is there one at-bat you had last season that still sticks in your head?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: Definitely my first at bat. I was nervous, I was nervous that at bat. I\u0027ll never forget that first game. And then obviously in the Playoffs. I think the whole season last year, I could name every game, almost every at bat.\u000A\u000AGQ: The Orioles took some hits in the offseason for not making enough moves to improve, but how do you feel about the team going into this season?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: People criticized us that we didn\u0027t do any big transactions in free agency, but we have the same guys that we made the Playoffs with last year. We have us all together, and that\u0027s an advantage we have coming into this year. We have that team chemistry going into the year, and the team bond, which will help us throughout the whole season.\u000A\u000AGQ: How important is chemistry in baseball? Because it seems like baseball is really about one-on-one confrontations, and maybe not as much stuff where multiple guys are involved in a play like in basketball or football?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: It\u0027s something that our manager really preaches on, thinking about team and being a team, because baseball really is a team game. You know, if I strike out, I know the guy behind me--whether it be Jonesy, Markakis, any of my teammates--I know they\u0027re going to come back me up. Baseball is a team game, and I think if you have great team chemistry, that matters. That starts with our manager, who is a great guy, and he keeps us going and keeps us loose, and that\u0027s just going to help us out in the long run.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you think now that you have a chance to play a full season in the majors, people will talk about you the way they talk about Heyward and Harper and Trout and some of the other young stars?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: I really try not to read up a lot on that. You just control what you can. My goal is just control what happens on the field, and everything else will just take care of itself.\u000A\u000AGQ: Maybe you and Bryce Harper can have a battle for supremacy of the DC area? Maybe a wrestling match or something?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: (laughs) It\u0027s funny you say that, because we played together in 2009 on the same USA team, and we were roommates, so we\u0027re pretty close. When I got called up, he was one of the first people to text me and congratulate me. He texted me, like, \u0022It\u0027s on, who\u0027s gonna be the best in the Maryland/DC area?\u0022 I\u0027m really looking forward to seeing him in a couple of months when we have a couple of games against them.\u000A\u000AGQ: Maybe you could have a video game battle royale? Do you play video games?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: I play a little bit. I\u0027m a fan of NBA 2K, FIFA. I like sports games, but I don\u0027t play baseball games too much. I picked up the new \u0022The Show\u0022 that came out, I pick it up every year, but it\u0027s one of those games where you pick it up and you play it a few times and that\u0027s about it. I kind of stay with basketball and soccer. I like playing with Barcelona. I\u0027m a Messi fan. I\u0027m down with Messi, the best in the world.\u000A\u000AGQ: Have you ever played fantasy baseball?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: I tried it once, but I missed the draft so it did an autodraft, and I think that was the last time I ever saw it. I forgot the password and just never got into it.\u000A\u000AGQ: How much thought do you put into picking the perfect at-bat song?\u000A\u000AManny Machado: I\u0027m picky with my walk-up song, so I still haven\u0027t picked one. The people at Beats By Dre just hooked me up a little bit, and I love listening to music and wearing my headphones on the bus and the plane. But I might decide today. I have a little bit of Spanish music, or maybe Jay-Z. It\u0027s one of those two.",

Orioles needed a jolt last August, they called up 20-year-old Manny Machado from Double-A. Machado, a powerful 6-2 shortstop, was the third overall pick in the 2010 MLB draft--Manny&#x2019;s buddy Bryce Harper went first to Washington--and the jewel of Baltimore&#x2019;s farm system.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.2">The O&#x2019;s inked Manny in at third base, and he played every inning of the Orioles&#x2019; 51 games following his promotion. He went 2-for-4 in his debut, and a day later smashed two home runs. Machado finished the season with 7 homers and 26 RBIs, and with him in the line-up, the O&#x2019;s went 33-18 and rolled all the way to the ALDS, where they lost to the Yanks.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.3">This season, Machado says he&#x2019;s ready to pick up where he left off. And he&#x2019;s still got three months until he turns 21.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.5"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>GQ: First of all, congratulations on getting engaged in the offseason. Is there anything left for you to do before you turn 21?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.7">Manny Machado: (laughs) Well, tomorrow is my first opening day, and then I turn 21 in July. Having a full year in the big leagues is exciting.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>GQ: I know you grew up in Miami. Were you a Marlins fan as a kid?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.9">Manny Machado: Yeah, because that was my hometown team. My mom used to take me to games -- my mom&#x2019;s job actually had season tickets. So I was hitting up Mom for tickets and tagging along with her to the games.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>GQ: Was there any one Marlins player you liked? I know they never kept any one guy too long.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.b">Manny Machado: I was really a fan of the games. I just liked going to the games, and I rooted for the team. I was there when they won the World Series in 2003--I was actually at that game. And earlier, when Pudge got trucked and <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=13063009">held the ball</a>, I was at that game. That was the first Playoff game I went to, so that was pretty exciting.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>GQ: My wife is Cuban and she kind of grew up in Miami, so I&#x2019;ve been to a lot of great Cuban restaurants down there. You&#x2019;re Dominican, so what do you think is the best Dominican spot in Miami?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.d">Manny Machado: I want to say... my house? My grandma cooks all the Dominican food. Miami is a Cuban city, so everywhere you go you see Cuban food. So I guess I&#x2019;ll have to say my grandma&#x2019;s house.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>GQ: Alex Rodriguez is also from Miami and has been a mentor to you. What did he tell you as you were coming out of high school and going pro?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.f">Manny Machado: He&#x2019;d been through everything that I was going through, so it really helped me out to have someone like him who could show me the ropes. It made it easier for me. One of the main things he told me was that the game will humble you quick, so just to stay humble your entire career. That was the main advice: To stay humble, give it all you can.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>GQ: Since you grew up in this advanced stat era, are you more aware of advanced stats than players were maybe a decade ago?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.h">Manny Machado: You know, not really, honestly. I try not to look at stats. I&#x2019;m kind of superstitious about it. I try to stay away from stats, try not to look at them. Every once in a while you&#x2019;re going to glance at them, but I try to keep my mind far away from stats.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>GQ: But also, you know if you went 0-for-3, you had a bad day without looking at your numbers.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.j">Manny Machado: Yeah. If you go 0-for-3, or you make an error, that&#x2019;s gonna stick. That&#x2019;s enough--you don&#x2019;t really need to look at the stats for that. If you get enough 0-for-3&#x2019;s, your stats are going to come down. So I try to stay away from reading it in the paper or up on the scoreboard or whatever.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>GQ: What was it like to make it to the majors? In the movies it&#x2019;s always like you get to the majors and suddenly you&#x2019;re in a five-star hotel and the locker rooms are all tricked-out. What was it like for you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.l">Manny Machado: It was something I&#x2019;d always dreamed about. It was cool to be a part of the team, to be an Oriole, once I got in that clubhouse, just the atmosphere. Instead of having 200 fans at a minor league game, there were tens of thousands of fans at the games. You stay in nicer hotels, so that&#x2019;s different. It was exciting, and something I&#x2019;ll never forget.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>GQ: Did the older players haze you last season?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.n">Manny Machado: No, not really. They were pretty cool about it. My mom raised me to be humble, so I went in there humble, and they respected that, and I respected them, because they obviously had put in more time up there than I had. We have a good group of guys here--we&#x2019;re all kind of young, and we all fought together. So that made the first couple of months easier.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>GQ: Is there one at-bat you had last season that still sticks in your head?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.p">Manny Machado: Definitely my first at bat. I was nervous, I was nervous that at bat. I&#x2019;ll never forget that first game. And then obviously in the Playoffs. I think the whole season last year, I could name every game, almost every at bat.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>GQ: The Orioles took some hits in the offseason for not making enough moves to improve, but how do you feel about the team going into this season?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.r">Manny Machado: People criticized us that we didn&#x2019;t do any big transactions in free agency, but we have the same guys that we made the Playoffs with last year. We have us all together, and that&#x2019;s an advantage we have coming into this year. We have that team chemistry going into the year, and the team bond, which will help us throughout the whole season.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>GQ: How important is chemistry in baseball? Because it seems like baseball is really about one-on-one confrontations, and maybe not as much stuff where multiple guys are involved in a play like in basketball or football?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.t">Manny Machado: It&#x2019;s something that our manager really preaches on, thinking about team and being a team, because baseball really is a team game. You know, if I strike out, I know the guy behind me--whether it be Jonesy, Markakis, any of my teammates--I know they&#x2019;re going to come back me up. Baseball is a team game, and I think if you have great team chemistry, that matters. That starts with our manager, who is a great guy, and he keeps us going and keeps us loose, and that&#x2019;s just going to help us out in the long run.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong>GQ: Do you think now that you have a chance to play a full season in the majors, people will talk about you the way they talk about Heyward and Harper and Trout and some of the other young stars?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.v">Manny Machado: I really try not to read up a lot on that. You just control what you can. My goal is just control what happens on the field, and everything else will just take care of itself.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong>GQ: Maybe you and Bryce Harper can have a battle for supremacy of the DC area? Maybe a wrestling match or something?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.x">Manny Machado: (laughs) It&#x2019;s funny you say that, because we played together in 2009 on the same USA team, and we were roommates, so we&#x2019;re pretty close. When I got called up, he was one of the first people to text me and congratulate me. He texted me, like, &quot;It&#x2019;s on, who&#x2019;s gonna be the best in the Maryland/DC area?&quot; I&#x2019;m really looking forward to seeing him in a couple of months when we have a couple of games against them.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.y"><strong>GQ: Maybe you could have a video game battle royale? Do you play video games?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.z">Manny Machado: I play a little bit. I&#x2019;m a fan of NBA 2K, FIFA. I like sports games, but I don&#x2019;t play baseball games too much. I picked up the new &quot;The Show&quot; that came out, I pick it up every year, but it&#x2019;s one of those games where you pick it up and you play it a few times and that&#x2019;s about it. I kind of stay with basketball and soccer. I like playing with Barcelona. I&#x2019;m a Messi fan. I&#x2019;m down with Messi, the best in the world.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong>GQ: Have you ever played fantasy baseball?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.11">Manny Machado: I tried it once, but I missed the draft so it did an autodraft, and I think that was the last time I ever saw it. I forgot the password and just never got into it.</p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.12"><strong>GQ: How much thought do you put into picking the perfect at-bat song?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.4.13">Manny Machado: I&#x2019;m picky with my walk-up song, so I still haven&#x2019;t picked one. The people at Beats By Dre just hooked me up a little bit, and I love listening to music and wearing my headphones on the bus and the plane. But I might decide today. I have a little bit of Spanish music, or maybe Jay-Z. It&#x2019;s one of those two.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1v9jbt0p9fk.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
