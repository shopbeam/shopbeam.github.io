  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestGetty Images for Hublot\u000A\u000AIn case you were wondering, Dwyane Wade is secure in his manhood. During a dinner in Miami to celebrate the third year of his partnership with luxury watch brand Hublot, the Heat superstar is answering questions from the crowd via slips of paper when he opens one girlfriend Gabrielle Union has snuck in: \u0022In Scandal, do you think Fitz should end up with Mellie or Liv?\u0022 it reads. Wade laughs, and without missing a beat delivers a thoughtful analysis of the love triangle in ABC\u0027s female-obsessed hit show.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s the kind of self-assurance only men with size 14 feet and three championship rings get to carry around, and is likely the reason the stylish athlete has never shied away from, say, sporting a Gucci polka dot cropped pant suit to an away game. We sat down with Wade, who says he\u0027s actually starting to skew back to a more classic style, earlier in the day to discuss his rules for picking out a timepiece, the art of sitting down in tight pants, and the reason he gets heat from LeBron over his off-court fashion.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: Dwyane, I\u0027m from Chicago so I\u0027m actually here to recruit you to come home and save the Bulls.\u000A\u000ADwyane Wade: (Laughs) What about that weather up there, though? I\u0027ve got that Miami blood now, I just sold my house in Chicago.\u000A\u000AGQ: That Miami style, too. In fact you\u0027ve got watch designer on your resumé. How\u0027s that going?\u000A\u000AWade: It\u0027s cool. Obviously, I\u0027m a fan of watches but you never envision yourself having your own watch. Basketball players envision our own sneakers. When I\u0027m designing I try to think about what I like to see on other people. The first watch I worked on had more of a casual basketball feel to it, and the most recent one I designed was a little more classic. I wanted people to be able to wear it with suits or casual clothes.\u000A\u000AGQ: What goes through your mind when you\u0027re buying a watch?\u000A\u000AWade: I want something that goes with many different outfits, so clothes are a huge part of the equation. I always go, \u0022okay, I need something with gold in it.\u0022 Or \u0022I need something with silver or black.\u0022 And then it\u0027s about the face. Do I want a bigger face, do I want a smaller face? Do I want a thick band, a skinny band? I always say the watch is the finishing touch. I get dressed, and then the watch is the last thing to go on.\u000A\u000AGQ: There\u0027s been a lot of chatter about the NBA style revolution over the past few years. How would you say your style has evolved?\u000A\u000AWade: I have help now! I\u0027ve always cared about my personal style and the way people perceive me. I know a lot of times people don\u0027t get the opportunity to talk to me, so they\u0027re just going to see what I wear, see how I\u0027m dressed, see how I present myself. My style right now is not as wild, not as crazy. It\u0027s a little more laid back and a little more chill. My schedule is busy so my stylist helps me shop, but also sitting down with her opens my eyes to things I would have never thought of. I get killed for some of the things I wear, but it\u0027s what I\u0027m comfortable with.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you have a vision when you get dressed? How does it all come together?\u000A\u000AWade: When it comes to the basketball side of me, it all starts with the sneakers and goes up from there. But when it comes to my dress side, it doesn\u0027t necessarily start with the sneakers. Throughout the year I might do five or six big fittings where I go through all these different looks to see how they look on my body, how they feel on my body. I\u0027ve got big feet and I don\u0027t like hard bottom shoes, I like to be comfortable. So we\u0027ve gotta go out and find the right style of shoes and all those kinds of things.\u000A\u000AGQ: Can you buy off the rack at all?\u000A\u000AWade: I can! The reason I can buy off the rack is because I\u0027m the kind of person who will wear smaller clothes. The jacket\u0027s too small, roll up the sleeves. The pants are too small, roll \u0027em up. My style has gone to the level where I\u0027m not caring about the exact fit.\u000A\u000AGQ: It probably would have been a major faux pas if, say, LeBron had shown up to the White House last January after the championship win wearing the same Louboutin sneakers you did. Do you guys ever go head-to-head over fashion?\u000A\u000AWade: Not really. He has his own style and I have mine. Even though there\u0027s some similarity, it\u0027s different overall.\u000A\u000AGQ: You just grimaced when you said \u0022his style.\u0022\u000A\u000AWade: (Laughs) No, no, I like his style. I\u0027m a fan of his style. We\u0027re close friends and there have been times when we\u0027ve worn maybe the exact same color, and I\u0027m like, well, this ain\u0027t good. But we never wear the exact same thing. I take more chances than he takes. There are things that I\u0027ll wear and he\u0027ll be like, \u0022Yo you trippin\u0027,\u0022 because it\u0027s not him. And I like that I have my own lane in that sense. But I like his style, and I like Chris Bosh\u0027s style. I don\u0027t think mine is the only way to go. You have to be really comfortable with who you are to dress how I dress.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you remember the first time you thought: \u0022I finally get this fashion thing?\u0022\u000A\u000AWade: When I was young I was always looking at how my dad dressed and how my uncle dressed, and thought, \u0022I can\u0027t wait until I get old and I can dress.\u0022 But it didn\u0027t really take on the way I wanted it to until about 2008. That\u0027s when I started feeling comfortable wearing what I wanted to wear. That\u0027s when I shedded the big clothes and I went to the kind of Euro look. I had to get adjusted to sitting down in tighter pants, but I\u0027m used to it now. You\u0027ve just got to sit down a little different, you\u0027ve gotta slide down, you can\u0027t just plop.\u000A\u000AGQ: Tell me about it. It sounds like you\u0027ve got a lot going on in your closet, but if there were only three things that you could keep, what would they be?\u000A\u000AWade: Oh Jesus. I only get to pick three?! Okay, well... I\u0027d probably pick a classic black suit that I can wear to many different occasions and a classic white shirt to go with it. Dsquared makes my favorite suits right now. And since I\u0027m an athlete and I would have to keep a pair of my most comfortable shoes, probably my Del Toro Chukkas because they\u0027re versatile. And since I live in Miami I would have to keep a pair of white pants, I love my white pants.\u000A\u000AGQ: Speaking of favorites, what do you think has been your best red carpet look?\u000A\u000AWade: That\u0027s a good question. I\u0027m just going to go with the first one that came to mind. This summer when I went to the Emmys party in LA, I wore this green Valentino suit. Green is not my color, but when I put it on I felt important. I felt like, \u0022I should be going to the Emmys party, they need to see me in this.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestGetty Images",

During a dinner in Miami to celebrate the third year of his partnership with luxury watch brand Hublot, the Heat superstar is answering questions from the crowd via slips of paper when he opens one girlfriend Gabrielle Union has snuck in: &quot;In <em>Scandal</em>, do you think Fitz should end up with Mellie or Liv?&quot; it reads. Wade laughs, and without missing a beat delivers a thoughtful analysis of the love triangle in ABC&#x2019;s female-obsessed hit show.</p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.2">It&#x2019;s the kind of self-assurance only men with size 14 feet and three championship rings get to carry around, and is likely the reason <a href="http://www.gq.com/sports-list/20-most-stylish-athletes-of-2013/12?intcid=prev">the stylish athlete</a> has never shied away from, say, sporting a Gucci polka dot cropped pant suit to an away game. We sat down with Wade, who says he&#x2019;s actually starting to skew back to a more classic style, earlier in the day to discuss his rules for picking out a timepiece, the art of sitting down in tight pants, and the reason he gets heat from LeBron over his off-court fashion.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.3"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong><em>GQ:</em> Dwyane, I&#x2019;m from Chicago so I&#x2019;m actually here to recruit you to come home and save the Bulls.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Dwyane Wade:</strong> (Laughs) What about that weather up there, though? I&#x2019;ve got that Miami blood now, I just sold my house in Chicago.</p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong><em>GQ:</em> That Miami style, too. In fact you&#x2019;ve got watch designer on your resum&#xE9;. How&#x2019;s that going?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Wade:</strong> It&#x2019;s cool. Obviously, I&#x2019;m a fan of watches but you never envision yourself having your own watch. Basketball players envision our own sneakers. When I&#x2019;m designing I try to think about what I like to see on other people. The first watch I worked on had more of a casual basketball feel to it, and the most recent one I designed was a little more classic. I wanted people to be able to wear it with suits or casual clothes.</p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong><em>GQ:</em> What goes through your mind when you&#x2019;re buying a watch?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Wade:</strong> I want something that goes with many different outfits, so clothes are a huge part of the equation. I always go, &quot;okay, I need something with gold in it.&quot; Or &quot;I need something with silver or black.&quot; And then it&#x2019;s about the face. Do I want a bigger face, do I want a smaller face? Do I want a thick band, a skinny band? I always say the watch is the finishing touch. I get dressed, and then the watch is the last thing to go on.</p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong><em>GQ:</em> There&#x2019;s been a lot of chatter about the NBA style revolution over the past few years. How would you say your style has evolved?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Wade:</strong> I have help now! I&#x2019;ve always cared about my personal style and the way people perceive me. I know a lot of times people don&#x2019;t get the opportunity to talk to me, so they&#x2019;re just going to see what I wear, see how I&#x2019;m dressed, see how I present myself. My style right now is not as wild, not as crazy. It&#x2019;s a little more laid back and a little more chill. My schedule is busy so my stylist helps me shop, but also sitting down with her opens my eyes to things I would have never thought of. I get killed for some of the things I wear, but it&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m comfortable with.</p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong><em>GQ:</em> Do you have a vision when you get dressed? How does it all come together?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Wade:</strong> When it comes to the basketball side of me, it all starts with the sneakers and goes up from there. But when it comes to my dress side, it doesn&#x2019;t necessarily start with the sneakers. Throughout the year I might do five or six big fittings where I go through all these different looks to see how they look on my body, how they feel on my body. I&#x2019;ve got big feet and I don&#x2019;t like hard bottom shoes, I like to be comfortable. So we&#x2019;ve gotta go out and find the right style of shoes and all those kinds of things.</p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong><em>GQ:</em> Can you buy off the rack at all?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Wade:</strong> I can! The reason I can buy off the rack is because I&#x2019;m the kind of person who will wear smaller clothes. The jacket&#x2019;s too small, roll up the sleeves. The pants are too small, roll &#x2019;em up. My style has gone to the level where I&#x2019;m not caring about the exact fit.</p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong><em>GQ:</em> It probably would have been a major faux pas if, say, LeBron had shown up to the White House last January after the championship win wearing the same Louboutin sneakers you did. Do you guys ever go head-to-head over fashion?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Wade:</strong> Not really. He has his own style and I have mine. Even though there&#x2019;s some similarity, it&#x2019;s different overall.</p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong><em>GQ:</em> You just grimaced when you said &quot;his style.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Wade:</strong> (Laughs) No, no, I like his style. I&#x2019;m a fan of his style. We&#x2019;re close friends and there have been times when we&#x2019;ve worn maybe the exact same color, and I&#x2019;m like, well, this ain&#x2019;t good. But we never wear the exact same thing. I take more chances than he takes. There are things that I&#x2019;ll wear and he&#x2019;ll be like, &quot;Yo you trippin&#x2019;,&quot; because it&#x2019;s not him. And I like that I have my own lane in that sense. But I like his style, and I like Chris Bosh&#x2019;s style. I don&#x2019;t think mine is the only way to go. You have to be really comfortable with who you are to dress how I dress.</p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong><em>GQ:</em> Do you remember the first time you thought: &quot;I finally get this fashion thing?&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Wade:</strong> When I was young I was always looking at how my dad dressed and how my uncle dressed, and thought, &quot;I can&#x2019;t wait until I get old and I can dress.&quot; But it didn&#x2019;t really take on the way I wanted it to until about 2008. That&#x2019;s when I started feeling comfortable wearing what I wanted to wear. That&#x2019;s when I shedded the big clothes and I went to the kind of Euro look. I had to get adjusted to sitting down in tighter pants, but I&#x2019;m used to it now. You&#x2019;ve just got to sit down a little different, you&#x2019;ve gotta slide down, you can&#x2019;t just plop.</p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong><em>GQ:</em> Tell me about it. It sounds like you&#x2019;ve got a lot going on in your closet, but if there were only three things that you could keep, what would they be?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>Wade:</strong> Oh Jesus. I only get to pick three?! Okay, well... I&#x2019;d probably pick a classic black suit that I can wear to many different occasions and a classic white shirt to go with it. Dsquared makes my favorite suits right now. And since I&#x2019;m an athlete and I would have to keep a pair of my most comfortable shoes, probably my Del Toro Chukkas because they&#x2019;re versatile. And since I live in Miami I would have to keep a pair of white pants, I love my white pants.</p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong><em>GQ:</em> Speaking of favorites, what do you think has been your best red carpet look?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>Wade:</strong> That&#x2019;s a good question. I&#x2019;m just going to go with the first one that came to mind. This summer when I went to the Emmys party in LA, I wore this green Valentino suit. Green is not my color, but when I put it on I felt important. I felt like, &quot;I <em>should</em> be going to the Emmys party, they need to see me in this.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".6onp9iq4n4.1.1.0.0.4.r"><figure class="embedded-image"
