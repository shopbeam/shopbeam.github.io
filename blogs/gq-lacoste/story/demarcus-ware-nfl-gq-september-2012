  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware doesn\u0027t fit the profile of a guy who wrecks quarterbacks for a living. The Dallas Cowboys All-Pro linebacker—one of the most feared pass rushers in the NFL—is a brains-over-brawn kind of athlete, which is a scary thought when you\u0027re bringing the kind of brawn he\u0027s got. This is a strange time in the NFL to be a sack specialist, though: as most of them will tell you, the league slaps fines on guys for breathing too hard on a quarterback—an unmistakable trend in the rules that often seems at odds with the sport\u0027s broader glorification of hard hits and jacked-up highlights. Ware spoke with GQ about the NFL\u0027s ambivalence toward violence, how he stays on the right side of the rules—and the moment in his career when he was so scared that he didn\u0027t know if he could ever play again.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AGQ: Who were the pass rushers you grew up watching?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  The guy I really like is [Rams Hall of Famer] Deacon Jones. When I see Deacon Jones, we sit down and have deep conversations. We just talk about stuff.\u000A\u000AGQ: I met Deacon Jones once and five seconds into the conversation, he told me he once had fifty-five sacks in a season, before they officially kept track of sack totals.\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  [Laughs] Of course he did. He\u0027s a great guy. Every time I see Deacon, I say, \u0022What\u0027s up?\u0022 and right away he\u0027s telling me, \u0022You\u0027ve got to work on this,\u0022 or, \u0022You\u0027ve got to work on that.\u0022 He says, \u0022You\u0027ve got to try the head slap\u0022 or \u0022You\u0027re not trash talking right. You\u0027re not a good trash talker.\u0022 He is straight up. When he talks, he doesn\u0027t sugarcoat anything. He\u0027s going to tell you straight up what he thinks. And he\u0027s ready to get right back out there and play. Like, now.\u000A\u000AGQ: Is there a certain technique you\u0027ve mastered others haven\u0027t? Signature moves?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  I\u0027m the Emulator. I\u0027m a technician. Every week, I\u0027m going to have different moves based on the film I watch. I like revealing something totally different every Sunday. I\u0027ll get in the film room around 6 o\u0027clock in the morning. I\u0027ll watch, say, three hours a day all by myself. I chart who is effective and see what works. Then, whatever that offensive tackle wasn\u0027t good at? I make sure I\u0027m going to master it that whole week. I may even be uncomfortable with it, but I\u0027m going to do it. Because I\u0027m going to do all the negative things that you don\u0027t like. I\u0027m going to get in your head.  \u000A\u000AGQ: It\u0027s such a chess game, because they\u0027re spending their whole week studying your tape.\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  It is a chess match, and you know what? I love to play it. I like to know whatever those guys are doing. When people ask me, \u0022How many moves do you have?\u0022 I tell them, \u0022Unlimited.\u0022 Because every day, it changes. Usually pass rushers are like, \u0022Here\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do and you\u0027ll have to stop me.\u0022 But I\u0027m like, \u0022You know what? I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do.\u0022 That way, they don\u0027t know how to stop me.\u000A\u000AGQ: Tell me about a particular play from last season that you\u0027d use as an example of this chess game.\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  Week 3 versus the Redskins. Monday Night Football. It was a play with me and [fellow Cowboys outside linebacker] Anthony Spencer in the fourth quarter. All game, I kept going inside, going inside, going inside. Every time I\u0027d come inside, the quarterback, Rex Grossman, would boot outside of me and the tackle and just flip it over to his running back in the flat. So, it\u0027s the last play of the game. I said, \u0022Spencer, he\u0027s going to run out of the pocket outside of me. All I want you to do is run outside from your side and keep chasing him. Just run the loop. Run around your tackle and run really wide and keep chasing him.\u0022 I saw it. I knew what would happen. I\u0027d come inside and Grossman would go outside of me, looking to scramble and he\u0027d flip the ball off to his back like he\u0027d done the whole entire game. This time, though, Spencer would chase him down from behind.\u000A\u000AGQ: And?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  I come inside and Grossman rolls outside thinking, \u0022Well, I have a lot of time now. It\u0027s the last play of the game. I\u0027ve got a lot of time and I\u0027m going to make a play.\u0022 But on the other side of the field, Spencer\u0027s going all the way around his man. Grossman\u0027s running from me, but he doesn\u0027t see Spencer coming. Boom—blindside. Spencer makes the play. Strips him. We recover the fumble. Game over.\u000A\u000AGQ: Is that even more rewarding than being the guy who makes the hit?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  Oh, absolutely. I saw it! Just being on the same page, I told him what was going to happen and Spencer actually said, \u0022I\u0027m going to force the ball out. I\u0027m going to make him fumble.\u0022 He said that. Before the play. And it happened. We\u0027re like, \u0022Man, it worked!\u0022 And the key there was the mental, not the physical. We had to think. We had to see it. Chess game.\u000A\u000AGQ: Is there a quarterback you lose sleep over?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  No, but I think a guy that\u0027s very hard to prepare for is Michael Vick. He has a very good offensive line, and when you do get back there, it\u0027s a rabbit chase. You can\u0027t just catch him. You have to corral him. The cornerbacks can\u0027t even catch him. Another guy is Cam Newton. We play him this year. He\u0027s the same way. I\u0027ve talked to some of the pass rushers and they say he\u0027s very hard to take down. And boy, he\u0027s fast, too. He can run. And there\u0027s only room for improvement. His mental capacity is only going to improve.\u000A\u000AGQ: Your career nearly ended in 2009, during a game against San Diego. You went down with that neck injury and were lying on the carpet motionless. What were you thinking about at that moment?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  You never think that you\u0027ll be the guy who\u0027s on the stretcher. It\u0027s usually a special teams guy, because they have those big impact hits. But the guys on offense and defense, we don\u0027t have enough speed built up to have that impact. When I went down, everything just stopped. I thought, \u0022Why am I here?\u0022 I actually thought that my body was moving. I thought I was moving my arms, I thought I was moving my legs. But I wasn\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t move. Mentally, I was moving. But physically, I wasn\u0027t. I\u0027m sitting there, just thinking. I was thinking, \u0022I\u0027m that guy.\u0022 Everyone was watching me, just lying there, unable to do anything. I felt embarrassed, actually. They strapped me up, and I wasn\u0027t able to move my neck or arms or legs, but I said, \u0022I\u0027m alright. I\u0027m alright.\u0022 Then it finally hit me when they took my facemask off. When they took that facemask off, they took something out of me.\u000A\u000AGQ: You were no longer this warrior. You were human.\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  Yes. I still had my helmet on, but not my facemask. They were rolling me out on the stretcher, and I was sitting there, and I gave my thumbs up. I got into the ambulance and we rode to the hospital, and I was in so much pain. All those nerves. When I got to the hospital, they put me into the wheelchair and I had a big neck brace on and I took all the tests. All the strength tests, the MRIs. Everything was fine. I passed them all. They said, \u0022You can leave.\u0022 When I finally got home, I just was frozen. I was thinking, \u0022Do you realize what just happened?\u0022 Then my neck stopped hurting. Around four or five in the morning, I woke up and took my neck brace off. I came to the facility the next day without it on. Everyone was saying, \u0022What are you doing?!\u0022 I told them I felt all right. I felt good. I passed all the tests again. Everyone said, \u0022You\u0027re not going to play this week, are you?\u0022 And I said, \u0022I don\u0027t know\u0022.\u000A\u000AGQ: Because of the physical pain?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  No, because I was scared. I was so scared. I started thinking about my family. I thought, \u0022I might have to give football up.\u0022 I really thought I might have to retire, because I just couldn\u0027t imagine going through something so traumatic again.\u000A\u000AGQ: Who were you guys playing that next week?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  The Saints. They were 13-0, and I forget what our record was [9-5], but we needed the win. What was crazy was that up until kickoff, I didn\u0027t know if I was ever going to play football again. My head was screwed up. Then, the craziest thing happened. I walked into the Superdome and something just came over me. I put my helmet back on. I put that facemask back on. And I said, \u0022Okay, I think I\u0027m going to try it out.\u0022 Deon Henderson—he was our little bulldog, the guy who was always smashing people\u0027s heads, he pumped guys up before the game—I had him hit me, and I thought, \u0022Okay, my neck feels good.\u0022 Then, I looked at the team. And when I looked at the team, they all asked me, \u0022Are you going to play?\u0022 And I said, \u0022I don\u0027t know, guys.\u0022 I just went and prayed. I went up to Coach and I said, \u0022I can play on third downs.\u0022 I went out there on the first third down of the game, and they ran the ball and hit me. Now, the Saints don\u0027t ever run the ball on third down. They did that to get me. And you know what? That ticked me off. I was like, \u0022Oh, you guys want to try to hurt me again, don\u0027t you?\u0022 So then I told Coach to put me in on first downs. And then, second downs, too. And each play, I got more and more confidence about it.\u000A\u000AGQ: They pissed you off.\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  They did. But even after that game, I was still skeptical each week after that. I\u0027d have pain in my neck and it was a whirlwind that whole year. I feel good now, but it\u0027s a blessing.\u000A\u000AGQ: Have you ever heard any talk of bounties in the Cowboys locker room?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  You know what, if it\u0027s true, I\u0027ve never heard of anything like that. You might say, \u0022Hey man, if you cause this fumble—thousand bucks.\u0022 Or you\u0027ll say, \u0022Who\u0027s going to make the big play? Thousand bucks.\u0022 But when you start talking about another man\u0027s livelihood? No.\u000A\u000AGQ: I assume you heard the Greg Williams audio.\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  Have you ever heard anything as specific as that? No. I mean, I\u0027m a guy who got knocked out. I nearly broke my neck.\u000A\u000AGQ: Were you surprised none of the Saints players spoke out against Williams?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  [Laughs] Crazy. It\u0027s like if I told you that if you went out and knocked out this other reporter, you\u0027ll get the cover story. I\u0027ve never seen or heard anything like that before. We were all like, \u0022Hold up. What?\u0022 But you know, coaches talk. And just because coaches talk, you don\u0027t have to listen to it.\u000A\u000AGQ: Last year, you were fined $15,000 for a hit on Buffalo Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. How much did that fine bother you?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  I told the league: I\u0027ve got 99.5 sacks in my career—I don\u0027t remember a single time I\u0027ve ever rushed the quarterback and really \u0022roughed the passer.\u0022 So how are you guys going to fine me? Every single play, I\u0027m the guy that\u0027s singled out. It\u0027s me and that quarterback. If I really wanted to spear him, trust me, I can. I didn\u0027t hit him head-to-head. I could have exploded on him. I could have flipped him upside down if I wanted to. But you know what? I have respect for the game. I\u0027m not going to try to take him out of the game. So, they fined me, and I appealed it. And then it went away.\u000A\u000AGQ: I imagine it\u0027s hard to turn it on and off. You go out there trying to pursue the quarterback, but you can\u0027t be too violent or you\u0027ll be slapped with a fine. How do you manage that switch?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  It\u0027s always on. It has to be. If you try to play soft, you\u0027re going to get hurt. If you slow down for a second, Bam! If you\u0027re that guy they\u0027re going after, I can promise you—their motor\u0027s not going off.\u000A\u000AGQ: Does that carry over to the way they market you guys? Do you feel as though defensive players are demonized?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  If they want to put you in that circle, they\u0027ll put you in that circle. We don\u0027t get any breaks, man. That play in that game against the Bills—that\u0027s worth more than $15,000. If it\u0027s third-and-fifteen with two minutes left in the fourth quarter, and I don\u0027t hit that dude—I just gave him four more downs to score. And if they score? Trust me, that\u0027s worth a lot more than $15,000 to my team.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do segments like ESPN\u0027s \u0022Jacked Up\u0022, where the announcers hoot over big hits, bother you?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  Well, the guys that are getting \u0022jacked up\u0022 are usually defensive guys. Why don\u0027t the offensive guys get fined? When we get crack-backed, there are no fines. I\u0027m working one-on-one with a tackle, and a guy comes in on my legs and chops them—it could be career-ending. A little wide receiver comes in and Bam! Takes out your legs. But that\u0027s \u0022just part of the game,\u0022 because he\u0027s a little morsel. But some of these wide receivers are big dudes. Look at Calvin Johnson. But they let those plays go on, so the offense can score.\u000A\u000AGQ: After James Harrison was fined a ton of money for a hit last year, they sold the image of the tackle on the league\u0027s web site, NFL.com. Do you guys ever see that stuff and think it\u0027s ridiculous?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  [Laughs] I have no comment on that.\u000A\u000AGQ: Are there any guys that everyone recognizes as the \u0022dirty\u0022 players?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  You know, I really don\u0027t pay much attention to that. Because when I\u0027m out there, man, I don\u0027t care what you do. If you\u0027re going to be dirty, I\u0027m going to be dirty, too. And trust me, I\u0027m going to take everything out of the bag.\u000A\u000AGQ: What\u0027s that bag got in it?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  There are guys who want to cut your legs. So, what can the defensive player do as a response? You can power him and put him on his back. If you put an offensive tackle on his back—they\u0027re all big dudes—it\u0027s degrading. And then you just walk over him slowly. And you turn around and stare at him while he\u0027s on the ground. You just beat him up so bad, they know they did something wrong. They woke the beast.\u000A\u000AGQ: The beast?\u000A\u000A DeMarcus Ware:  Yeah, then they\u0027re like, \u0022Oh, shit,\u0022 because they know that every play, I\u0027m coming. I\u0027m not going to stop. At first, I\u0027ll smile at you. I won\u0027t say nothing to you. I\u0027ll just keep beating on you, and beating on you, and beating on you. And if you say something, I won\u0027t say anything back. I\u0027m just going to come back harder the next time. I\u0027m going to prove a point: \u0022You fucked with the wrong one. You wake the beast, you\u0027re going to get it.\u0022",

doesn&apos;t fit the profile of a guy who wrecks quarterbacks for a living. The Dallas Cowboys All-Pro linebacker&#x2014;one of the most feared pass rushers in the NFL&#x2014;is a brains-over-brawn kind of athlete, which is a scary thought when you&apos;re bringing the kind of brawn he&apos;s got. This is a strange time in the NFL to be a sack specialist, though: as most of them will tell you, the league slaps fines on guys for breathing too hard on a quarterback&#x2014;an unmistakable trend in the rules that often seems at odds with the sport&apos;s broader glorification of hard hits and jacked-up highlights. Ware spoke with <em>GQ</em> about the NFL&apos;s ambivalence toward violence, how he stays on the right side of the rules&#x2014;and the moment in his career when he was so scared that he didn&apos;t know if he could ever play again.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>GQ: Who were the pass rushers you grew up watching?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> The guy I really like is [Rams Hall of Famer] Deacon Jones. When I see Deacon Jones, we sit down and have <em>deep</em> conversations. We just talk about stuff.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>GQ: I met Deacon Jones once and five seconds into the conversation, he told me he once had fifty-five sacks in a season, before they officially kept track of sack totals.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> <em>[Laughs]</em> Of course he did. He&apos;s a great guy. Every time I see Deacon, I say, &quot;What&apos;s up?&quot; and right away he&apos;s telling me, &quot;You&apos;ve got to work on this,&quot; or, &quot;You&apos;ve got to work on that.&quot; He says, &quot;You&apos;ve got to try the head slap&quot; or &quot;You&apos;re not trash talking right. You&apos;re not a good trash talker.&quot; He is straight up. When he talks, he doesn&apos;t sugarcoat anything. He&apos;s going to tell you straight up what he thinks. And he&apos;s ready to get right back out there and play. Like, now.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>GQ: Is there a certain technique you&apos;ve mastered others haven&apos;t? Signature moves?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> I&apos;m the Emulator. I&apos;m a technician. Every week, I&apos;m going to have different moves based on the film I watch. I like revealing something totally different every Sunday. I&apos;ll get in the film room around 6 o&apos;clock in the morning. I&apos;ll watch, say, three hours a day all by myself. I chart who is effective and see what works. Then, whatever that offensive tackle wasn&apos;t good at? I make sure I&apos;m going to master it that whole week. I may even be uncomfortable with it, but I&apos;m going to do it. Because I&apos;m going to do all the negative things that you don&apos;t like. I&apos;m <em>going</em> to get in your head.  </p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>GQ: It&apos;s such a chess game, because they&apos;re spending <em>their</em> whole week studying your tape.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> It <em>is</em> a chess match, and you know what? I love to play it. I like to know whatever those guys are doing. When people ask me, &quot;How many moves do you have?&quot; I tell them, &quot;Unlimited.&quot; Because every day, it changes. Usually pass rushers are like, &quot;Here&apos;s what I&apos;m going to do and you&apos;ll have to stop me.&quot; But I&apos;m like, &quot;You know what? I don&apos;t know what I&apos;m going to do.&quot; That way, they don&apos;t know <em>how</em> to stop me.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>GQ: Tell me about a particular play from last season that you&apos;d use as an example of this chess game.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> Week 3 versus the Redskins. <em>Monday Night Football</em>. It was a play with me and [fellow Cowboys outside linebacker] Anthony Spencer in the fourth quarter. All game, I kept going inside, going inside, going inside. Every time I&apos;d come inside, the quarterback, Rex Grossman, would boot outside of me and the tackle and just flip it over to his running back in the flat. So, it&apos;s the last play of the game. I said, &quot;Spencer, he&apos;s going to run out of the pocket outside of me. All I want you to do is run outside from your side and keep chasing him. Just run the loop. Run around your tackle and run really wide and keep chasing him.&quot; I saw it. I knew what would happen. I&apos;d come inside and Grossman would go outside of me, looking to scramble and he&apos;d flip the ball off to his back like he&apos;d done the whole entire game. This time, though, Spencer would chase him down from behind.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>GQ: And?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> I come inside and Grossman rolls outside thinking, &quot;Well, I have a lot of time now. It&apos;s the last play of the game. I&apos;ve got a lot of time and I&apos;m going to make a play.&quot; But on the other side of the field, Spencer&apos;s going all the way around his man. Grossman&apos;s running from me, but he doesn&apos;t see Spencer coming. Boom&#x2014;blindside. Spencer makes the play. Strips him. We recover the fumble. Game over.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>GQ: Is that even more rewarding than being the guy who makes the hit?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> Oh, absolutely. I saw it! Just being on the same page, I told him what was going to happen and Spencer actually said, &quot;I&apos;m going to force the ball out. I&apos;m going to make him fumble.&quot; He said that. Before the play. And it happened. We&apos;re like, &quot;Man, it worked!&quot; And the key there was the mental, not the physical. We had to <em>think</em>. We had to see it. Chess game.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>GQ: Is there a quarterback you lose sleep over?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> No, but I think a guy that&apos;s very hard to prepare for is Michael Vick. He has a very good offensive line, and when you <em>do</em> get back there, it&apos;s a rabbit chase. You can&apos;t just catch him. You have to corral him. The cornerbacks can&apos;t even catch him. Another guy is Cam Newton. We play him this year. He&apos;s the same way. I&apos;ve talked to some of the pass rushers and they say he&apos;s very hard to take down. And boy, he&apos;s fast, too. He can run. And there&apos;s only room for improvement. His mental capacity is only going to improve.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>GQ: Your career nearly ended in 2009, during a game against San Diego. You went down with that neck injury and were lying on the carpet motionless. What were you thinking about at that moment?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> You never think that you&apos;ll be the guy who&apos;s on the stretcher. It&apos;s usually a special teams guy, because they have those big impact hits. But the guys on offense and defense, we don&apos;t have enough speed built up to have that impact. When I went down, everything just stopped. I thought, &quot;Why am I here?&quot; I actually thought that my body was moving. I thought I was moving my arms, I thought I was moving my legs. But I wasn&apos;t. I couldn&apos;t move. Mentally, I was moving. But physically, I wasn&apos;t. I&apos;m sitting there, just thinking. I was thinking, &quot;I&apos;m that guy.&quot; Everyone was watching me, just lying there, unable to do anything. I felt embarrassed, actually. They strapped me up, and I wasn&apos;t able to move my neck or arms or legs, but I said, &quot;I&apos;m alright. I&apos;m alright.&quot; Then it finally hit me when they took my facemask off. When they took that facemask off, they took something <em>out</em> of me.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>GQ: You were no longer this warrior. You were human.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> Yes. I still had my helmet on, but not my facemask. They were rolling me out on the stretcher, and I was sitting there, and I gave my thumbs up. I got into the ambulance and we rode to the hospital, and I was in so much pain. All those nerves. When I got to the hospital, they put me into the wheelchair and I had a big neck brace on and I took all the tests. All the strength tests, the MRIs. Everything was fine. I passed them all. They said, &quot;You can leave.&quot; When I finally got home, I just was frozen. I was thinking, &quot;Do you realize what just happened?&quot; Then my neck stopped hurting. Around four or five in the morning, I woke up and took my neck brace off. I came to the facility the next day without it on. Everyone was saying, &quot;What are you doing?!&quot; I told them I felt all right. I felt good. I passed all the tests again. Everyone said, &quot;You&apos;re not going to play this week, are you?&quot; And I said, &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot;.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>GQ: Because of the physical pain?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> No, because I was scared. I was so scared. I started thinking about my family. I thought, &quot;I might have to give football up.&quot; I really thought I might have to retire, because I just couldn&apos;t imagine going through something so traumatic again.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>GQ: Who were you guys playing that next week?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> The Saints. They were 13-0, and I forget what our record was [9-5], but we needed the win. What was crazy was that up until kickoff, I didn&apos;t know if I was ever going to play football again. My head was screwed up. Then, the craziest thing happened. I walked into the Superdome and something just came over me. I put my helmet back on. I put that facemask back on. And I said, &quot;Okay, I think I&apos;m going to try it out.&quot; Deon Henderson&#x2014;he was our little bulldog, the guy who was always smashing people&apos;s heads, he pumped guys up before the game&#x2014;I had him hit me, and I thought, &quot;Okay, my neck feels good.&quot; Then, I looked at the team. And when I looked at the team, they all asked me, &quot;Are you going to play?&quot; And I said, &quot;I don&apos;t know, guys.&quot; I just went and prayed. I went up to Coach and I said, &quot;I can play on third downs.&quot; I went out there on the first third down of the game, and they ran the ball and hit me. Now, the Saints don&apos;t ever run the ball on third down. They did that to get me. And you know what? That ticked me off. I was like, &quot;Oh, you guys want to try to hurt me again, don&apos;t you?&quot; So then I told Coach to put me in on first downs. And then, second downs, too. And each play, I got more and more confidence about it.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>GQ: They pissed you off.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> They did.

We were all like, &quot;Hold up. What?&quot; But you know, coaches talk. And just because coaches talk, you don&apos;t have to listen to it.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong>GQ: Last year, you were fined $15,000 for a hit on Buffalo Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. How much did that fine bother you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> I told the league: I&apos;ve got 99.5 sacks in my career&#x2014;I don&apos;t remember a single time I&apos;ve ever rushed the quarterback and really &quot;roughed the passer.&quot; So how are you guys going to fine me? Every single play, I&apos;m the guy that&apos;s singled out. It&apos;s me and that quarterback. If I really wanted to spear him, trust me, I can. I didn&apos;t hit him head-to-head. I could have exploded on him. I could have flipped him upside down if I wanted to. But you know what? I have respect for the game. I&apos;m not going to try to take him out of the game. So, they fined me, and I appealed it. And then it went away.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.12"><strong>GQ: I imagine it&apos;s hard to turn it on and off. You go out there trying to pursue the quarterback, but you can&apos;t be too violent or you&apos;ll be slapped with a fine. How do you manage that switch?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> It&apos;s always on. It has to be. If you try to play soft, you&apos;re going to get hurt. If you slow down for a second, Bam! If you&apos;re that guy they&apos;re going after, I can promise you&#x2014;<em>their</em> motor&apos;s not going off.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.14"><strong>GQ: Does that carry over to the way they market you guys? Do you feel as though defensive players are demonized?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> If they want to put you in that circle, they&apos;ll put you in that circle. We don&apos;t get any breaks, man. That play in that game against the Bills&#x2014;that&apos;s worth more than $15,000. If it&apos;s third-and-fifteen with two minutes left in the fourth quarter, and I don&apos;t hit that dude&#x2014;I just gave him four more downs to score. And if they score? Trust me, that&apos;s worth a lot more than $15,000 to my team.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.16"><strong>GQ: Do segments like ESPN&apos;s &quot;Jacked Up&quot;, where the announcers hoot over big hits, bother you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.17"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> Well, the guys that are getting &quot;jacked up&quot; are usually defensive guys. Why don&apos;t the offensive guys get fined? When we get crack-backed, there are no fines. I&apos;m working one-on-one with a tackle, and a guy comes in on my legs and chops them&#x2014;it could be career-ending. A little wide receiver comes in and <em>Bam!</em> Takes out your legs. But that&apos;s &quot;just part of the game,&quot; because he&apos;s a little morsel. But some of these wide receivers are big dudes. Look at Calvin Johnson. But they let those plays go on, so the offense can score.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.18"><strong>GQ: After James Harrison was fined a ton of money for a hit last year, they sold the image of the tackle on the league&apos;s web site, NFL.com. Do you guys ever see that stuff and think it&apos;s ridiculous?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.19"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> <em>[Laughs] </em>I have no comment on that.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.1a"><strong>GQ: Are there any guys that everyone recognizes as the &quot;dirty&quot; players?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> You know, I really don&apos;t pay much attention to that. Because when I&apos;m out there, man, I don&apos;t care what you do. If you&apos;re going to be dirty, I&apos;m going to be dirty, too. And trust me, I&apos;m going to take everything out of the bag.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><strong>GQ: What&apos;s that bag got in it?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> There are guys who want to cut your legs. So, what can the defensive player do as a response? You can power him and put him on his back. If you put an offensive tackle on his back&#x2014;they&apos;re all big dudes&#x2014;it&apos;s degrading. And then you just walk over him slowly. And you turn around and stare at him while he&apos;s on the ground. You just beat him up so bad, they know they did something wrong. They woke the beast.</p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><strong>GQ: The beast?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".27onw2tuiv4.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><strong> DeMarcus Ware: </strong> Yeah, then they&apos;re like, &quot;Oh, shit,&quot; because they know that every play, I&apos;m coming. I&apos;m not going to stop. At first, I&apos;ll smile at you. I won&apos;t say nothing to you. I&apos;ll just keep beating on you, and beating on you, and beating on you. And if you say something, I won&apos;t say anything back. I&apos;m just going to come back harder the next time. I&apos;m going to prove a point: &quot;You fucked with the wrong one.
