  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestGetty Images\u000A\u000AThe NBA\u0027s regular season has come to a close and by the time you read this, we\u0027ll already be in the thick of our opening round playoff series against Dallas. For this column I decided to ask people on Twitter to come up with questions they would like answered, and I chose a few of the best to write about. Here we go\u000A\u000A@asdeaton what are the best and worst parts of playing in the nba?\u000A\u000AThis is a great job. Basketball is fun. The money is great. You get paid to do something you love. I love that I get time off in the summer. I really enjoy traveling to all the cities we play in. I try to get out and see something everywhere we go.\u000A\u000AMy favorite part is the camaraderie and friendships you develop being on a team. It\u0027s really a unique workplace. With practice, games, pregame work, weights, travel, appearances, film sessions, recovery and the hour a day spent bullshitting in the locker room, we spend more time with the team then we do with our families or friends. Your teammate\u0027s weird lives are like your own weird life, so you can relate to each other. The ongoing jokes, the dinners, the flights and the arguments are what I think I will miss most when I\u0027m done playing. Also, it\u0027s such a diverse group of people. I grew up in Iowa, and the guys I spend all my time with are from places like Washington D.C., L.A., The Congo and Chicago. Guys come from different backgrounds, grew up with different family situations, and have different personalities, yet we get along and have a lot of fun. Royal Ivey, who has become one of my closest friends, and I have talked about getting a couple of buddies from home and taking an RV on the first-ever road trip from Iowa Falls, Iowa (population 5,137) to Queens, New York to visit our home towns. I\u0027ll be sure to bring a video camera.\u000A\u000APlaying in the NBA is a great gig and a lot of fun, but it does present challenges that can be difficult to cope with. For instance, injuries suck. It seems like there is always some minor ache. The worst injuries are the ones that affect how you play. It\u0027s frustrating to not be able to move or jump like you are capable of, and it\u0027s annoying to constantly feel that pain. I\u0027ve had two shoulder surgeries and a knee surgery. Coming back from a surgery requires day after day of monotonous rehab. It\u0027s frustrating to put in so much time and work just to get back to where you were before surgery.\u000A\u000AHaving a lot of money for the first time can cause some issues. There are players who have lost friendships and had family relationships strained because of money. The money changes how people treat them, and all of a sudden instead of being family or a friend, they become an ATM. There are a lot of guys in the league who constantly feel the weight of taking care of people back home.\u000A\u000ABeing in the NBA can be tough on marriages and families. It is hard to be away your kids so much. When you miss your child\u0027s Christmas program or a birthday, it bothers you. To everyone else, your road game against the Spurs seems like a really big deal, but your kid only knows her Dad couldn\u0027t make it to her soccer game, even though he really wishes he could be there. I\u0027ve been told around 80% of NBA marriages end in divorce. Every divorced couple has their own reasons why the marriage didn\u0027t work, but this career definitely adds some obstacles.\u000A\u000AWhatever path you take in life will present its own challenges, and playing in the NBA is no different.\u000A\u000A@BriceDick you look like a hairy guy. On a scale of 1-10, how hairy is your chest? Be honest.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A@PaulMSPYYZ How do you make the most of your in-transit down time while traveling during the season?\u000A\u000AOn the plane, I like to watch TV series on DVD. I love it when I\u0027m behind multiple seasons, so I can burn through all the episodes back-to-back. I have watched every episode of The Sopranos, The Wire, Friday Night Lights, and Breaking Bad this way. I like trying to introduce different guys to shows I think they might like. I try to put everyone on to watching Breaking Bad, and have gotten a couple of guys into it. I got Shaun Livingston to become a Curb Your Enthusiasm fan. Byron Mullens and I used to watch Sons of Anarchy. I\u0027m pushing Mad Men on a couple of guys now, but so far nobody has gotten into it.\u000A\u000A@ThunderAddict When taking a charge how do you absorb the hit by the player and prepare your body for impact of the floor?\u000A\u000ATaking a charge is all about anticipation and seeing a drive coming. You can usually tell if a guy is going to try to get all the way to the basket. When you see them make their move, you have to get outside the charge circle as quickly as possible. Despite what the rulebook says, I feel like referees are more likely to give you the call based on where you get hit rather than if you are totally set. If you slide over a little, but the offensive player runs into the middle of your chest, you are more likely to get the call then if you are perfectly still but the guy slides around you and hits you on the side. I usually flex my powerful ab muscles and my chest to brace for the collision, then when I get hit and fall, I try to push off my heels and slide back, as opposed to letting my back go straight into the floor. It usually doesn\u0027t hurt. Every once in a while you bang knees or get hit in the family jewels, but not often.\u000A\u000A@dhodgs How did it feel when you and your teammates were forced to leave Seattle and move to OKC?\u000A\u000AIn 2008, I was a member of the Seattle Supersonics and we were relocated to Oklahoma City. I really have enjoyed playing in both cities, so I\u0027ll leave it at that. I have never been traded in my nine years in the NBA, but that experience felt like a trade, and it showed me that the NBA and professional sports are a business. We hear that phrase all the time from athletes when they leave a team via free agency or from management when they trade a player, and it\u0027s become a clich&amp;#xC3;&amp;#xA9;. Still, for me the experience was a good lesson to learn about how this business works.\u000A\u000A@IamAinsleyHayes Which teammates would survive a zombie apocalypse, and which ones wouldn\u0027t?\u000A\u000AI think most of us would. We are used to running and pushing through fatigue. We are used to being in stressful situations together, and we have each others\u0027 backs. Sadly, however, I think we would lose a couple guys. Take, for instance, Reggie Jackson, our rookie, who cannot seem to stay awake for any extended period of time and passes out on all flights within five minutes, as he did here with Serge Ibaka and Cole Aldrich.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI fear Reggie would doze off somewhere and the zombies would get to him. I think Kendrick Perkins would be OK at first, but eventually he would look at a zombie and not like the way the zombie was looking at him. If you know Perk the way I know Perk, you know he wouldn\u0027t be able to resist getting face to face with the zombie and letting him know he doesn\u0027t play. He could fight off a few of the zombies, but eventually there would be too many, and I\u0027m worried he wouldn\u0027t make it. Meanwhile, James Harden would definitely survive, because a zombie is not going to want to get any of that beard in his throat while trying to eat his brain.\u000A\u000A--Nick Collison\u000A\u000ACollison, 31, is a power forward for the Oklahoma City Thunder and GQ\u0027s guest blogger for this NBA season.

thick of our opening round playoff series against Dallas. For this column I decided to ask people on Twitter to come up with questions they would like answered, and I chose a few of the best to write about. Here we go</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>@asdeaton <em>what are the best and worst parts of playing in the nba?</em></strong></p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.3">This is a great job. Basketball is fun. The money is great. You get paid to do something you love. I love that I get time off in the summer. I really enjoy traveling to all the cities we play in. I try to get out and see something everywhere we go.</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.5">My favorite part is the camaraderie and friendships you develop being on a team. It&#x2019;s really a unique workplace. With practice, games, pregame work, weights, travel, appearances, film sessions, recovery and the hour a day spent bullshitting in the locker room, we spend more time with the team then we do with our families or friends. Your teammate&#x2019;s weird lives are like your own weird life, so you can relate to each other. The ongoing jokes, the dinners, the flights and the arguments are what I think I will miss most when I&#x2019;m done playing. Also, it&#x2019;s such a diverse group of people. I grew up in Iowa, and the guys I spend all my time with are from places like Washington D.C., L.A., The Congo and Chicago. Guys come from different backgrounds, grew up with different family situations, and have different personalities, yet we get along and have a lot of fun. Royal Ivey, who has become one of my closest friends, and I have talked about getting a couple of buddies from home and taking an RV on the first-ever road trip from Iowa Falls, Iowa (population 5,137) to Queens, New York to visit our home towns. I&#x2019;ll be sure to bring a video camera.</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.6">Playing in the NBA is a great gig and a lot of fun, but it does present challenges that can be difficult to cope with. For instance, injuries suck. It seems like there is always some minor ache. The worst injuries are the ones that affect how you play. It&#x2019;s frustrating to not be able to move or jump like you are capable of, and it&#x2019;s annoying to constantly feel that pain. I&#x2019;ve had two shoulder surgeries and a knee surgery. Coming back from a surgery requires day after day of monotonous rehab. It&#x2019;s frustrating to put in so much time and work just to get back to where you were before surgery.</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.7">Having a lot of money for the first time can cause some issues. There are players who have lost friendships and had family relationships strained because of money. The money changes how people treat them, and all of a sudden instead of being family or a friend, they become an ATM. There are a lot of guys in the league who constantly feel the weight of taking care of people back home.</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.8">Being in the NBA can be tough on marriages and families. It is hard to be away your kids so much. When you miss your child&#x2019;s Christmas program or a birthday, it bothers you. To everyone else, your road game against the Spurs seems like a really big deal, but your kid only knows her Dad couldn&#x2019;t make it to her soccer game, even though he really wishes he could be there. I&#x2019;ve been told around 80% of NBA marriages end in divorce. Every divorced couple has their own reasons why the marriage didn&#x2019;t work, but this career definitely adds some obstacles.</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.9">Whatever path you take in life will present its own challenges, and playing in the NBA is no different.</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>@BriceDick <em>you look like a hairy guy.

I love it when I&#x2019;m behind multiple seasons, so I can burn through all the episodes back-to-back. I have watched every episode of <em>The Sopranos</em>, <em>The Wire</em>, <em>Friday Night Lights</em>, and <em>Breaking Bad</em> this way. I like trying to introduce different guys to shows I think they might like. I try to put everyone on to watching <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and have gotten a couple of guys into it. I got Shaun Livingston to become a <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> fan. Byron Mullens and I used to watch <em>Sons of Anarchy</em>. I&#x2019;m pushing <em>Mad Men</em> on a couple of guys now, but so far nobody has gotten into it.</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>@ThunderAddict <em>When taking a charge how do you absorb the hit by the player and prepare your body for impact of the floor?</em></strong></p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.f">Taking a charge is all about anticipation and seeing a drive coming. You can usually tell if a guy is going to try to get all the way to the basket. When you see them make their move, you have to get outside the charge circle as quickly as possible. Despite what the rulebook says, I feel like referees are more likely to give you the call based on where you get hit rather than if you are totally set. If you slide over a little, but the offensive player runs into the middle of your chest, you are more likely to get the call then if you are perfectly still but the guy slides around you and hits you on the side. I usually flex my powerful ab muscles and my chest to brace for the collision, then when I get hit and fall, I try to push off my heels and slide back, as opposed to letting my back go straight into the floor. It usually doesn&#x2019;t hurt. Every once in a while you bang knees or get hit in the family jewels, but not often.</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>@dhodgs <em>How did it feel when you and your teammates were forced to leave Seattle and move to OKC?</em></strong></p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.h">In 2008, I was a member of the Seattle Supersonics and we were relocated to Oklahoma City. I really have enjoyed playing in both cities, so I&#x2019;ll leave it at that. I have never been traded in my nine years in the NBA, but that experience felt like a trade, and it showed me that the NBA and professional sports are a business. We hear that phrase all the time from athletes when they leave a team via free agency or from management when they trade a player, and it&#x2019;s become a clich&amp;#xC3;&amp;#xA9;. Still, for me the experience was a good lesson to learn about how this business works.</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>@IamAinsleyHayes <em>Which teammates would survive a zombie apocalypse, and which ones wouldn&#x2019;t?</em></strong></p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.j">I think most of us would. We are used to running and pushing through fatigue. We are used to being in stressful situations together, and we have each others&#x2019; backs. Sadly, however, I think we would lose a couple guys. Take, for instance, Reggie Jackson, our rookie, who cannot seem to stay awake for any extended period of time and passes out on all flights within five minutes, as he did here with Serge Ibaka and Cole Aldrich.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.k"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582977d1177d66d68d55d93/master/w_806/blogs-the-q-reggie.jpg" alt="blogs-the-q-reggie.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-nick-collison-guest-blog-vol-6-nicks-playoff-mailbag&amp;t=blogs-the-q-reggie.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-nick-collison-guest-blog-vol-6-nicks-playoff-mailbag&amp;t=blogs-the-q-reggie.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-nick-collison-guest-blog-vol-6-nicks-playoff-mailbag&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582977d1177d66d68d55d93%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-q-reggie.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-q-reggie.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-nick-collison-guest-blog-vol-6-nicks-playoff-mailbag&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582977d1177d66d68d55d93%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-q-reggie.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-q-reggie.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.l">I fear Reggie would doze off somewhere and the zombies would get to him. I think Kendrick Perkins would be OK at first, but eventually he would look at a zombie and not like the way the zombie was looking at him. If you know Perk the way I know Perk, you know he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to resist getting face to face with the zombie and letting him know he doesn&#x2019;t play. He could fight off a few of the zombies, but eventually there would be too many, and I&#x2019;m worried he wouldn&#x2019;t make it. Meanwhile, James Harden would definitely survive, because a zombie is not going to want to get any of that beard in his throat while trying to eat his brain.</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.m">--Nick Collison</p><p data-reactid=".i9mpmxtmgw.1.1.0.0.4.n">Collison, 31, is a power forward for the Oklahoma City Thunder and GQ&#x2019;s guest blogger for this NBA season.
