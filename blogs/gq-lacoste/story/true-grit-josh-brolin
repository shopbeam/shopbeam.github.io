He was also the star of Jonah Hex, but we won\u0027t hold that against him.\u000A\u000A You postponed this interview so you could spend the morning surfing, because you\u0027d heard the surf was good today. How was it?\u000A\u000A The ocean was cold, refreshing, but with no surf.\u000A\u000A Oh, so you were lied to. You were deceived.\u000A\u000A I was deceived [laughs]. I was sorely deceived. I went out with a couple buddies, and we were told it was going to be great. But you know what? Honestly, it sounds so lame, but just to get out in the ocean is almost enough, sometimes.\u000A\u000A A bad day surfing is better than a good day doing many other things.\u000A\u000A Exactly, right. I\u0027ve been trying to do more and more, just to equalize a bit, because I get so into manic work mode that I forget to do all those things that you\u0027re supposed to do to utilize this money that you\u0027re making.\u000A\u000A Your leisure time that you bought, with your hard work and sweat.\u000A\u000A Exactly. Actors are always saying, y\u0027know, \u0022I tried to read the script. I just got so much that I\u0027m doing right now, man.\u0022 In reality, actors probably do less than anybody else on the planet. [laughs]\u000A\u000A People weren\u0027t happy that we used a shot of you smoking a cigarette on the cover. We got letters.\u000A\u000A I heard, I heard. And you know, what\u0027s funny is, there was a conscious choice during that shoot that we weren\u0027t going to smoke during the shoot. So that was a pre-photograph. That was a test photograph, as we were waiting to do a real photograph, and that\u0027s the photograph they used. But it\u0027s all good.\u000A\u000A It made for a good cover.\u000A\u000A Good cover—and understandably, people were upset. But I wonder if it does lead to anybody smoking in the end. I hope not.\u000A\u000A What made you pick start smoking again?\u000A\u000A You know, it\u0027s the lamest excuse ever, and hopefully it won\u0027t last for long, but I went to Cannes. I had two movies at Cannes. And I got there, and it was just one of those things—nerves, whatever it was, a mask, a veil—and I thought, \u0022Well, y\u0027know, I\u0027ll have a couple cigarettes and that\u0027ll be it. I\u0027m going on a trip\u0022—my wife and I went on a trip after that—\u0022and then I\u0027ll make sure not to smoke on that trip.\u0022 And then, forget it. I mean, once I had two cigarettes, that was it. I bought a truckload and made sure to carry it in the trunk.\u000A\u000A Back up the forklift.\u000A\u000A Yeah, pretty much. And I hate it, I really do. I don\u0027t like it at all.\u000A\u000A You had a window where you saw what it was like to not smoke. You were a different man, for a while.\u000A\u000A It wasn\u0027t the first thought. That was the biggest thing. You start to realize—it\u0027s something you\u0027re not conscious of when you\u0027re smoking, but when you stop smoking, you realize that it\u0027s not the first thought. I was smoking in Indonesia. We went on this surf trip, me and this buddy of mine that I was just with this morning, we went on a surf trip to Indonesia. Not only was I kind of rotund from having done Woody Allen\u0027s movie, but I was winded, also, because of the smoking. So you know, I was the KFC guy [laughs]. Hi guys! Everybody looks hot and they\u0027re just like all cut up and in shape and getting ready to surf, and then there\u0027s me, you know, looking more like a buoy.\u000A\u000A You looked like shark bait.\u000A\u000A Exactly. \u0022Nail the dude that smells like KFC.\u0022\u000A\u000A So this package is really just an excuse for us to talk to a bunch of actors we actually kind of like, as opposed to people who have things to promote, necessarily.\u000A\u000A The key word is \u0022kind of.\u0022 A bunch of actors that we kind of like. Or we think we like, but we\u0027re never quite sure. I like that. I don\u0027t want to be involved in the portfolio that has to do with the actors that we love. I like the actors that we kind of like. That makes me feel much more comfortable in this interview.\u000A\u000A You\u0027re in here with some heavy dudes. Duvall\u0027s in here.\u000A\u000A I know! Duvall, whom I know well. And my grand favorite—I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s more than Duvall, cause I really love him, but: Harry Dean. Harry Dean, whose pictures I saw when I showed up for the photo shoot, who looks fantastic, who brought his Spanish guitar and his little hat, his little cowboy hat. And he was singing them tunes. I\u0027ve never heard him sing. My wife has. I\u0027ve only heard him sing on the soundtrack for Paris, Texas, which is an amazing song, a Spanish song, that he sings on that soundtrack. It\u0027s incredible. But I know he\u0027s a virtuoso for sure, when it comes to Spanish-speaking songs.\u000A\u000A Do you know him through Sean Penn, or—\u000A\u000A I know him slightly through Sean. I know that there was a moment when I was about 19 and Sean was like 25, 26, that I actually was desperate to just make my mark as an actor, or in any way, really. And I saw he and Harry Dean, out at Barney\u0027s Beanery, of course. Back then—this was like the \u002780s, I think. Some point in the \u002780s. I think I was doing that series Private Eye, so I had a pompadour at the time. And it was around the time that The Color of Money came out. I was playing pool, and it looked like I was trying to do my own rendition of what success might like, which was Tom Cruise in Color of Money. It was like I had a sign on my back that just said \u0022Beat me up, now.\u0022 And I think Sean threw out a few comments based on that. That was before I knew him. But yeah, that\u0027s really my only run-in with him. With the exception of—there was one time, at a restaurant. I sat at the table with him, and I don\u0027t know if he remembers it or not, Harry Dean, but—yeah, well, he consumed. Just say that, consumed. But I don\u0027t really have any close ties with him. I wish I did. The closest ties I have with him are once-removed, and that\u0027s through the movie that I love so much, Paris, Texas. I\u0027ve probably seen that movie 20 times, if not more. I just love it. Love it.\u000A\u000A Great soundtrack, too.\u000A\u000A Amazing soundtrack by Ry Cooder. I asked Bob Dylan to do The People Speak, and luckily he had seen No Country or something and was really smitten with that movie, so we were able to communicate, kind of, via that. So we went down to Malibu, where Bob was cool with doing it, and we had some cameras and some recording equipment and all that. And Bob came down there, and then in walks this other guy. And I\u0027m like, \u0022Fuck, why does that guy look so familiar?\u0022 Bob had just decided he\u0027d bring Ry Cooder along, you know, to back him up during \u0022Do Re Mi\u0022 and one other song. I think he did two songs, maybe three. My mind was completely blown, having no idea, really, how to deal with this duo. Cause it\u0027s just amazing. Just the history involved, and the juggling that they\u0027ve done. \u0022Okay, now we\u0027ve done this. Now what should we do?\u0022 \u0022I don\u0027t know, let\u0027s take all our talents and kind of throw them in the air and see where it lands.\u0022 And then that turns out to be brilliant, and they\u0027re like, \u0022Okay, let\u0027s do it again and bring somebody else in and see what happens.\u0022 It was just an amazing experience to be able to watch them do their thing.\u000A\u000A What was their rapport like? Did they communicate verbally?\u000A\u000A It was very unverbal. Nonverbal communication. Just a real laconic understanding. More of a tilt of the head, or an index-finger communication. They were rehearsing, and they just got into this groove. After a few of those finger communications, or, y\u0027know, glances at each other, they just got into a groove that was mind-blowing to me. I mean, it really was. It was like other-worldly, you know. And I know, with Bob, from what I\u0027ve heard, it\u0027s like he\u0027s always great. But then it just went into this other place. And you understand why he\u0027s Bob Dylan, and still around, playing as well as he is, and respected as much as he is. We were just sitting there with our jaws down to the floor, going, \u0022How are they—what is that extra thing?\u0022\u000A\u000A There\u0027s some kind of fourth dimension that people like that get into.\u000A\u000A There really is. It was really something. I\u0027d never really experienced it. I experienced it with Eddie Vedder. That was another time. Where he was playing \u0022Masters of War\u0022 and he almost became rabid while he was singing it. There was something that happened there during that song, that, again, he reached this place that separates them from the norm. From the typical, the common geniuses.\u000A\u000A Right. Your run-of-the-mill geniuses. Did you get to talk to Dylan at all? Does he make small talk?\u000A\u000A There was a little small talk. There was a little movie small talk, there was a little music small talk. I don\u0027t really…yeah. We\u0027ve spoken. And it\u0027s, you know, there was nothing other than just kind of brotherly sweetness about it, you know. But I do remember that after that whole thing happened, we didn\u0027t speak a lot. It\u0027s not like we got to know each other really well. But we had enough communication to say that we know each other somewhat.\u000A\u000A And there\u0027s a buddy of mine who was involved in The People Speak, [director] Anthony Arnove. I was in New York. I don\u0027t know what I was doing, I was doing something, working. And he said, \u0022Do you want to come up and see Dylan with me?\u0022 I think it was in Washington Heights. Up at this amazing theater. Amazing. It used to be a church and they converted it. But anyway, I said, yeah, I would love to. So he had these seats that were kind of, you know, halfway back on the left side of the aisle. And we went, and I guess somebody had told Bob that we were there, they ran up to us in our seats halfway through the gig and said, \u0022Bob would love to see you backstage. Maybe two songs before he ends, you can go backstage.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd so, my buddy Anthony, who\u0027s seen him probably 60 times, said, \u0022Listen\u0022—he felt like he had some inside information, from just seeing him so many times, and studying like he has—\u0022what Bob does after a show is, he runs out. He runs to his bus and he doesn\u0027t really stop and say hello. He doesn\u0027t have a full conversation. But what he likes to do is, he doesn\u0027t like to shake hands or anything, so just put your fist out there. He likes to fist bump.\u0022\u000A\u000AI was like, \u0022really?\u0022 He said, \u0022Yeah. It\u0027s just a fist bump. And it\u0027s kind of common knowledge now, for anybody who\u0027s been backstage.\u0022 And I was like, \u0022Oh.\u0022 So we go backstage, and he finishes the last two songs, and he steps off for a second and we didn\u0027t say anything to him. And then he went back on stage and did an encore. An amazing encore. And then, finally, he left and you could tell that was it. And then Bob was coming our way, headed outside. You know, it was kind of dark. So I had my fist up there high, where he could see it. I don\u0027t know if Anthony did, but I wanted to be respectful. I guess if you\u0027re into fist bumping, that\u0027s the thing to do. So Bob comes and he sees me and I go, \u0022Hey, man.\u0022 And I had my fist up there, like, \u0022I\u0027m ready.\u0022 And he gave me this huge hug. This huge hug. He was like, \u0022Josh, oh my God, I\u0027m so glad you made it. How are you? Thank you so much for allowing me to be a part of The People Speak. You know, I saw it and it really came out well. And I\u0027m just so proud to be a part of it, and thanks man.\u0022 I didn\u0027t know what was happening. And I said, \u0022You remember my friend Anthony?\u0022 And he\u0027s like, \u0022Yeah, yeah.\u0022 And Anthony\u0027s sitting there with his fist up in the air, waiting to be bumped. But that never happened.\u000A\u000A Do you find yourself looking to guys like that for lessons? About longevity, how to sustain your creativity in a long-haul career, stuff like that?\u000A\u000A Y\u0027know, it\u0027s like what I said, about throwing things up in the air and then seeing how they land and saying \u0022Let\u0027s try that.\u0022 I think there\u0027s a little more strategy to it than that, but they keep mixing it up. And there\u0027s integrity behind what they do. They seem to stick—all of \u0027em—seem to stick with something very personal. Eddie\u0027s the same way. Dealing with these people—they all seem to have a real respect for their own personal sensibilities. Not an arrogance, just a respect. They just know, like, \u0022If I do that other thing, I\u0027ll probably start feeling really shitty and I\u0027m kind of tired of that.\u0022 And it\u0027s important to be respectful of the fans. I mean, look at what Eddie did with Ticketmaster, y\u0027know. That was a moment where I said, \u0022God, I have so much fucking respect for that band.\u0022 It wasn\u0027t them going head-to-head with a big corporation just to say, \u0022Hey, look, we\u0027re real artists, we\u0027re going to go up against a big corporation just to make a point.\u0022 It was a very specific thing, always, with the fans in mind. I really think that was the intention. Like, when we were kids and we wanted to go see our favorite band, there was no reason we couldn\u0027t pay $28 to go see them. It wasn\u0027t like, \u0022Okay, I\u0027ll work for a month so I can go out one night and see this band that I love.\u0022 I have a lot of respect for that.\u000A\u000AI remember when they were actually playing off-the-beaten-track places, like state fairgrounds and stuff like that, just to get around the whole Ticketmaster monolith. I don\u0027t know if they really changed anything, but they at least demonstrated that it was possible to cut those guys out of the process. Exactly, exactly. And why not? \u0022Oh, we can\u0027t do that now because we\u0027re too big and it will make it seem like we\u0027re losing our edge, or that we\u0027re not as popular as we used to be, so therefore we can\u0027t play lesser venues or smaller venues.\u0022 That doesn\u0027t seem to be the case with them. They seem to continue to do what they want. So, what I think you may be asking, ultimately, is how does that affect me? Yes. I try and do the same thing, with that lesson in mind. It doesn\u0027t just come out of my own intelligence, for sure.\u000A\u000A Trying to mix it up, you mean?\u000A\u000A Trying to mix it up, and then also realizing that a good part is just a good part. And if I\u0027m going to do True Grit, it may not be a huge part, but it\u0027s an integral part for great filmmakers who I love, who I love as people, first and foremost, and that I love as artists, absolutely. And you know, I did that thing Jonah Hex recently, which I think we all had the best intentions for. I think that movie could have been a really, really fun and great movie. But y\u0027know, that\u0027s what happens when you go outside of that trajectory and you go \u0022Okay, let\u0027s mix it up, and let\u0027s give a new [director] a break and see what happens. Somebody who seems to have a lot of energy and a lot of creativity.\u0022 It was just a bad call on my part.\u000A\u000A Since you brought it up—what do you think went wrong there, with Jonah Hex? What was the biggest problem?\u000A\u000A The biggest problem initially?\u000A\u000A Sure.\u000A\u000A I think there was a guy who presented himself as one thing and turned out to be something else. I think that was the biggest problem, and I think I can say that with total confidence. There\u0027s people who you might not think are professional, you know, or who you think might be a problem on the set. And then they get on the set—I\u0027m just talking generally now—you get on the set, and you\u0027re like, \u0022Wow, this person really cares about what they\u0027re doing.\u0022 However they come off publicly is one thing, but then you see them on the set—I\u0027m talking about people I\u0027ve worked with, really wonderful actors—and you go, \u0022God, man, they\u0027re not only respectful of other people, but they\u0027re respectful of the process and they\u0027re workhorses. They go out there and when they decide to do a job, they really lend themselves to it absolutely and entirely, you know.\u0022 And even if you\u0027re having fun within what you\u0027re doing, it\u0027s the conviction level is still a thousand percent, which I love. I love being around that.\u000A\u000A You seem to have had positive experiences with collaborators who seem like they\u0027d be pretty challenging to work with. Oliver Stone, for example, seems like a complete lunatic.\u000A\u000A I\u0027ve never had a bad experience, with the exception of—and even this wasn\u0027t horrible—except for Jonah Hex, because you knew something was really fucking wrong.\u000A\u000A Something was amiss.\u000A\u000A Yeah, I felt like something was wrong and it wasn\u0027t okay with me. It wasn\u0027t okay how people were presenting themselves, necessarily, y\u0027know? \u0027Cause I really do think that could have been a really fun film. A fun rendition of that type of genre, or whatever hybrid genre that we were trying to create at the moment. I still think it could have been really great. But no, I haven\u0027t—other than that, I\u0027ve never had a really bad [experience.] I keep hearing about them. And I keep hearing about them with some of the people that I\u0027ve worked with. And I just don\u0027t see it, at all. Oliver\u0027s fantastic, one of the most sensitive and incredible people I know. And I\u0027m not just saying that. That\u0027s purely how I feel. Who else? Sean, Denzel, Russell. Whoever.\u000A\u000A Presumably you\u0027ve heard the same things about a lot of these guys that we\u0027ve all heard.\u000A\u000A You do hear things, and maybe that\u0027s part of it. Maybe I hear things, and I get to the set and I\u0027m like, ready. [laughs] And I realize there\u0027s nothing to be ready for and that I\u0027m all fucked up and I don\u0027t know what to do with myself. No, they\u0027ve all been very gracious, in my experience. Very.\u000A\u000A And you seem to like to go back to those situations. The next few things you\u0027ve got coming out are all re-teams with directors you\u0027ve worked with before.\u000A\u000A Yeah, I know. Which I hope to continue. You know, the Coens, I just have a ball with. And we\u0027re always talking about what we can do together. And then Oliver and I are always talking about things. I just love working with him. Strangely enough—to just stay on the subject that we\u0027re talking about—there\u0027s an extreme lack of pretense in my experience of these people. They just want to do the work. I was just with the Coens in San Francisco. I try to keep my mouth shut—I do my very best—and watch them edit, which I\u0027ve done on several of their movies, just to experience it, just to watch them do what they do. And it\u0027s a very simple, economic process with them. And that\u0027s why I love being around it. Cause it doesn\u0027t have to be chaotic, it doesn\u0027t have to be this thing. Two perpendicular desks and a bellman\u0027s bell. That\u0027s it.\u000A\u000A What\u0027s the bellman\u0027s bell for?\u000A\u000A For Ethan to let Joel know that he\u0027s just dragged a preferred take over to his [computer.]\u000A\u000A So it\u0027s nonverbal between them, too.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s absolutely nonverbal. And there\u0027s never any argument, you know. There\u0027s hardly debate. It\u0027s just, like, \u0022You think that one, really? Wasn\u0027t there another one?\u0022 \u0027Oh yeah, I think there might have been another one. Yeah I\u0027ll look for that one.\u0022 \u0022Okay. No, no that didn\u0027t work. You were right.\u0022 \u0022Okay, on to the next scene.\u0022\u000A\u000A I love that they use a bellman\u0027s bell. It\u0027s very Barton Fink.\u000A\u000A It is, right. But it\u0027s easy, y\u0027know? Not easy, but simplified. Economic. I think economic is the best word. Economic.\u000A\u000A Right. There\u0027s not a needless expenditure of energy.\u000A\u000A It sure doesn\u0027t seem like it. Not in my experience. Whereas Oliver\u0027s different. Oliver may have quite a few people involved [in the editing process], several different rooms, but when it comes down to it, it\u0027s the same thing with him. It\u0027s very pointed and focused, whether on the set or editing or whatever. And it\u0027s just what I respond to. It\u0027s a much more collaborative arena than a status thing.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s interesting, because you seem to have had these great experiences working with directors like the Coens, or Woody Allen, who aren\u0027t known for being real hands-on directors of actors. \u000A\u000A Which is so not the case. I mean, Woody, maybe, a little bit. Y\u0027know, Woody would let me do my thing. But Woody makes you focus, man. I don\u0027t know if he makes you focus more than normal, but he creates an ambiance [where] you really want to please him, and you don\u0027t know why. You know, maybe it\u0027s his age. I don\u0027t know what it is. The fact that he\u0027s done 41 films, or however many he\u0027s done.\u000A\u000A Maybe it\u0027s the fact that he\u0027s Woody fucking Allen.\u000A\u000A [Laughing] The fact that he\u0027s Woody fucking Allen. That\u0027s true. That could be it. I don\u0027t know why. We seem to get along very well, and he was confident in what I was bringing to the table. He\u0027d say, \u0022Really make it your own, don\u0027t worry about fucking up so much and really allow it to be your own.\u0022 And I don\u0027t think I made the mistake of trying to do Woody, to be Woody, you know what I mean? I don\u0027t think I could if I tried. I think most people can\u0027t, but I didn\u0027t even attempt it.\u000A\u000A People do try, though. It\u0027s really weird. They do a Woody impression.\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t understand that in the least. I don\u0027t. It\u0027s like, Woody\u0027s not in the movie, so therefore you\u0027re playing Woody? Why? Is it the cadence in which he writes? Is it that thing? That\u0027s part of it, I think. There\u0027s a very specific vernacular that\u0027s his. But I think if you can find a different rhythm within that vernacular, I think it pleases him, y\u0027know? It\u0027s another rendition of the song. It\u0027s like when you hear Chris Cornell doing \u0022Billie Jean,\u0022 and you\u0027re like, \u0022Jesus Christ.\u0022 That\u0027s unbelievable. And not to take anything away from what Michael Jackson did, but suddenly you\u0027re hearing the poetry in it and you\u0027re just like \u0022Wow, this is a completely different deal. I\u0027m feeling different things, and I\u0027m hearing the song in different ways.\u0022 Just a different impact. It\u0027s the same thing with Woody. I think he feels that way. He\u0027s happy to see somebody come in and kind of twist up the rhythm and the cadence, but still using his vernacular. But once in a while, Woody would come up and he\u0027d be like, \u0022Josh, you—that\u0027s [supposed to be] a contraction. You broke the contraction.\u0022 And I\u0027d go, \u0022Yeah, it says \u0027didn\u0027t,\u0027 but I said \u0027did not,\u0027 cause I was trying to emphasize that that did not happen.\u0027 He says, \u0022Yeah, I know. But it says didn\u0027t.\u0022 And I\u0027m like, \u0022C\u0027mon, man. You said make it my own.\u0022 He says, \u0022No, no, no, I understand—but it says didn\u0027t.\u0022 And I\u0027m like, \u0022Fuck, okay. Okay, I understand. You want to do the whole thing again because I didn\u0027t say didn\u0027t. Alright, man. Whatever.\u0022 But I think those guys enjoy the fact that I try not to take it all too seriously.\u000A\u000A And that you care enough to push back on them about something like that.\u000A\u000A But ultimately they know I\u0027ll say \u0022didn\u0027t,\u0022 you know what I mean? So there\u0027s some fun volleying, going back and forth, but I do believe in and respect the fact that the directors are the directors. It\u0027s their vision, especially if they\u0027ve written it. I can bring what I bring, and I\u0027ll try and mix it up as much as possible, and either they go for it or they don\u0027t, but ultimately you\u0027re seeing their vision through. Like, when Sean and I were doing Milk—the drunk scene, my scene at the party, that wasn\u0027t written as a drunk scene. It was just a pretty straight scene where I give him this bottle of alcohol and I say \u0022Here\u0027s your gift, sorry I was late.\u0022 And I\u0027m kind of pissed at him, that he didn\u0027t vote for the bill that I had up.\u000A\u000A Right, I remember—he\u0027s slighted you in some way.\u000A\u000A Exactly. So I was bored by the scene. It was a boring scene. And I didn\u0027t want to be in a boring scene. And I said, y\u0027know, \u0022What if he\u0027s so pissed at this guy, he\u0027s so resentful and he\u0027s so kind of repressed also, that maybe he just starts drinking his gift. Maybe he thinks that\u0027s the ultimate rebellion, the ultimate fuck you. And he just starts drinking his gift on the way over. And then now, because he is so repressed, the alcohol surfaces a bunch of shit that you wish it hadn\u0027t the next day. So what would that be? What would that look like? That might be kind of fun, pathetic. You know, let\u0027s explore that.\u0022 And then we did. We explored that, and really had a good time. So that\u0027s the other end of the spectrum, y\u0027know. Of Gus [Van Sant] saying, \u0022Fuck. This needs to work, so why don\u0027t we just go with it?\u0022 And then he used what he used, which I think was the tamer version of what we were doing. To his credit—but it turned out to be a pretty decent exchange. An uncomfortable exchange.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s a really uncomfortable moment. It is a genuinely uncomfortable moment.\u000A\u000A I think it was genuinely uncomfortable for Sean. I remember looking at his face during takes and wanting to laugh and trying not to.\u000A\u000A And I assume any time you can create a genuine moment, even if it\u0027s a genuine moment of uncomfortableness, you feel like you\u0027re doing something right.\u000A\u000A Yeah, genuine. Exactly. Exactly. That\u0027s exactly right. Not to mix it up just to mix it up, and not to create something that you find compelling, masturbatorily compelling just for its own sake. You want it to lend to the story in some way and you want it to be the better decision, the more compelling decision, within the story. You always have to look at the global part of it, the big picture, and say \u0022Does this fit into the story, or am I just being selfish?\u0022 Like, \u0022Oh, this would be great for me. This is a great moment for me.\u0022\u000A\u000A Right. You don\u0027t want to be just creating an Oscar moment yourself.\u000A\u000A Yeah, I try not to do that. Which you\u0027ll see, in the Woody film. [laughs] Don\u0027t fucking write that, Alex. Don\u0027t write that.\u000A\u000A You have no compelling moments in that one?\u000A\u000A Not one compelling moment. [laughs]\u000A\u000A So, True Grit. You\u0027re not in it that much, but your character is important to the story. You\u0027re the guy Bridges is going after. You\u0027re the bounty-hunted.\u000A\u000A Yeah, Bridges, having been hired by this young girl. They\u0027re tracking this character down. Tom Chaney. And then you eventually see him—he surfaces. He climbs out from under a rock, figuratively.\u000A\u000A Although it could be literally, since it\u0027s a Western.\u000A\u000A It could be. Well, when you see him, you\u0027ll know what I mean. It very well could be literally.\u000A\u000A So you\u0027re a scummy dude in this, then?\u000A\u000A There\u0027s no adjective that could do it justice. And it\u0027ll either be awful or it\u0027ll be good. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any gray area.\u000A\u000A So this one was not for your ego then?\u000A\u000A No. Not lending to the leading man status. Nope. Whatever No Country did for me, this will take away.\u000A\u000A You\u0027re trying to undo that.\u000A\u000A Yeah, happily. The Coens are like, \u0022We put your career in another place and now we\u0027re going to take it away.\u0022 And I\u0027m smiling too, which I don\u0027t really understand. I\u0027m like, \u0022Yeah, okay, take it away. That\u0027ll be fun.\u0022 No—it was really fun. It was really, really, really fun. And the only thing that I\u0027m sorry for is that we couldn\u0027t have done more. But it just didn\u0027t belong in there. We thought about it, but [the Coens] were true to the book and what was written. I think it\u0027s fun, you know. I\u0027ve seen enough of it now to realize really how not only extremely beautiful, but how interesting it is. I mean, really, really interesting. What they choose to hold on is fascinating to me. You know, the moments that they let play out, and the moments that they kind of quickly play through. It\u0027s a really interesting sensibility. I personally completely understand it, which is why I like to be around it. Because it\u0027s not that this is so off the beaten path—it\u0027s just their sensibility. They don\u0027t know any other sensibility. And they\u0027re so true to it at this point. You know, it\u0027s not about, \u0022What can we do to make sure people see this movie?\u0022 They want people to see their movie, but again, you know it\u0027s that thing we were talking about before—it\u0027s not a conscious decision on their part, at all. In the least.\u000A\u000A They\u0027re not thinking, \u0022Oh—here\u0027s an opportunity for us to do a quirky thing.\u0022\u000A\u000A Exactly, exactly. The only evidence of that is both of them laughing, which you don\u0027t see often. But when it happens, it\u0027s so infectious and so wonderful, that you don\u0027t even want to say anything, even if you hate it. It\u0027s just like, \u0022God that just made them laugh. That\u0027s wonderful. [laughs]. Just go with that.\u0022\u000A\u000A It\u0027s the only clue that they know they\u0027re doing something slightly perverse.\u000A\u000A [Laughing] I don\u0027t even know. It could be that. It could be a lot of things.\u000A\u000A But I know what you mean. Having Llewelyn get killed off-screen in No Country, that seems like an example of that sensibility at work. A very Coen Brothers decision.\u000A\u000A Yeah—but no, though. Because that was in the book, man. You would think that was their decision…\u000A\u000A Well, sure—but a lot of people, adapting that story, might have felt the need to give the audience the closure of seeing you actually die. \u000A\u000A Oh, most people would have. I would say 99.9 percent of even the great directors I know would have. But no, it was never an issue with them. The only issue with them was whether or not to do a closer shot of Llewelyn to make sure that you knew it was Llewelyn, because, as it was, it was kind of a medium shot of him lying on the ground dead, and yet the clothing looked very similar to the Mexican that was crawling around in the parking lot before you got to the room, before Tommy Lee got to the room. But I liked that a lot. I voiced that loudly. The fact that you\u0027re not sure. So as you go into the next scene, not only are you dealing with the fact that you were raped of the tête-à-tête [between the main characters]—that\u0027s a little strong, but you know what I\u0027m saying.\u000A\u000A I know what you mean, though. They didn\u0027t worry about people feeling cheated of that movie thing, that confrontation that they\u0027ve been anticipating throughout the rest of the film, and thinking—\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027ve been cheated of the movie thing that I always complain about, because it\u0027s so Hollywood. And now I\u0027m getting what I\u0027ve hoped for, and not be pandered to, and now I\u0027m pissed about that.\u0022 So it\u0027s a great lesson, man. It\u0027s the greatest lesson. There\u0027s no way to please everybody, obviously—but even pleasing a small amount of people, you might as well not even worry about it. You don\u0027t want to confuse anybody, but I don\u0027t think there was any confusion there. I think it was disbelief.\u000A\u000A And it works—there\u0027s a shock factor when you actually realize what happened that\u0027s arguably greater than it would have been if they\u0027d given you a big operatic death scene.\u000A\u000A Right. And the greatest thing, at least financially, from a Scott Rudin point of view or from a Paramount or Miramax point of view is that—like with Inception, I guess—is that people came back to see it again just to make sure they saw what they saw, that they experienced what they experienced. I remember I got pulled over by a cop once. And the cop looks at me and goes, \u0022Hey, are you the guy in that frickin\u0027 \u0027Old Country for No Men\u0027?\u0022 Everybody fucks up the title, for some reason. \u0022Was that you?\u000A\u000AI fucking hated that movie.\u0022 I was like, \u0022Wow—a cop just told me that. Why? A cop\u0027s angry at me right now. Not because of anything I did on the highway. He\u0027s mad that I did that movie and he got sucked into watching it.\u0022 I was like, \u0022Are you going to give me a ticket, based on that? That\u0027s amazing. Wow.\u0022 It was a great compliment, y\u0027know? It was like the greatest compliment ever. Because what it meant was, \u0022I got sucked into the story, man. And I felt raped, that you were stolen from us, the great protagonist that was going to win, that was going to beat evil incarnate. And then you just died. And you got killed by the banditos, even worse.\u0022 I love it.\u000A\u000A You don\u0027t even get killed by the villain.\u000A\u000A No. I don\u0027t get killed by the grim reaper himself.\u000A\u000A You just kind of get unceremoniously whacked on the side.\u000A\u000A Exactly. So, no—True Grit I think is really great. I really do. I think Jeff\u0027s amazing and I think Matt\u0027s fantastic and I think the girl they got, that they finally hired was really top-notch, really great. That\u0027s another thing about those movies—everybody\u0027s doing the work. Everybody\u0027s really doing it. You know, they\u0027re messing with each other most of the time, but when it comes down to the work, everybody\u0027s very studied and really gung-ho about making it the best thing that they can make it. So that\u0027s great.\u000A\u000A Did you get a chance to watch Bridges work?\u000A\u000A I watched him work a little bit, and it was nice, cause I had never seen him work. And I had seen him around and I know him a little bit, not well, but I know him well enough. We didn\u0027t have any scenes together. We did, but it wasn\u0027t direct. And I loved watching him work. He was playing this game—I\u0027ve forgotten what it\u0027s called, but you have the two pigs in your hand, and you roll the two pigs. Have you ever seen this game?\u000A\u000A It\u0027s like a pig dice game? I think so.\u000A\u000A Yeah, exactly. So he\u0027d play that off on the side. [Bridges voice] \u0022Hey, let\u0027s play the pig game!\u0022 Barry Pepper is different. Barry Pepper—I think Barry, even though I really liked him a lot, I think he was in character the whole time. I think. I\u0027m not positive [laughs]. But I think. I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m not going to comment on that. I had heard that maybe Barry wasn\u0027t wearing all the clothing he could because it was more authentic.\u000A\u000A But Jeff—Jeff has a pretty high register. Like, [high voice] \u0022Hey, man? How\u0027s it going, man? It\u0027s a great moment. I\u0027m just kind of hanging out, man, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here.\u0022 He almost sounds like Owen Wilson a little bit. And then he\u0027ll go into character, and he\u0027ll be like [nonverbal, guttural Bridges grunts.] And then, \u0022Cut\u0022—and he\u0027ll be like, [high voice again] \u0022Hey, y\u0027know, I take these pictures, and if you look one way for a second, I snap the picture and then I\u0027ll whip it around and it\u0027s a comedy-tragedy thing. I can put it in my book. It\u0027ll be fun.\u0022 You\u0027re like, \u0022Okay, Jeff.\u0022 He\u0027s like a 12-year-old. [laughs] But it was really, really great watching him work and I think he\u0027s so masterful in this, I really do. He really comes across as incredibly authentic. Incredibly authentic. And also very funny. Like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. A lot of great physical comedy.\u000A\u000A He doesn\u0027t do enough comedies.\u000A\u000A Yeah, and he\u0027s great at it.\u000A\u000A I\u0027ve interviewed him before. You get the sense that he\u0027s somehow figured out how to fully commit to a part without carrying it around like a heavy weight, even if the material\u0027s kind of heavy.\u000A\u000A Yeah. There\u0027s a Buddhist quality to him. A monk quality. There\u0027s a dark side in some of his roles, and you see it when you see him work, but otherwise it\u0027s like, \u0022Hey, man, it\u0027s great, I love being here with you, man.\u0022 And you\u0027re like, \u0022Well, I love being here with you too, Jeff. We should do the scene now.\u0022 \u0022Yeah, let\u0027s do it. Rawwr!\u0022 And then you go, \u0022Oh—there it is. He\u0027s just saving it up. Got it.\u0022 Maybe he does that just to kind of catch you off guard, on camera, I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know if there\u0027s a strategy to it. I doubt that there\u0027s a strategy.\u000A\u000A You\u0027re doing __Men in Black III sometime soon, right? What was the lure of that one, for you? Did you just like the idea of playing the younger version of Tommy Lee Jones\u0027 character?\u000A\u000A Mmm-hmm. I\u0027ve always loved Will [Smith]. I respect Will a lot. I respect his decisions. He just has an uncanny ability to understand what to do next in order to stay where he\u0027s at, and that\u0027s a whole art in itself. But you know they came to me with the Men in Black thing, and you\u0027re humbled by the fact that they\u0027re coming to you. It\u0027s amazing. But then you have to look at the story. You know, I don\u0027t want to just do it just to do it, y\u0027know? Ultimately, when you\u0027re working, whether you\u0027re doing Ethan\u0027s play or Men in Black, it\u0027s ultimately the same thing—when you\u0027re finally working, you want it to be good work. So if I don\u0027t feel like I can lend anything to it that\u0027s really interesting and that makes it a better story, then there\u0027s really no point in me doing. Maybe somebody else could. I just have that limitation at that moment. And, but that, so when they came to me with Men in Black, I was like, \u0022I\u0027m not really into that.\u0022 And then they told me the insides of it, and that I\u0027d be playing young Tommy, and I just loved the idea of that. It scared the shit out of me when they said it, which was a good sign. Like, God, I don\u0027t know if I can do that. I can do young Malkovich. I can do that. But I\u0027m not sure if I can do Tommy. [laughs]\u000A\u000A I would actually love to see you do The John Malkovich Story, actually.\u000A\u000A I would, too. But I would want it to be a TV movie, not a regular movie. I would only agree to do it as, like, an after-school special.\u000A\u000A Maybe you can get something set up at Lifetime.\u000A\u000A Exactly. Or Hallmark. [does an eerily good Malkovich voice.] \u0022Would you guys like some tea? Oh, okay.\u0022 Johnny! Yeah, I\u0027d be good. I\u0027d love to play him. He\u0027s a guy I\u0027m obsessed with, and he knows it. I just think he\u0027s—you can\u0027t do any better than that, as a human being and as an actor. I just think he\u0027s the shit.\u000A\u000A Did you talk him into doing Jonah Hex? Was that your doing?\u000A\u000A [Laughs] \u0022Did you talk him into doing Jonah Hex?\u0022 I love the way you just said that. You couldn\u0027t hide it at all.\u000A\u000A Sorry. But was that your fault? \u000A\u000A That was my fault. That was my fault.\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t mean to make fun of that movie, but you put it out there first.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s okay. Our friendship is still intact. But yes, I did. I did. It was very important to me that Johnny did that role. [laughs] Yep.\u000A\u000A I liked some things about that movie. I liked how you never walked out of a building without the building exploding behind you. Not once.\u000A\u000A I know. It was all fun. All fun and games. \u0022What do we do in this scene?\u0022 \u0022I don\u0027t know, why don\u0027t we just blow it up?\u0022 I think that was my doing, too—\u0022What if we just make it explode?\u0022 And they thought—they took me literally. I didn\u0027t mean it literally. I was trying to make a point. I mean, you know what? Honestly, I\u0027ll tell you this, as much as we bag on it—Warner Bros. knew. I told Warner Bros., \u0022Look, I\u0027m not going to run away from this thing. I\u0027m going to run toward it.\u0022 Because that\u0027s what I think an actor should always do. You decide to do a movie, and then you promote it. But I said, \u0022I can\u0027t promote this movie and lose any integrity. So I need everybody to be on the same page here.\u0022 And so we were.\u000A\u000A The fact of the matter is, [the movie] lost itself, which was really too bad, because I really think there was some fun stuff in it. And, y\u0027know for whatever reason, panic or whatever that is, we went back in there and tried to do some things that I didn\u0027t necessarily agree with. That\u0027s not what ultimately did the movie in, but y\u0027know…\u000A\u000A You have to have a respect for audiences, y\u0027know? Once you lose that, once you\u0027re not keeping it in mind that audiences are much more intelligent than you\u0027re giving them credit for, and you release a movie like that the way it was released, that\u0027s what you get. That\u0027s what you get. People were going, \u0022We\u0027re actually watching the fucking movie, man. Do you know that? We actually realize that it doesn\u0027t make any sense at all.\u0022\u000A\u000A Yeah. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s because I\u0027d heard all the stuff about the changes that were made to it relatively late in the process, but when I was watching it, it felt like it was a couple different movies fighting it out.\u000A\u000A I would have to agree with you. I would second that. You look at it—look, there\u0027s different types of writing. Like, I don\u0027t mean to keep bringing up Ethan and Joel, like they\u0027re the ultimate, because, y\u0027know, they are or they\u0027re not, whatever, but I\u0027ve talked to them at length about writing. There\u0027s a process in their writing, but it\u0027s not necessarily a Robert McKee process, y\u0027know? It\u0027s not Syd Field\u0027s process? I know that they write, and they get to the end of the scene, and they go, \u0022Okay—what could happen next? What could be great? What could be compelling? What could be dynamic?\u0022\u000A\u000A They\u0027re not thinking, like, \u0022Here\u0027s my inciting incident. Here\u0027s my pivotal plot point that\u0027s supposed to be resolved by page 50.\u0022 \u000A\u000A Exactly. Exactly. That\u0027s just intuitive for them at this point. And they\u0027re guys who are obviously writing [other stuff] beyond what you see. Ethan\u0027s writing short stories and plays, and Joel writes, and all that. So they\u0027re always looking for a great story to tell, and playing with whatever structures they play with. Haggis is another one, although Haggis is a guy who\u0027s much more structured. But what I was going to say was, y\u0027know, Toy Story 3.\u000A\u000A Okay.\u000A\u000A I love animated films anyway—I went to go see Toy Story 3 by myself, because I always try to see those films by myself so I can cry freely without anybody worrying about me, and that\u0027s the truth. But what a fucking movie, man! What a movie! I mean, structurally it\u0027s perfect. It\u0027s the perfect film, you know. They don\u0027t want to be left behind, they\u0027re trying to figure out how to reattach the connection, and because of that, things get fucked up, they get thrown out of the house, and then it\u0027s them trying to find their way back to the house. And every obstacle may be something that may help them further get back to the house or get closer to the house, or be an obstacle putting them further away from the house. It\u0027s that simple. And it\u0027s brilliant.\u000A\u000A Right. It\u0027s like David Mamet-level simplicity, where the purpose of every scene is just to drive the story into the next scene. He\u0027s always talking about that.\u000A\u000A But I don\u0027t know if he\u0027s able to do it. But yeah, you\u0027re right. He\u0027s good at talking about it. He\u0027s great at talking about it. You know, it\u0027s the same thing with Sidney Lumet\u0027s book on directing. He talks about it really brilliantly. But he\u0027s also a guy who can actually really do it. But yeah. So I have a lot of respect for that, you know. O Brother, Where Art Thou was a lot of that. They escape from prison, and then how do you get to the place when you\u0027re not running anymore? And then obstacles, y\u0027know? Like the guy singing \u0022O Death.\u0022 What was he doing there, and why? It didn\u0027t really matter. He was just another obstacle, y\u0027know? You\u0027re like, \u0022How\u0027s this one going to go? Is it going to help, or is it going to hurt?\u0022 And that\u0027s why that movie flows, I think, as well as it does.\u000A\u000A Well, it\u0027s basically The Odyssey. It\u0027s the oldest story in the world.\u000A\u000A Exactly.\u000A\u000A Or wait—it\u0027s The Iliad.\u000A\u000A Yeah. It\u0027s actually The Iliad, but I know what you meant. I wasn\u0027t going to correct you.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s okay. We\u0027ve been bagging on Jonah Hex for an hour.\u000A\u000A I know we have, right. You deserve it. [laughs]\u000A\u000A I appreciate how honest you\u0027re being about that movie. It\u0027s interesting when somebody\u0027s forthcoming about why they think something didn\u0027t work.\u000A\u000A It is. It is. And I don\u0027t want to put people down. I think you can tell, but I\u0027m not saying, \u0022Well, it was Warner Bros. and the way they marketed it. It was this and that.\u0022 I don\u0027t believe that. I think that they had good intentions, too. I think everybody—well, I think almost everybody had good intentions. I think a few people were extremely selfish, but, y\u0027know. I got a lot of people to do that movie, man, and that\u0027s the only anger I have about it. I don\u0027t have any about the movie itself. I mean, I think it\u0027s too bad it turned out the way it did, or it was received the way it was. But I got a lot of people to do that movie. Not only actors; I asked a lot of favors from really incredible crew members who I adore, and you know, I had them out in 110 degree heat, and 96 percent humidity for three months. Thanks a lot. [laughs]\u000A\u000A That\u0027s on you.\u000A\u000A \u0022I appreciate it! See you on the next one. Maybe not.\u0022\u000A\u000A Well, that\u0027s the thing. The only way to make this right is for you to go back in and do Jonah Hex: Reloaded.\u000A\u000A You know, it\u0027s funny, because we were joking about that the other day. I go, \u0022I just wanted to keep doing that movie over and over and over. Just do different renditions of that movie and wait and see which one hits. There\u0027s gotta be one in there. There\u0027s gotta be one successful version. I\u0027m willing to lose $200 million to do this movie eight more times.\u0022 [laughs]\u000A\u000A It\u0027ll just be a work in progress, forever. Like Blade Runner.\u000A\u000A I honestly think [Jonah Hex] would have been a better movie had we only had $15 million.\u000A\u000A I agree.\u000A\u000A You know what I\u0027m saying?\u000A\u000A Yeah. If you\u0027d just made it a spaghetti Western that happened to be based on a comic book.\u000A\u000A That was the intention. When I went into Warner Bros., I came in with a disc, and it was High Plains Drifter. And I said, \u0027This should be the base of the movie. Anytime anybody gets squirrelly, we should always go back to this. Even though we\u0027re making something different, my feeling is it should always go back to this, no matter what. It has to be a foundation to springboard from, always.\u0022 And I think it started out as that, but then…\u000A\u000A You should go back. There should be no shame. Nic Cage is doing another Ghost Rider.\u000A\u000A Thanks. You\u0027re just digging my grave now. \u0022Hey, Nic\u0027s doing another Ghost Rider—you should do Jonah Hex again!\u0022 Oh, thanks, Alex. Okay. Buh-bye.\u000A\u000A We talked for the first time a couple of years ago, when you had No Country and all those other films kind of hitting all at once, when there was this perception that you\u0027d finally hit your stride as an actor, or you were making a comeback, or however you want to classify it. Now that it\u0027s been a few years, does the work feel different? You\u0027re trying to maintain something, as opposed to trying to prove something. \u000A\u000A Sort of. I don\u0027t see it as maintaining, necessarily. The only thing I want to maintain is the thing we were talking about from the beginning—that I continue doing things. It doesn\u0027t matter if it\u0027s a small part, a big part, a lead, a supporting role, a cameo. It doesn\u0027t, really. It\u0027s something that I\u0027ve talked about with my agent, who I adore and who I think is wonderful, and I always stress that because nobody stresses that. I really think he\u0027s incredible. I love his sensibilities, and he and I—really, I couldn\u0027t do what I\u0027m doing without him. So you know we\u0027ve made it a very conscious choice to not get into that thing of, y\u0027know, \u0022Let\u0027s get to this place where we just do big movies and only do that so we can make as much money as possible, you know, before this moment\u0027s over,\u0022 that kind of thing. We said it doesn\u0027t have to be that. We can have very typical fluctuations and hopefully work through them. The difference is that we\u0027re taking absolute and total advantage of a moment to create an arena where we can instigate our own projects. And not in the way that we go, \u0022Oh, I want to do another romantic comedy so I can get paid 8 million bucks and produce it, but not really produce it.\u0022 I mean, we\u0027re really trying to get in there and do stories that are risky and that are classic stories, and then within that, keep trying to mix it up for me as an actor. And a couple of the things we\u0027re developing really do scare me. They really scare me because I\u0027m like, \u0022Can I actually do that? I\u0027m not sure if I\u0027m good enough to be able to do that\u0022—which is why I want to try it, you know. If things end, they\u0027re going to end horrendously. That\u0027s what I\u0027m saying. [laughs] I want to make sure that it\u0027s a massive train wreck.\u000A\u000A Right. Where it\u0027s not just that you\u0027ll never work in this town again—if it ends, you want it to end with you actually, like, in jail.\u000A\u000A Exactly. I want to be jailed for doing such a horrendous job. That\u0027s kind of how I feel. I want to keep banging away and keep doing stuff that people respond to. And it\u0027s interesting, that people respond to this stuff. Whether it\u0027s Milk or American Gangster or whatever—at first glance, they don\u0027t seem to be accessible parts, per se.\u000A\u000A Yeah, they\u0027re not likable guys, a lot of the time.\u000A\u000A No, yeah. At least not in this run. I think that\u0027s part of the attraction of Men in Black—I\u0027m doing that, and I think there\u0027s another project I\u0027m probably going to do over the summer that also has a little more levity to it. But there\u0027s levity in the range we\u0027re playing in. So it can be a bad guy, but there can be levity, and there can be more complexity within that role. And that\u0027s kind of what I\u0027m looking for now, if I can say I\u0027m looking for anything, which is probably not true. It\u0027s like, okay—I think I\u0027ve done the tortured guy, or the guy who\u0027s so full of himself and gets really confused and ends up killing himself. Nah, I don\u0027t want to do that anymore.\u000A\u000A You\u0027ve died in enough movies.\u000A\u000A Which is cute for a couple years, y\u0027know? And then you go, okay—what are you doing?\u000A\u000A I\u0027ve kept you long enough. This has been great.\u000A\u000A You know what would be funny, because it\u0027s such a long interview? You could have the interview go over like 14 pages, and you can have all the other actors\u0027 pictures on each page, but only have my interview.\u000A\u000A You could actually comment on everybody else. The whole thing could be \u0022Text: Josh Brolin.\u0022\u000A\u000A Yeah! Just little one-liners about how Josh feels about all these other actors.\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m not familiar with his work.\u0022\u000A\u000A Right. Under Bobby Duvall\u0027s picture, there\u0027s just a quote from Josh that just says, \u0022I feel that he phones it in.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Mediocre talent.\u0022\u000A\u000A On Harry Dean: \u0022If it wasn\u0027t for his face, he wouldn\u0027t be working.\u0027 Shit like that.\u0022",

character actor earlier this decade after snapping a midcareer cold streak, Brolin has worked with the Coen brothers, Woody Allen, and Oliver Stone. He was also the star of <em>Jonah Hex</em>, but we won&apos;t hold that against him.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2"> <strong>You postponed this interview so you could spend the morning surfing, because you&apos;d heard the surf was good today. How was it?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3"> The ocean was cold, refreshing, but with no surf.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>Oh, so you were lied to. You were deceived.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.6"> I was deceived [<em>laughs</em>]. I was sorely deceived. I went out with a couple buddies, and we were told it was going to be great. But you know what? Honestly, it sounds so lame, but just to get out in the ocean is almost enough, sometimes.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>A bad day surfing is better than a good day doing many other things.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.8"> Exactly, right. I&apos;ve been trying to do more and more, just to equalize a bit, because I get so into manic work mode that I forget to do all those things that you&apos;re supposed to do to utilize this money that you&apos;re making.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.9"> <strong>Your leisure time that you bought, with your hard work and sweat.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.a"> Exactly. Actors are always saying, y&apos;know, &quot;I tried to read the script. I just got so much that I&apos;m doing right now, man.&quot; In reality, actors probably do less than anybody else on the planet. [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.b"> <strong>People weren&apos;t happy that we used a shot of you smoking a cigarette on the cover. We got letters.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.c"> I heard, I heard. And you know, what&apos;s funny is, there was a conscious choice during that shoot that we weren&apos;t going to smoke during the shoot. So that was a pre-photograph. That was a test photograph, as we were waiting to do a real photograph, and that&apos;s the photograph they used. But it&apos;s all good.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.d"> <strong>It made for a good cover.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.e"> Good cover&#x2014;and understandably, people were upset. But I wonder if it does lead to anybody smoking in the end. I hope not.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.f"> <strong>What made you pick start smoking again?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.g"> You know, it&apos;s the lamest excuse ever, and hopefully it won&apos;t last for long, but I went to Cannes. I had two movies at Cannes. And I got there, and it was just one of those things&#x2014;nerves, whatever it was, a mask, a veil&#x2014;and I thought, &quot;Well, y&apos;know, I&apos;ll have a couple cigarettes and that&apos;ll be it. I&apos;m going on a trip&quot;&#x2014;my wife and I went on a trip after that&#x2014;&quot;and then I&apos;ll make sure not to smoke on that trip.&quot; And then, forget it. I mean, once I had two cigarettes, that was it. I bought a truckload and made sure to carry it in the trunk.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.h"> <strong>Back up the forklift.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.i"> Yeah, pretty much. And I hate it, I really do. I don&apos;t like it at all.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.j"> <strong>You had a window where you saw what it was like to not smoke. You were a different man, for a while.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.k"> It wasn&apos;t the first thought. That was the biggest thing. You start to realize&#x2014;it&apos;s something you&apos;re not conscious of when you&apos;re smoking, but when you stop smoking, you realize that it&apos;s not the first thought. I was smoking in Indonesia. We went on this surf trip, me and this buddy of mine that I was just with this morning, we went on a surf trip to Indonesia. Not only was I kind of rotund from having done Woody Allen&apos;s movie, but I was winded, also, because of the smoking. So you know, I was the KFC guy [<em>laughs</em>]. Hi guys! Everybody looks hot and they&apos;re just like all cut up and in shape and getting ready to surf, and then there&apos;s me, you know, looking more like a buoy.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.l"> <strong>You looked like shark bait.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.m"> Exactly. &quot;Nail the dude that smells like KFC.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.n"> <strong>So this package is really just an excuse for us to talk to a bunch of actors we actually kind of like, as opposed to people who have things to promote, necessarily.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.o"> The key word is &quot;kind of.&quot; A bunch of actors that we kind of like. Or we think we like, but we&apos;re never quite sure. I like that. I don&apos;t want to be involved in the portfolio that has to do with the actors that we love. I like the actors that we kind of like. That makes me feel much more comfortable in this interview.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.p"> <strong>You&apos;re in here with some heavy dudes. Duvall&apos;s in here.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.q"> I know! Duvall, whom I know well. And my grand favorite&#x2014;I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s more than Duvall, cause I really love him, but: Harry Dean. Harry Dean, whose pictures I saw when I showed up for the photo shoot, who looks fantastic, who brought his Spanish guitar and his little hat, his little cowboy hat. And he was singing them tunes. I&apos;ve never heard him sing. My wife has. I&apos;ve only heard him sing on the soundtrack for <em>Paris, Texas</em>, which is an amazing song, a Spanish song, that he sings on that soundtrack. It&apos;s incredible. But I know he&apos;s a virtuoso for sure, when it comes to Spanish-speaking songs.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.r"> <strong>Do you know him through Sean Penn, or&#x2014;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.s"> I know him slightly through Sean. I know that there was a moment when I was about 19 and Sean was like 25, 26, that I actually was desperate to just make my mark as an actor, or in any way, really. And I saw he and Harry Dean, out at Barney&apos;s Beanery, of course. Back then&#x2014;this was like the &apos;80s, I think. Some point in the &apos;80s. I think I was doing that series <em>Private Eye</em>, so I had a pompadour at the time. And it was around the time that <em>The Color of Money</em> came out. I was playing pool, and it looked like I was trying to do my own rendition of what success might like, which was Tom Cruise in <em>Color of Money</em>. It was like I had a sign on my back that just said &quot;Beat me up, now.&quot; And I think Sean threw out a few comments based on that. That was before I knew him. But yeah, that&apos;s really my only run-in with him. With the exception of&#x2014;there was one time, at a restaurant. I sat at the table with him, and I don&apos;t know if he remembers it or not, Harry Dean, but&#x2014;yeah, well, he consumed. Just say that, consumed. But I don&apos;t really have any close ties with him. I wish I did. The closest ties I have with him are once-removed, and that&apos;s through the movie that I love so much, <em>Paris, Texas</em>. I&apos;ve probably seen that movie 20 times, if not more. I just love it. Love it.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.t"> <strong>Great soundtrack, too.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.u"> Amazing soundtrack by Ry Cooder. I asked Bob Dylan to do <em>The People Speak</em>, and luckily he had seen <em>No Country</em> or something and was really smitten with that movie, so we were able to communicate, kind of, via that. So we went down to Malibu, where Bob was cool with doing it, and we had some cameras and some recording equipment and all that. And Bob came down there, and then in walks this other guy. And I&apos;m like, &quot;Fuck, why does that guy look so familiar?&quot; Bob had just decided he&apos;d bring Ry Cooder along, you know, to back him up during &quot;Do Re Mi&quot; and one other song. I think he did two songs, maybe three. My mind was completely blown, having no idea, really, how to deal with this duo. Cause it&apos;s just amazing. Just the history involved, and the juggling that they&apos;ve done. &quot;Okay, now we&apos;ve done this. Now what should we do?&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know, let&apos;s take all our talents and kind of throw them in the air and see where it lands.&quot; And then that turns out to be brilliant, and they&apos;re like, &quot;Okay, let&apos;s do it again and bring somebody else in and see what happens.&quot; It was just an amazing experience to be able to watch them do their thing.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.v"> <strong>What was their rapport like? Did they communicate verbally?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.w"> It was very unverbal. Nonverbal communication. Just a real laconic understanding. More of a tilt of the head, or an index-finger communication. They were rehearsing, and they just got into this groove. After a few of those finger communications, or, y&apos;know, glances at each other, they just got into a groove that was mind-blowing to me. I mean, it really was. It was like other-worldly, you know. And I know, with Bob, from what I&apos;ve heard, it&apos;s like he&apos;s always great. But then it just went into this other place. And you understand why he&apos;s Bob Dylan, and still around, playing as well as he is, and respected as much as he is. We were just sitting there with our jaws down to the floor, going, &quot;How are they&#x2014;what is that extra thing?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.x"> <strong>There&apos;s some kind of fourth dimension that people like that get into.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.y"> There really is. It was really something. I&apos;d never really experienced it. I experienced it with Eddie Vedder. That was another time. Where he was playing &quot;Masters of War&quot; and he almost became rabid while he was singing it. There was something that happened there during that song, that, again, he reached this place that separates them from the norm. From the typical, the common geniuses.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.z"> <strong>Right. Your run-of-the-mill geniuses. Did you get to talk to Dylan at all? Does he make small talk?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.10"> There was a little small talk. There was a little movie small talk, there was a little music small talk. I don&apos;t really&#x2026;yeah. We&apos;ve spoken. And it&apos;s, you know, there was nothing other than just kind of brotherly sweetness about it, you know. But I do remember that after that whole thing happened, we didn&apos;t speak a lot. It&apos;s not like we got to know each other really well. But we had enough communication to say that we know each other somewhat.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.11"> And there&apos;s a buddy of mine who was involved in <em>The People Speak</em>, [director] Anthony Arnove. I was in New York. I don&apos;t know what I was doing, I was doing something, working. And he said, &quot;Do you want to come up and see Dylan with me?&quot; I think it was in Washington Heights. Up at this amazing theater. Amazing. It used to be a church and they converted it. But anyway, I said, yeah, I would love to. So he had these seats that were kind of, you know, halfway back on the left side of the aisle. And we went, and I guess somebody had told Bob that we were there, they ran up to us in our seats halfway through the gig and said, &quot;Bob would love to see you backstage. Maybe two songs before he ends, you can go backstage.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.12">And so, my buddy Anthony, who&apos;s seen him probably 60 times, said, &quot;Listen&quot;&#x2014;he felt like he had some inside information, from just seeing him so many times, and studying like he has&#x2014;&quot;what Bob does after a show is, he runs out. He runs to his bus and he doesn&apos;t really stop and say hello. He doesn&apos;t have a full conversation. But what he likes to do is, he doesn&apos;t like to shake hands or anything, so just put your fist out there. He likes to fist bump.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.13">I was like, &quot;really?&quot; He said, &quot;Yeah. It&apos;s just a fist bump. And it&apos;s kind of common knowledge now, for anybody who&apos;s been backstage.&quot; And I was like, &quot;Oh.&quot; So we go backstage, and he finishes the last two songs, and he steps off for a second and we didn&apos;t say anything to him. And then he went back on stage and did an encore. An amazing encore. And then, finally, he left and you could tell that was it. And then Bob was coming our way, headed outside. You know, it was kind of dark. So I had my fist up there high, where he could see it. I don&apos;t know if Anthony did, but I wanted to be respectful. I guess if you&apos;re into fist bumping, that&apos;s the thing to do. So Bob comes and he sees me and I go, &quot;Hey, man.&quot; And I had my fist up there, like, &quot;I&apos;m ready.&quot; And he gave me this huge hug. This huge hug. He was like, &quot;Josh, oh my God, I&apos;m so glad you made it. How are you? Thank you so much for allowing me to be a part of <em>The People Speak</em>. You know, I saw it and it really came out well. And I&apos;m just so proud to be a part of it, and thanks man.&quot; I didn&apos;t know what was happening. And I said, &quot;You remember my friend Anthony?&quot; And he&apos;s like, &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; And Anthony&apos;s sitting there with his fist up in the air, waiting to be bumped. But that never happened.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.14"> <strong>Do you find yourself looking to guys like that for lessons? About longevity, how to sustain your creativity in a long-haul career, stuff like that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.15"> Y&apos;know, it&apos;s like what I said, about throwing things up in the air and then seeing how they land and saying &quot;Let&apos;s try that.&quot; I think there&apos;s a little more strategy to it than that, but they keep mixing it up. And there&apos;s integrity behind what they do. They seem to stick&#x2014;all of &apos;em&#x2014;seem to stick with something very personal. Eddie&apos;s the same way. Dealing with these people&#x2014;they all seem to have a real respect for their own personal sensibilities. Not an arrogance, just a respect. They just know, like, &quot;If I do that other thing, I&apos;ll probably start feeling really shitty and I&apos;m kind of tired of that.&quot; And it&apos;s important to be respectful of the fans. I mean, look at what Eddie did with Ticketmaster, y&apos;know. That was a moment where I said, &quot;God, I have so much fucking respect for that band.&quot; It wasn&apos;t them going head-to-head with a big corporation just to say, &quot;Hey, look, we&apos;re real artists, we&apos;re going to go up against a big corporation just to make a point.&quot; It was a very specific thing, always, with the fans in mind. I really think that was the intention. Like, when we were kids and we wanted to go see our favorite band, there was no reason we couldn&apos;t pay $28 to go see them. It wasn&apos;t like, &quot;Okay, I&apos;ll work for a month so I can go out one night and see this band that I love.&quot; I have a lot of respect for that.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.16">I remember when they were actually playing off-the-beaten-track places, like state fairgrounds and stuff like that, just to get around the whole Ticketmaster monolith. I don&apos;t know if they really changed anything, but they at least demonstrated that it was possible to cut those guys out of the process. Exactly, exactly. And why not? &quot;Oh, we can&apos;t do that now because we&apos;re too big and it will make it seem like we&apos;re losing our edge, or that we&apos;re not as popular as we used to be, so therefore we can&apos;t play lesser venues or smaller venues.&quot; That doesn&apos;t seem to be the case with them. They seem to continue to do what they want. So, what I think you may be asking, ultimately, is how does that affect me? Yes. I try and do the same thing, with that lesson in mind. It doesn&apos;t just come out of my own intelligence, for sure.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.17"> <strong>Trying to mix it up, you mean?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.18"> Trying to mix it up, and then also realizing that a good part is just a good part. And if I&apos;m going to do True Grit, it may not be a huge part, but it&apos;s an integral part for great filmmakers who I love, who I love as people, first and foremost, and that I love as artists, absolutely. And you know, I did that thing <em>Jonah Hex</em> recently, which I think we all had the best intentions for. I think that movie could have been a really, really fun and great movie. But y&apos;know, that&apos;s what happens when you go outside of that trajectory and you go &quot;Okay, let&apos;s mix it up, and let&apos;s give a new [director] a break and see what happens. Somebody who seems to have a lot of energy and a lot of creativity.&quot; It was just a bad call on my part.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.19"> <strong>Since you brought it up&#x2014;what do you think went wrong there, with <em>Jonah Hex</em>? What was the biggest problem?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> The biggest problem initially?</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> <strong>Sure.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> I think there was a guy who presented himself as one thing and turned out to be something else. I think that was the biggest problem, and I think I can say that with total confidence. There&apos;s people who you might not think are professional, you know, or who you think might be a problem on the set. And then they get on the set&#x2014;I&apos;m just talking generally now&#x2014;you get on the set, and you&apos;re like, &quot;Wow, this person really cares about what they&apos;re doing.&quot; However they come off publicly is one thing, but then you see them on the set&#x2014;I&apos;m talking about people I&apos;ve worked with, really wonderful actors&#x2014;and you go, &quot;God, man, they&apos;re not only respectful of other people, but they&apos;re respectful of the process and they&apos;re workhorses. They go out there and when they decide to do a job, they really lend themselves to it absolutely and entirely, you know.&quot; And even if you&apos;re having fun within what you&apos;re doing, it&apos;s the conviction level is still a thousand percent, which I love. I love being around that.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> <strong>You seem to have had positive experiences with collaborators who seem like they&apos;d be pretty challenging to work with. Oliver Stone, for example, seems like a complete lunatic.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> I&apos;ve never had a bad experience, with the exception of&#x2014;and even this wasn&apos;t horrible&#x2014;except for <em>Jonah Hex</em>, because you knew something was really fucking wrong.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> <strong>Something was amiss.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> Yeah, I felt like something was wrong and it wasn&apos;t okay with me. It wasn&apos;t okay how people were presenting themselves, necessarily, y&apos;know? &apos;Cause I really do think that could have been a really fun film. A fun rendition of that type of genre, or whatever hybrid genre that we were trying to create at the moment. I still think it could have been really great. But no, I haven&apos;t&#x2014;other than that, I&apos;ve never had a really bad [experience.] I keep hearing about them. And I keep hearing about them with some of the people that I&apos;ve worked with. And I just don&apos;t see it, at all. Oliver&apos;s fantastic, one of the most sensitive and incredible people I know. And I&apos;m not just saying that. That&apos;s purely how I feel. Who else? Sean, Denzel, Russell. Whoever.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1h"> <strong>Presumably you&apos;ve heard the same things about a lot of these guys that we&apos;ve all heard.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1i"> You do hear things, and maybe that&apos;s part of it. Maybe I hear things, and I get to the set and I&apos;m like, ready. [<em>laughs</em>] And I realize there&apos;s nothing to be ready for and that I&apos;m all fucked up and I don&apos;t know what to do with myself. No, they&apos;ve all been very gracious, in my experience. Very.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1j"> <strong>And you seem to like to go back to those situations. The next few things you&apos;ve got coming out are all re-teams with directors you&apos;ve worked with before.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1k"> Yeah, I know. Which I hope to continue. You know, the Coens, I just have a ball with. And we&apos;re always talking about what we can do together. And then Oliver and I are always talking about things. I just love working with him. Strangely enough&#x2014;to just stay on the subject that we&apos;re talking about&#x2014;there&apos;s an extreme lack of pretense in my experience of these people. They just want to do the work. I was just with the Coens in San Francisco. I try to keep my mouth shut&#x2014;I do my very best&#x2014;and watch them edit, which I&apos;ve done on several of their movies, just to experience it, just to watch them do what they do. And it&apos;s a very simple, economic process with them. And that&apos;s why I love being around it. Cause it doesn&apos;t have to be chaotic, it doesn&apos;t have to be this thing. Two perpendicular desks and a bellman&apos;s bell. That&apos;s it.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1l"> <strong>What&apos;s the bellman&apos;s bell for?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1m"> For Ethan to let Joel know that he&apos;s just dragged a preferred take over to his [computer.]</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1n"> <strong>So it&apos;s nonverbal between them, too.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1o"> It&apos;s absolutely nonverbal. And there&apos;s never any argument, you know. There&apos;s hardly debate. It&apos;s just, like, &quot;You think that one, really? Wasn&apos;t there another one?&quot; &apos;Oh yeah, I think there might have been another one. Yeah I&apos;ll look for that one.&quot; &quot;Okay. No, no that didn&apos;t work. You were right.&quot; &quot;Okay, on to the next scene.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1p"> <strong>I love that they use a bellman&apos;s bell. It&apos;s very Barton Fink.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1q"> It is, right. But it&apos;s easy, y&apos;know? Not easy, but simplified. Economic. I think economic is the best word. Economic.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1r"> <strong>Right. There&apos;s not a needless expenditure of energy.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1s"> It sure doesn&apos;t seem like it. Not in my experience. Whereas Oliver&apos;s different. Oliver may have quite a few people involved [in the editing process], several different rooms, but when it comes down to it, it&apos;s the same thing with him. It&apos;s very pointed and focused, whether on the set or editing or whatever. And it&apos;s just what I respond to. It&apos;s a much more collaborative arena than a status thing.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1t"> <strong>It&apos;s interesting, because you seem to have had these great experiences working with directors like the Coens, or Woody Allen, who aren&apos;t known for being real hands-on directors of actors. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1u"> Which is so not the case. I mean, Woody, maybe, a little bit. Y&apos;know, Woody would let me do my thing. But Woody makes you focus, man. I don&apos;t know if he makes you focus more than normal, but he creates an ambiance [where] you really want to please him, and you don&apos;t know why. You know, maybe it&apos;s his age. I don&apos;t know what it is. The fact that he&apos;s done 41 films, or however many he&apos;s done.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1v"> <strong>Maybe it&apos;s the fact that he&apos;s Woody fucking Allen.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1w"> [Laughing] The fact that he&apos;s Woody fucking Allen. That&apos;s true. That could be it. I don&apos;t know why. We seem to get along very well, and he was confident in what I was bringing to the table. He&apos;d say, &quot;Really make it your own, don&apos;t worry about fucking up so much and really allow it to be your own.&quot; And I don&apos;t think I made the mistake of trying to do Woody, to be Woody, you know what I mean? I don&apos;t think I could if I tried. I think most people can&apos;t, but I didn&apos;t even attempt it.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1x"> <strong>People do try, though. It&apos;s really weird. They do a Woody impression.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1y"> I don&apos;t understand that in the least. I don&apos;t. It&apos;s like, Woody&apos;s not in the movie, so therefore you&apos;re playing Woody? Why? Is it the cadence in which he writes? Is it that thing? That&apos;s part of it, I think. There&apos;s a very specific vernacular that&apos;s his. But I think if you can find a different rhythm within that vernacular, I think it pleases him, y&apos;know? It&apos;s another rendition of the song. It&apos;s like when you hear Chris Cornell doing &quot;Billie Jean,&quot; and you&apos;re like, &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot; That&apos;s unbelievable. And not to take anything away from what Michael Jackson did, but suddenly you&apos;re hearing the poetry in it and you&apos;re just like &quot;Wow, this is a completely different deal. I&apos;m feeling different things, and I&apos;m hearing the song in different ways.&quot; Just a different impact. It&apos;s the same thing with Woody. I think he feels that way. He&apos;s happy to see somebody come in and kind of twist up the rhythm and the cadence, but still using his vernacular. But once in a while, Woody would come up and he&apos;d be like, &quot;Josh, you&#x2014;that&apos;s [supposed to be] a contraction. You broke the contraction.&quot; And I&apos;d go, &quot;Yeah, it says &apos;didn&apos;t,&apos; but I said &apos;did not,&apos; cause I was trying to emphasize that that did not happen.&apos; He says, &quot;Yeah, I know. But it says didn&apos;t.&quot; And I&apos;m like, &quot;C&apos;mon, man. You said make it my own.&quot; He says, &quot;No, no, no, I understand&#x2014;but it says didn&apos;t.&quot; And I&apos;m like, &quot;Fuck, okay. Okay, I understand. You want to do the whole thing again because I didn&apos;t say didn&apos;t. Alright, man. Whatever.&quot; But I think those guys enjoy the fact that I try not to take it all too seriously.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.1z"> <strong>And that you care enough to push back on them about something like that.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.20"> But ultimately they know I&apos;ll say &quot;didn&apos;t,&quot; you know what I mean? So there&apos;s some fun volleying, going back and forth, but I do believe in and respect the fact that the directors are the directors. It&apos;s their vision, especially if they&apos;ve written it. I can bring what I bring, and I&apos;ll try and mix it up as much as possible, and either they go for it or they don&apos;t, but ultimately you&apos;re seeing their vision through. Like, when Sean and I were doing <em>Milk</em>&#x2014;the drunk scene, my scene at the party, that wasn&apos;t written as a drunk scene. It was just a pretty straight scene where I give him this bottle of alcohol and I say &quot;Here&apos;s your gift, sorry I was late.&quot; And I&apos;m kind of pissed at him, that he didn&apos;t vote for the bill that I had up.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.21"> <strong>Right, I remember&#x2014;he&apos;s slighted you in some way.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.22"> Exactly. So I was bored by the scene. It was a boring scene. And I didn&apos;t want to be in a boring scene. And I said, y&apos;know, &quot;What if he&apos;s so pissed at this guy, he&apos;s so resentful and he&apos;s so kind of repressed also, that maybe he just starts drinking his gift. Maybe he thinks that&apos;s the ultimate rebellion, the ultimate fuck you. And he just starts drinking his gift on the way over. And then now, because he is so repressed, the alcohol surfaces a bunch of shit that you wish it hadn&apos;t the next day. So what would that be? What would that look like? That might be kind of fun, pathetic. You know, let&apos;s explore that.&quot; And then we did. We explored that, and really had a good time. So that&apos;s the other end of the spectrum, y&apos;know. Of Gus [Van Sant] saying, &quot;Fuck. This needs to work, so why don&apos;t we just go with it?&quot; And then he used what he used, which I think was the tamer version of what we were doing. To his credit&#x2014;but it turned out to be a pretty decent exchange. An uncomfortable exchange.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.23"> <strong>It&apos;s a really uncomfortable moment. It is a genuinely uncomfortable moment.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.24"> I think it was genuinely uncomfortable for Sean. I remember looking at his face during takes and wanting to laugh and trying not to.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.25"> <strong>And I assume any time you can create a genuine moment, even if it&apos;s a genuine moment of uncomfortableness, you feel like you&apos;re doing something right.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.26"> Yeah, genuine. Exactly. Exactly. That&apos;s exactly right. Not to mix it up just to mix it up, and not to create something that you find compelling, masturbatorily compelling just for its own sake. You want it to lend to the story in some way and you want it to be the better decision, the more compelling decision, within the story. You always have to look at the global part of it, the big picture, and say &quot;Does this fit into the story, or am I just being selfish?&quot; Like, &quot;Oh, this would be great for me. This is a great moment for me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.27"> <strong>Right. You don&apos;t want to be just creating an Oscar moment yourself.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.28"> Yeah, I try not to do that. Which you&apos;ll see, in the Woody film. [<em>laughs</em>] Don&apos;t fucking write that, Alex. Don&apos;t write that.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.29"> <strong>You have no compelling moments in that one?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2a"> Not one compelling moment. [laughs]</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2b"> <strong>So, <em>True Grit</em>. You&apos;re not in it that much, but your character is important to the story. You&apos;re the guy Bridges is going after. You&apos;re the bounty-hunted.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2c"> Yeah, Bridges, having been hired by this young girl. They&apos;re tracking this character down. Tom Chaney. And then you eventually see him&#x2014;he surfaces. He climbs out from under a rock, figuratively.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2d"> <strong>Although it could be literally, since it&apos;s a Western.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2e"> It could be. Well, when you see him, you&apos;ll know what I mean. It very well could be literally.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2f"> <strong>So you&apos;re a scummy dude in this, then?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2g"> There&apos;s no adjective that could do it justice. And it&apos;ll either be awful or it&apos;ll be good. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s any gray area.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2h"> <strong>So this one was not for your ego then?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2i"> No. Not lending to the leading man status. Nope. Whatever <em>No Country</em> did for me, this will take away.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2j"> <strong>You&apos;re trying to undo that.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2k"> Yeah, happily. The Coens are like, &quot;We put your career in another place and now we&apos;re going to take it away.&quot; And I&apos;m smiling too, which I don&apos;t really understand. I&apos;m like, &quot;Yeah, okay, take it away. That&apos;ll be fun.&quot; No&#x2014;it was really fun. It was really, really, really fun. And the only thing that I&apos;m sorry for is that we couldn&apos;t have done more. But it just didn&apos;t belong in there. We thought about it, but [the Coens] were true to the book and what was written. I think it&apos;s fun, you know. I&apos;ve seen enough of it now to realize really how not only extremely beautiful, but how interesting it is. I mean, really, really interesting. What they choose to hold on is fascinating to me. You know, the moments that they let play out, and the moments that they kind of quickly play through. It&apos;s a really interesting sensibility. I personally completely understand it, which is why I like to be around it. Because it&apos;s not that this is so off the beaten path&#x2014;it&apos;s just their sensibility. They don&apos;t know any other sensibility. And they&apos;re so true to it at this point. You know, it&apos;s not about, &quot;What can we do to make sure people see this movie?&quot; They want people to see their movie, but again, you know it&apos;s that thing we were talking about before&#x2014;it&apos;s not a conscious decision on their part, at all. In the least.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2l"> <strong>They&apos;re not thinking, &quot;Oh&#x2014;here&apos;s an opportunity for us to do a quirky thing.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2m"> Exactly, exactly. The only evidence of that is both of them laughing, which you don&apos;t see often. But when it happens, it&apos;s so infectious and so wonderful, that you don&apos;t even want to say anything, even if you hate it. It&apos;s just like, &quot;God that just made them laugh. That&apos;s wonderful. [laughs]. Just go with that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2n"> <strong>It&apos;s the only clue that they know they&apos;re doing something slightly perverse.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2o"> [Laughing] I don&apos;t even know. It could be that. It could be a lot of things.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2p"> <strong>But I know what you mean. Having Llewelyn get killed off-screen in <em>No Country</em>, that seems like an example of that sensibility at work. A very Coen Brothers decision.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2q"> Yeah&#x2014;but no, though. Because that was in the book, man. You would think that was their decision&#x2026;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2r"> <strong>Well, sure&#x2014;but a lot of people, adapting that story, might have felt the need to give the audience the closure of seeing you actually die. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2s"> Oh, most people would have. I would say 99.9 percent of even the great directors I know would have. But no, it was never an issue with them. The only issue with them was whether or not to do a closer shot of Llewelyn to make sure that you knew it was Llewelyn, because, as it was, it was kind of a medium shot of him lying on the ground dead, and yet the clothing looked very similar to the Mexican that was crawling around in the parking lot before you got to the room, before Tommy Lee got to the room. But I liked that a lot. I voiced that loudly. The fact that you&apos;re not sure. So as you go into the next scene, not only are you dealing with the fact that you were raped of the t&#xEA;te-&#xE0;-t&#xEA;te [between the main characters]&#x2014;that&apos;s a little strong, but you know what I&apos;m saying.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2t"> <strong>I know what you mean, though. They didn&apos;t worry about people feeling cheated of that movie thing, that confrontation that they&apos;ve been anticipating throughout the rest of the film, and thinking&#x2014;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2u"> &quot;I&apos;ve been cheated of the movie thing that I always complain about, because it&apos;s so Hollywood. And now I&apos;m getting what I&apos;ve hoped for, and not be pandered to, and now I&apos;m pissed about that.&quot; So it&apos;s a great lesson, man. It&apos;s the greatest lesson. There&apos;s no way to please everybody, obviously&#x2014;but even pleasing a small amount of people, you might as well not even worry about it. You don&apos;t want to confuse anybody, but I don&apos;t think there was any confusion there. I think it was disbelief.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2v"> <strong>And it works&#x2014;there&apos;s a shock factor when you actually realize what happened that&apos;s arguably greater than it would have been if they&apos;d given you a big operatic death scene.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2w"> Right. And the greatest thing, at least financially, from a Scott Rudin point of view or from a Paramount or Miramax point of view is that&#x2014;like with <em>Inception</em>, I guess&#x2014;is that people came back to see it again just to make sure they saw what they saw, that they experienced what they experienced. I remember I got pulled over by a cop once. And the cop looks at me and goes, &quot;Hey, are you the guy in that frickin&apos; &apos;Old Country for No Men&apos;?&quot; Everybody fucks up the title, for some reason. &quot;Was that you?</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2x">I fucking hated that movie.&quot; I was like, &quot;Wow&#x2014;a cop just told me that. Why? A cop&apos;s angry at me right now. Not because of anything I did on the highway. He&apos;s mad that I did that movie and he got sucked into watching it.&quot; I was like, &quot;Are you going to give me a ticket, based on that? That&apos;s amazing. Wow.&quot; It was a great compliment, y&apos;know? It was like the greatest compliment ever. Because what it meant was, &quot;I got sucked into the story, man. And I felt raped, that you were stolen from us, the great protagonist that was going to win, that was going to beat evil incarnate. And then you just died. And you got killed by the banditos, even worse.&quot; I love it.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2y"> <strong>You don&apos;t even get killed by the villain.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.2z"> No. I don&apos;t get killed by the grim reaper himself.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.30"> <strong>You just kind of get unceremoniously whacked on the side.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.31"> Exactly. So, no&#x2014;True Grit I think is really great. I really do. I think Jeff&apos;s amazing and I think Matt&apos;s fantastic and I think the girl they got, that they finally hired was really top-notch, really great. That&apos;s another thing about those movies&#x2014;everybody&apos;s doing the work. Everybody&apos;s really doing it. You know, they&apos;re messing with each other most of the time, but when it comes down to the work, everybody&apos;s very studied and really gung-ho about making it the best thing that they can make it. So that&apos;s great.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.32"> <strong>Did you get a chance to watch Bridges work?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.33"> I watched him work a little bit, and it was nice, cause I had never seen him work. And I had seen him around and I know him a little bit, not well, but I know him well enough. We didn&apos;t have any scenes together. We did, but it wasn&apos;t direct. And I loved watching him work. He was playing this game&#x2014;I&apos;ve forgotten what it&apos;s called, but you have the two pigs in your hand, and you roll the two pigs. Have you ever seen this game?</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.34"> <strong>It&apos;s like a pig dice game? I think so.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.35"> Yeah, exactly. So he&apos;d play that off on the side. [<em>Bridges voice</em>] &quot;Hey, let&apos;s play the pig game!&quot; Barry Pepper is different. Barry Pepper&#x2014;I think Barry, even though I really liked him a lot, I think he was in character the whole time. I think. I&apos;m not positive [<em>laughs</em>]. But I think. I don&apos;t know. I&apos;m not going to comment on that. I had heard that maybe Barry wasn&apos;t wearing all the clothing he could because it was more authentic.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.36"> But Jeff&#x2014;Jeff has a pretty high register. Like, [<em>high voice</em>] &quot;Hey, man? How&apos;s it going, man? It&apos;s a great moment. I&apos;m just kind of hanging out, man, I&apos;m glad you&apos;re here.&quot; He almost sounds like Owen Wilson a little bit. And then he&apos;ll go into character, and he&apos;ll be like [nonverbal, guttural Bridges grunts.] And then, &quot;Cut&quot;&#x2014;and he&apos;ll be like, [high voice again] &quot;Hey, y&apos;know, I take these pictures, and if you look one way for a second, I snap the picture and then I&apos;ll whip it around and it&apos;s a comedy-tragedy thing. I can put it in my book. It&apos;ll be fun.&quot; You&apos;re like, &quot;Okay, Jeff.&quot; He&apos;s like a 12-year-old. [<em>laughs</em>] But it was really, really great watching him work and I think he&apos;s so masterful in this, I really do. He really comes across as incredibly authentic. Incredibly authentic. And also very funny. Like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. A lot of great physical comedy.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.37"> <strong>He doesn&apos;t do enough comedies.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.38"> Yeah, and he&apos;s great at it.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.39"> <strong>I&apos;ve interviewed him before. You get the sense that he&apos;s somehow figured out how to fully commit to a part without carrying it around like a heavy weight, even if the material&apos;s kind of heavy.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3a"> Yeah. There&apos;s a Buddhist quality to him. A monk quality. There&apos;s a dark side in some of his roles, and you see it when you see him work, but otherwise it&apos;s like, &quot;Hey, man, it&apos;s great, I love being here with you, man.&quot; And you&apos;re like, &quot;Well, I love being here with you too, Jeff. We should do the scene now.&quot; &quot;Yeah, let&apos;s do it. Rawwr!&quot; And then you go, &quot;Oh&#x2014;there it is. He&apos;s just saving it up. Got it.&quot; Maybe he does that just to kind of catch you off guard, on camera, I don&apos;t know. I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a strategy to it. I doubt that there&apos;s a strategy.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3b"> <strong>You&apos;re doing __Men in Black<em> III</em> sometime soon, right? What was the lure of that one, for you? Did you just like the idea of playing the younger version of Tommy Lee Jones&apos; character?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3c"> Mmm-hmm. I&apos;ve always loved Will [Smith]. I respect Will a lot. I respect his decisions. He just has an uncanny ability to understand what to do next in order to stay where he&apos;s at, and that&apos;s a whole art in itself. But you know they came to me with the <em>Men in Black</em> thing, and you&apos;re humbled by the fact that they&apos;re coming to you. It&apos;s amazing. But then you have to look at the story. You know, I don&apos;t want to just do it just to do it, y&apos;know? Ultimately, when you&apos;re working, whether you&apos;re doing Ethan&apos;s play or <em>Men in Black</em>, it&apos;s ultimately the same thing&#x2014;when you&apos;re finally working, you want it to be good work. So if I don&apos;t feel like I can lend anything to it that&apos;s really interesting and that makes it a better story, then there&apos;s really no point in me doing. Maybe somebody else could. I just have that limitation at that moment. And, but that, so when they came to me with <em>Men in Black</em>, I was like, &quot;I&apos;m not really into that.&quot; And then they told me the insides of it, and that I&apos;d be playing young Tommy, and I just loved the idea of that. It scared the shit out of me when they said it, which was a good sign. Like, God, I don&apos;t know if I can do that. I can do young Malkovich. I can do that. But I&apos;m not sure if I can do Tommy. [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3d"> <strong>I would actually love to see you do <em>The John Malkovich Story</em>, actually.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3e"> I would, too. But I would want it to be a TV movie, not a regular movie. I would only agree to do it as, like, an after-school special.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3f"> <strong>Maybe you can get something set up at Lifetime.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3g"> Exactly. Or Hallmark. [does an eerily good Malkovich voice.] &quot;Would you guys like some tea? Oh, okay.&quot; Johnny! Yeah, I&apos;d be good. I&apos;d love to play him. He&apos;s a guy I&apos;m obsessed with, and he knows it. I just think he&apos;s&#x2014;you can&apos;t do any better than that, as a human being and as an actor. I just think he&apos;s the shit.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3h"> <strong>Did you talk him into doing <em>Jonah Hex</em>? Was that your doing?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3i"> [<em>Laughs</em>] &quot;Did you talk him into doing <em>Jonah Hex</em>?&quot; I love the way you just said that. You couldn&apos;t hide it at all.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3j"> <strong>Sorry. But was that your fault? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3k"> That was my fault. That was my fault.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3l"> <strong>I don&apos;t mean to make fun of that movie, but you put it out there first.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3m"> It&apos;s okay. Our friendship is still intact. But yes, I did. I did. It was very important to me that Johnny did that role. [<em>laughs</em>] Yep.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3n"> <strong>I liked some things about that movie. I liked how you never walked out of a building without the building exploding behind you. Not once.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3o"> I know. It was all fun. All fun and games. &quot;What do we do in this scene?&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know, why don&apos;t we just blow it up?&quot; I think that was my doing, too&#x2014;&quot;What if we just make it explode?&quot; And they thought&#x2014;they took me literally. I didn&apos;t mean it literally. I was trying to make a point. I mean, you know what? Honestly, I&apos;ll tell you this, as much as we bag on it&#x2014;Warner Bros. knew. I told Warner Bros., &quot;Look, I&apos;m not going to run away from this thing. I&apos;m going to run toward it.&quot; Because that&apos;s what I think an actor should always do. You decide to do a movie, and then you promote it. But I said, &quot;I can&apos;t promote this movie and lose any integrity. So I need everybody to be on the same page here.&quot; And so we were.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3p"> The fact of the matter is, [the movie] lost itself, which was really too bad, because I really think there was some fun stuff in it. And, y&apos;know for whatever reason, panic or whatever that is, we went back in there and tried to do some things that I didn&apos;t necessarily agree with. That&apos;s not what ultimately did the movie in, but y&apos;know&#x2026;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3q"> You have to have a respect for audiences, y&apos;know? Once you lose that, once you&apos;re not keeping it in mind that audiences are much more intelligent than you&apos;re giving them credit for, and you release a movie like that the way it was released, that&apos;s what you get. That&apos;s what you get. People were going, &quot;We&apos;re actually watching the fucking movie, man. Do you know that? We actually realize that it doesn&apos;t make any sense at all.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3r"> <strong>Yeah. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because I&apos;d heard all the stuff about the changes that were made to it relatively late in the process, but when I was watching it, it felt like it was a couple different movies fighting it out.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3s"> I would have to agree with you. I would second that. You look at it&#x2014;look, there&apos;s different types of writing. Like, I don&apos;t mean to keep bringing up Ethan and Joel, like they&apos;re the ultimate, because, y&apos;know, they are or they&apos;re not, whatever, but I&apos;ve talked to them at length about writing. There&apos;s a process in their writing, but it&apos;s not necessarily a Robert McKee process, y&apos;know? It&apos;s not Syd Field&apos;s process? I know that they write, and they get to the end of the scene, and they go, &quot;Okay&#x2014;what could happen next? What could be great? What could be compelling? What could be dynamic?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3t"> <strong>They&apos;re not thinking, like, &quot;Here&apos;s my inciting incident. Here&apos;s my pivotal plot point that&apos;s supposed to be resolved by page 50.&quot; </strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3u"> Exactly. Exactly. That&apos;s just intuitive for them at this point. And they&apos;re guys who are obviously writing [other stuff] beyond what you see. Ethan&apos;s writing short stories and plays, and Joel writes, and all that. So they&apos;re always looking for a great story to tell, and playing with whatever structures they play with. Haggis is another one, although Haggis is a guy who&apos;s much more structured. But what I was going to say was, y&apos;know, <em>Toy Story 3</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3v"> <strong>Okay.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3w"> I love animated films anyway&#x2014;I went to go see <em>Toy Story 3</em> by myself, because I always try to see those films by myself so I can cry freely without anybody worrying about me, and that&apos;s the truth. But what a fucking movie, man! What a movie! I mean, structurally it&apos;s perfect. It&apos;s the perfect film, you know. They don&apos;t want to be left behind, they&apos;re trying to figure out how to reattach the connection, and because of that, things get fucked up, they get thrown out of the house, and then it&apos;s them trying to find their way back to the house. And every obstacle may be something that may help them further get back to the house or get closer to the house, or be an obstacle putting them further away from the house. It&apos;s that simple. And it&apos;s brilliant.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3x"> <strong>Right. It&apos;s like David Mamet-level simplicity, where the purpose of every scene is just to drive the story into the next scene. He&apos;s always talking about that.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3y"> But I don&apos;t know if he&apos;s able to do it. But yeah, you&apos;re right. He&apos;s good at talking about it. He&apos;s great at talking about it. You know, it&apos;s the same thing with Sidney Lumet&apos;s book on directing. He talks about it really brilliantly. But he&apos;s also a guy who can actually really do it. But yeah. So I have a lot of respect for that, you know. <em>O Brother, Where Art Thou</em> was a lot of that. They escape from prison, and then how do you get to the place when you&apos;re not running anymore? And then obstacles, y&apos;know? Like the guy singing &quot;O Death.&quot; What was he doing there, and why? It didn&apos;t really matter. He was just another obstacle, y&apos;know? You&apos;re like, &quot;How&apos;s this one going to go? Is it going to help, or is it going to hurt?&quot; And that&apos;s why that movie flows, I think, as well as it does.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.3z"> <strong>Well, it&apos;s basically <em>The Odyssey</em>. It&apos;s the oldest story in the world.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.40"> Exactly.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.41"> <strong>Or wait&#x2014;it&apos;s <em>The Iliad</em>.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.42"> Yeah. It&apos;s actually <em>The Iliad</em>, but I know what you meant. I wasn&apos;t going to correct you.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.43"> <strong>It&apos;s okay. We&apos;ve been bagging on <em>Jonah Hex</em> for an hour.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.44"> I know we have, right. You deserve it. [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.45"> <strong>I appreciate how honest you&apos;re being about that movie. It&apos;s interesting when somebody&apos;s forthcoming about why they think something didn&apos;t work.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.46"> It is. It is. And I don&apos;t want to put people down. I think you can tell, but I&apos;m not saying, &quot;Well, it was Warner Bros. and the way they marketed it. It was this and that.&quot; I don&apos;t believe that. I think that they had good intentions, too. I think everybody&#x2014;well, I think almost everybody had good intentions. I think a few people were extremely selfish, but, y&apos;know. I got a lot of people to do that movie, man, and that&apos;s the only anger I have about it. I don&apos;t have any about the movie itself. I mean, I think it&apos;s too bad it turned out the way it did, or it was received the way it was. But I got a lot of people to do that movie. Not only actors; I asked a lot of favors from really incredible crew members who I adore, and you know, I had them out in 110 degree heat, and 96 percent humidity for three months. Thanks a lot. [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.47"> <strong>That&apos;s on you.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.48"> &quot;I appreciate it! See you on the next one. Maybe not.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.49"> <strong>Well, that&apos;s the thing. The only way to make this right is for you to go back in and do <em>Jonah Hex: Reloaded</em>.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4a"> You know, it&apos;s funny, because we were joking about that the other day. I go, &quot;I just wanted to keep doing that movie over and over and over. Just do different renditions of that movie and wait and see which one hits. There&apos;s gotta be one in there. There&apos;s gotta be one successful version. I&apos;m willing to lose $200 million to do this movie eight more times.&quot; [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4b"> <strong>It&apos;ll just be a work in progress, forever. Like <em>Blade Runner</em>.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4c"> I honestly think [<em>Jonah Hex</em>] would have been a better movie had we only had $15 million.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4d"> <strong>I agree.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4e"> You know what I&apos;m saying?</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4f"> <strong>Yeah. If you&apos;d just made it a spaghetti Western that happened to be based on a comic book.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4g"> That was the intention. When I went into Warner Bros., I came in with a disc, and it was <em>High Plains Drifter</em>. And I said, &apos;This should be the base of the movie. Anytime anybody gets squirrelly, we should always go back to this. Even though we&apos;re making something different, my feeling is it should always go back to this, no matter what. It has to be a foundation to springboard from, always.&quot; And I think it started out as that, but then&#x2026;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4h"> <strong>You should go back. There should be no shame. Nic Cage is doing another <em>Ghost Rider</em>.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4i"> Thanks. You&apos;re just digging my grave now. &quot;Hey, Nic&apos;s doing another <em>Ghost Rider</em>&#x2014;you should do <em>Jonah Hex</em> again!&quot; Oh, thanks, Alex. Okay. Buh-bye.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4j"> <strong>We talked for the first time a couple of years ago, when you had <em>No Country</em> and all those other films kind of hitting all at once, when there was this perception that you&apos;d finally hit your stride as an actor, or you were making a comeback, or however you want to classify it. Now that it&apos;s been a few years, does the work feel different? You&apos;re trying to maintain something, as opposed to trying to prove something. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4k"> Sort of. I don&apos;t see it as maintaining, necessarily. The only thing I want to maintain is the thing we were talking about from the beginning&#x2014;that I continue doing things. It doesn&apos;t matter if it&apos;s a small part, a big part, a lead, a supporting role, a cameo. It doesn&apos;t, really. It&apos;s something that I&apos;ve talked about with my agent, who I adore and who I think is wonderful, and I always stress that because nobody stresses that. I really think he&apos;s incredible. I love his sensibilities, and he and I&#x2014;really, I couldn&apos;t do what I&apos;m doing without him. So you know we&apos;ve made it a very conscious choice to not get into that thing of, y&apos;know, &quot;Let&apos;s get to this place where we just do big movies and only do that so we can make as much money as possible, you know, before this moment&apos;s over,&quot; that kind of thing. We said it doesn&apos;t have to be that. We can have very typical fluctuations and hopefully work through them. The difference is that we&apos;re taking absolute and total advantage of a moment to create an arena where we can instigate our own projects. And not in the way that we go, &quot;Oh, I want to do another romantic comedy so I can get paid 8 million bucks and produce it, but not really produce it.&quot; I mean, we&apos;re really trying to get in there and do stories that are risky and that are classic stories, and then within that, keep trying to mix it up for me as an actor. And a couple of the things we&apos;re developing really do scare me. They really scare me because I&apos;m like, &quot;Can I actually do that? I&apos;m not sure if I&apos;m good enough to be able to do that&quot;&#x2014;which is why I want to try it, you know. If things end, they&apos;re going to end horrendously. That&apos;s what I&apos;m saying. [<em>laughs</em>] I want to make sure that it&apos;s a massive train wreck.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4l"> <strong>Right. Where it&apos;s not just that you&apos;ll never work in this town again&#x2014;if it ends, you want it to end with you actually, like, in jail.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4m"> Exactly. I want to be jailed for doing such a horrendous job. That&apos;s kind of how I feel. I want to keep banging away and keep doing stuff that people respond to. And it&apos;s interesting, that people respond to this stuff. Whether it&apos;s <em>Milk</em> or <em>American Gangster</em> or whatever&#x2014;at first glance, they don&apos;t seem to be accessible parts, per se.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4n"> <strong>Yeah, they&apos;re not likable guys, a lot of the time.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4o"> No, yeah. At least not in this run. I think that&apos;s part of the attraction of <strong>Men in Black</strong>&#x2014;I&apos;m doing that, and I think there&apos;s another project I&apos;m probably going to do over the summer that also has a little more levity to it. But there&apos;s levity in the range we&apos;re playing in. So it can be a bad guy, but there can be levity, and there can be more complexity within that role. And that&apos;s kind of what I&apos;m looking for now, if I can say I&apos;m looking for anything, which is probably not true. It&apos;s like, okay&#x2014;I think I&apos;ve done the tortured guy, or the guy who&apos;s so full of himself and gets really confused and ends up killing himself. Nah, I don&apos;t want to do that anymore.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4p"> <strong>You&apos;ve died in enough movies.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4q"> Which is cute for a couple years, y&apos;know? And then you go, okay&#x2014;what are you doing?</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4r"> <strong>I&apos;ve kept you long enough. This has been great.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4s"> You know what would be funny, because it&apos;s such a long interview? You could have the interview go over like 14 pages, and you can have all the other actors&apos; pictures on each page, but only have my interview.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4t"> <strong>You could actually comment on everybody else. The whole thing could be &quot;Text: Josh Brolin.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4u"> Yeah! Just little one-liners about how Josh feels about all these other actors.</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4v"> <strong>&quot;I&apos;m not familiar with his work.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4w"> Right. Under Bobby Duvall&apos;s picture, there&apos;s just a quote from Josh that just says, &quot;I feel that he phones it in.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12eflzu3pxc.1.1.0.0.4.4x"> <strong>&quot;Mediocre
