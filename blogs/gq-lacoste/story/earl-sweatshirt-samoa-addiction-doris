  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AEarl Sweatshirt is back, but he\u0027s not quite here. Not yet. Somewhere close to the very top of the Empire, he is only just now beginning to stir. The rest of us loiter below, making small talk, speculating about his arrival.\u000A\u000AThe countdown has begun. It\u0027s early August, two weeks before Earl (born Thebe Neruda Kgositsile), the youngest member of the L.A.-based hip-hop collective, Odd Future, will release Doris, his frothily anticipated major label debut. It\u0027s one day before he\u0027ll appear on \u0022Late Night\u0022 with Jimmy Fallon – the venue in which his Grammy-raking fellow Odd Future alum, Frank Ocean, had his first breakout performance in 2012. And it\u0027s closing in on one hour after I was instructed to meet him here, in the lobby of Manhattan\u0027s plush Empire Hotel, for a rare audience. He is, I\u0027m told again and again by his managers, just rolling out of bed somewhere many floors above us. He had a long night. He will be here any second. They\u0027re sure of it.\u000A\u000AOne can perhaps be forgiven for doubting that Earl will ever materialize. It was, after all, less than three years ago that he was yanked by his mother from Odd Future\u0027s rowdy ranks and shipped off to the Coral Reef Academy, a therapeutic reform school in Samoa. In his absence – and thanks in large part to Earl, his lurid and precocious debut mixtape, which was released just months before he left – Odd Future developed a rabid following. A \u0022Free Earl\u0022 campaign, initially launched by frontman Tyler, the Creator, was hijacked by the group\u0027s mostly young and social media-savvy followers. It quickly corkscrewed into zealotry, including threats on his mother\u0027s safety. By the time Earl did return, in February of 2012, the group was playing sold-out shows at venues across the country. People he had never met would scream his name and tweet his picture and approach him on the street.\u000A\u000AEarl\u0027s arrival here is a decidedly quieter affair. He shakes my hand, slides into a chair and folds himself over his knees. The effect is that of a mousetrap snapping shut in slow motion. At 19, he is shorter than he looks in videos, and just as thin. He has the wide-set features of his father, the South African poet Keorapetse Kgositsile, and a series of impossibly elegant chicken pox scars that slice a diagonal path between his eyebrows. He\u0027s not feeling loquacious – quite the opposite in fact – but he perks up a bit when a teenage girl approaches and asks to have her picture taken with him.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, sure. Of course,\u0022 he mumbles, eyes adroop.\u000A\u000AWe head to the hotel\u0027s roof, where bartenders blast pop music to an empty patio and gray clouds collect menacingly overhead. Below, New Yorkers scuttle from building to building, umbrellas tucked under their arms. The city, it seems, is bracing for a storm.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AGQ: When I turned 19, I spent my birthday watching \u0022Bruce Almighty\u0022 with my parents. Or maybe I went bowling? Please tell me yours was cooler.\u000A\u000A Earl: Nope. I played video games with my friends and ate tacos.\u000A\u000AStill better. What\u0027s the biggest difference between Earl Sweatshirt in 2009 and Earl Sweatshirt now?\u000A\u000A I\u0027m fucking grown now. I was a little-ass kid in 2009. I\u0027ve figured shit out – well not figured shit out. That\u0027s ridiculous. Not in some pretentious way, just as a result of time.\u000A\u000ASame question, but this time for Thebe.\u000A\u000A Same shit. I don\u0027t draw a line between them.\u000A\u000ALet\u0027s talk about Doris. There\u0027s a lot of pretty overt talk of mental illness on the album. At one point in the track \u0022Sunday,\u0022 you and Frank Ocean rap in unison, \u0022What good is West Coast weather if you\u0027re bipolar?\u0022 At another point, in \u0022Burgundy,\u0022 there\u0027s a voice-over that asks, \u0022Why you so depressed and sad all the time like a little bitch?\u0022 How did your own experience with mental illness inform this album?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t know about mental illness, but I\u0027m a sad bitch sometimes. That\u0027s the shit I\u0027m more attracted to, so even if I\u0027m not, the shit that gets me excited is all very moody and unstable. That\u0027s some shit that I don\u0027t even see changing. Like, I can\u0027t make that good of music when I\u0027m happy. Some shit has to happen that either pisses me off or that\u0027s very grave.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a really personal record – very different, content-wise, from Earl.\u000A\u000A Yeah. I didn\u0027t know how to say anything [back in 2010]. I didn\u0027t know how to keep a thought focused when I was young, and it kind of sounds like that. Like, it\u0027s tight or whatever, but it\u0027s just all over the place. I\u0027m still figuring that shit out. I feel like that\u0027s probably my next thing – focusing more. Because I can do it when I\u0027m writing. That\u0027s probably better for the music anyway, when it\u0027s more impulsive.\u000A\u000ADoris is still impulsive, but it\u0027s far less abrasive than Earl. I tried to count how many times there\u0027s a reference to raping or killing someone on Earl, and I just gave up.\u000A\u000A I\u0027m an adult. I can\u0027t be fucking talking about raping people and shit. That shit\u0027s crazy. As an adult, if you want to talk about rape, there\u0027s certain shit that comes along with it. \u000A\u000AAs part of your program in Samoa, you worked with victims of sexual assault, yes?\u000A\u000A Yeah, so you get to see that side of the fence, and then it\u0027s just fucked. That\u0027s what I\u0027m saying. That fully draws the line, where it\u0027s like you can stand on either side. Either you\u0027re a fool that is down with fucked up shit – I mean, I\u0027m a fan of macabre shit, you know what I\u0027m saying? But not like that. At the end of the day, I\u0027m not some evil guy.\u000A\u000AWas there a crucial moment you realized that?\u000A\u000A It was instant. There was nothing you could do when you\u0027re looking at a fucking little girl that\u0027s been horribly abused. It doesn\u0027t even need to be gradual. And there was never a moment where I was trying to fucking perpetrate like I was some [rapist]. I still have so much fun performing Earl. That shit was what it was. That was our way of like, screaming. That was my way of screaming, because I don\u0027t yell.\u000A\u000AAny subject, whether it\u0027s raping people or swag or some fucking shoes or something – if you rap about it enough, it\u0027s going to get boring. It was sick.\u000A\u000ADo you worry that not dealing with the same things that Earl dealt with will make you less appealing to people who loved all that rape and murder?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t care. Hey, one thing I\u0027ve learned in this past year is that motherfuckers are really stupid. There\u0027s a lot of really retarded people. That\u0027s not being a dick or anything; that\u0027s some real life shit. Like, I\u0027ve actually been amazed.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re pretty upfront about dealing with addiction issues on Doris. Was it something you were struggling with before you left for Samoa?\u000A\u000A Yeah, it was before I left. Now I can go through these awesome little two-week things where – well, not anymore because I don\u0027t have time to – but when I didn\u0027t have to do shit, I could go through two-week things where I could just get fucked up and then explore that, and then be done with that when I got over it. Then make some sick music.\u000A\u000ANothing extreme, though. It\u0027s 2013 and everyone smokes weed, and I don\u0027t want to be that one guy that\u0027s like \u0022Dude, I smoke weed.\u0022 But I was very high for a really long time, just to see what that was like. When I recorded the bulk of the album, I got so skinny because I was smoking weed and drinking Red Bull and smoking cigarettes. And I\u0027d eat Chick-fil-A like once every 12 hours.\u000A\u000AThis is after you\u0027re back?\u000A\u000A Yeah.\u000A\u000AOK. But if addiction is one of the things you were hoping to address by going away, and then you get back and do this sort of thing, is your relationship to this stuff at all different?\u000A\u000A Hell yeah! I just know what the fuck I\u0027m doing now. That\u0027s why I\u0027m not mad that I went away. A lot of niggas don\u0027t figure out the shit that I had to figure out until they\u0027re like 30 years old. I don\u0027t get attached to [drugs] anymore. I know the signs. Going away basically put tools in my toolbox. So I know how to use the shit – so if there\u0027s any red flags or anything, it\u0027s just like \u0022alright.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat does a red flag look like?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t know. If I\u0027m doing some shit too much. I did some stupid shit when I was recording. And I\u0027ll probably do some stupid shit when I record the next album, too. I\u0027m going to go to like London or something. Fucking Trainspotting.\u000A\u000AOne thing that\u0027s stayed similar on the two albums is this dynamic you and Tyler have on songs where you\u0027re both featured. He\u0027s got a sort of big-brother complex – half protective, half intimidating. Are you competitive in any other ways? Skateboarding?\u000A\u000A No. I\u0027m way better at skating than Tyler. He skates better transition than I do, but I skate way better. Because he\u0027s too goofy.\u000A\u000AArm wrestling?\u000A\u000A He\u0027ll fuck me up at arm wrestling. That fool\u0027s a fucking freak athlete. I hate him. He\u0027s fucking good at everything. I don\u0027t like it.\u000A\u000AWho got a better SAT score?\u000A\u000A Ha! I got a fucking better SAT score. This is the thing: I know I\u0027m more eloquent than Tyler is. Like as far as school and shit goes, I\u0027m technically better than him. But that\u0027s a smart nigga. That\u0027s a very smart man right there. He\u0027s also a fucking idiot.\u000A\u000AOne thing that\u0027s really compelling about your return is that you\u0027ve sort of bypassed all of the shitty parts about being a rapper. \u000A\u000A I bypassed a lot. I also missed the sick part of it too, though. Like, I didn\u0027t get to fully live in the world where we were still mysterious, like when we were cracking – when we were blowing up more, but not on a level where little girls would fuck with us. It was still kind of scary. I missed that. It was charged with dark energy.\u000A\u000AAfter you went away, you made it pretty clear that you weren\u0027t forced away – that the decision was the right one for you. \u000A\u000A I mean, I had to get forced away. But yeah, like I said, end result: I wasn\u0027t mad.\u000A\u000AWas there a moment before leaving where things got so bad that you realized you needed to go?\u000A\u000A I didn\u0027t even give a fuck. I was so heated when I went. And I was heated right after I went. And for like a year. I don\u0027t know if there was a moment when I realized shit was best for me, but my mom was just like – I was just fighting her back and forth all night on why the \u0022Free Earl\u0022 shit wasn\u0027t fucked up or whatever. Every week, you\u0027d meet with the therapist and talk to your parents. She was telling me she was afraid to go to work and she was having trouble getting dressed in the morning – to like get up and go to work and shit. She just didn\u0027t know what to do. I guess it\u0027s just one of those things where the line is drawn. You get to stand on either side of it. That was a fucked-up feeling.\u000A\u000AYou mentioned tools in your toolbox before. What were some of the other things you found most useful during your time away?\u000A\u000A I learned how to be patient. Some of the worst kids ever were there. Ever. No words could describe what it was like living twenty-four-seven with someone who, on the outside, you would vocalize your hate for. You have to live with him; you have no other option, you know what I mean? Like, your option is you either put up with some shit that you don\u0027t want to put up with, or stay till you\u0027re fucking twenty-one years old.\u000A\u000AWho determined that you were ready to go? How did that work?\u000A\u000A The therapist. There\u0027s like a level system that you have to work through. So you come in at a level one, and you leave at a level six. It\u0027s basically left up to you how long it takes to get through the shit. You don\u0027t have anything at level one. You don\u0027t have shit. You can\u0027t go to the bathroom by yourself. Then you slowly work your way through the level system and you get more privileges, more independence.\u000A\u000AWere you quick to work through those levels?\u000A\u000A Hell no! I was terrible. I was awful. For that whole year that I was talking about, I was the worst. I became the one example that people give. Like, when I came in, they always give new kids the examples like, \u0022Now if you want to leave here, you act like him. You don\u0027t want to be like him.\u0022 After a year, I was the \u0022you don\u0027t want to be like him.\u0022 I actually couldn\u0027t believe it. I turned into that one guy. I hated everything. If I thought I didn\u0027t like shit when I was at home, I really learned how to be a real piece of shit that hated myself and literally everything.\u000A\u000AAfter that year happened, I convinced myself that home wasn\u0027t real, that it was a figment of my imagination – that I was going to die there. Because as far as I was concerned, I was like, \u0022What the fuck can you show me of home?\u0022 When I closed my eyes and opened them, all I see is the palm trees.\u000A\u000AAnd yet here you are. \u000A\u000A I was like, \u0022I want to go home.\u0022 And it\u0027s entirely up to you. That\u0027s what I realized. For that whole year, I was like, \u0022You motherfuckers gonna keep me here?\u0022\u000A\u000ADo you ever worry that the more individual success Odd Future members get, the harder it will be to stay cohesive as a unit?\u000A\u000A We\u0027ll see with time, but yeah. That\u0027s a fucking weird thing to think about. Wild. I don\u0027t worry too much, because everyone was friends before we did music. So with or without music, everyone\u0027s still going to be straight. Odd Future\u0027s like a network, as opposed to like a rap group. I mean, obviously it\u0027s a rap group. But still, there\u0027s a lot of other shit going on than a bunch of fools that rap together.\u000A\u000AHow do you keep things close? Group meditations? Sweat lodges?\u000A\u000A We\u0027ve got the [Odd Future] store, and we\u0027re trying to make this vacation shit we do a yearly thing. We went to Hawaii last year. Everyone went to Hawaii. So tight. It was so tight. I was shrooming for like three days [he makes the sort of wide-eyed, happy zombie face one makes when pantomiming a psilocybin-laced beach vacation]. But I\u0027ve got a girlfriend now. I can\u0027t do that shit around my girlfriend. Oh, man.\u000A\u000AWhere\u0027d you meet?\u000A\u000A They [Tyler and other Odd Future members] were out here, and they were in a restaurant somewhere, and this girl and my girlfriend walked by. I wasn\u0027t even out here. Tyler got the one girl\u0027s number, and it turned out they lived in California. So then he hit her up while they were out there. They came to hang out with Tyler one time. I met that girl, and I thought she was hell-of annoying at first, and then somehow that shit worked out. I don\u0027t know. She got my number. I don\u0027t know how. She got my number and texted me.\u000A\u000AI\u0027m not an asshole anymore, either. She\u0027s making me fucking soft. It\u0027s like we\u0027re married, dude. I smoke weed like a fucking scared dad [He takes a few hasty puffs of an imaginary joint, his eyes darting back and forth]. I\u0027m like, \u0022Keep that outside!\u0022 And she\u0027s not even pressing me. I\u0027m just paranoid.\u000A\u000ABut you\u0027re happy.\u000A\u000A Yeah. See, when I start recording new shit then I\u0027ve got to like stall her out for a second. Because she makes me too happy. Shit won\u0027t work out.\u000A\u000AOn the final verse of the last song on Doris, you rap \u0022Young, black, and jaded/hazy vision strolling through the night.\u0022 Was that meant to be a sort of synopsis?\u000A\u000A That\u0027s a pretty perfect summation of where I\u0027m at most of the time. Like, kind of aloof and salty. And also young and black.\u000A\u000ALast question. There\u0027s a poem about you, written in 1995 by your family friend Sterling Plumpp, called \u0022Poet: for Thebe Neruda.\u0022 It ends this way: \u000A\u000A**\u0022You\u000A\u000A were born with blues.\u000A\u000A With an ANC [African National Congress] imprint\u000A\u000A on them. How you gon\u000A\u000A do anything but rule?\u0022**\u000A\u000ADo you feel fated to do what you do?\u000A\u000A I still have a hard time recognizing that you\u0027re good at something and not being a fucking dickhead. A lot of times, a lot of really talented people are dickheads. So I still have to get comfortable. My friends have to remind me that it\u0027s OK to own the fact that you\u0027re good at something. I think it\u0027ll just come with getting older. But I don\u0027t ever want to be a fucking asshole. So until I feel like I\u0027m able to find that balance – of not being a prick and fully owning the fact that I maybe am very good at something – I\u0027m very tired by it. Because a lot of times, it\u0027s a very, very thin line.",

Not yet. Somewhere close to the very top of the Empire, he is only just now beginning to stir. The rest of us loiter below, making small talk, speculating about his arrival.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.2">The countdown has begun. It&apos;s early August, two weeks before Earl (born Thebe Neruda Kgositsile), the youngest member of the L.A.-based hip-hop collective, Odd Future, will release <em>Doris</em>, his frothily anticipated major label debut. It&apos;s one day before he&apos;ll appear on &quot;Late Night&quot; with Jimmy Fallon &#x2013; the venue in which his Grammy-raking fellow Odd Future alum, Frank Ocean, had his first breakout performance in 2012. And it&apos;s closing in on one hour <em>after </em>I was instructed to meet him here, in the lobby of Manhattan&apos;s plush Empire Hotel, for a rare audience. He is, I&apos;m told again and again by his managers, just rolling out of bed somewhere many floors above us. He had a long night. He will be here any second. They&apos;re sure of it.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.3">One can perhaps be forgiven for doubting that Earl will ever materialize. It was, after all, less than three years ago that he was yanked by his mother from Odd Future&apos;s rowdy ranks and shipped off to the Coral Reef Academy, a therapeutic reform school in Samoa. In his absence &#x2013; and thanks in large part to <em>Earl</em>, his lurid and precocious debut mixtape, which was released just months before he left &#x2013; Odd Future developed a rabid following. A &quot;Free Earl&quot; campaign, initially launched by frontman Tyler, the Creator, was hijacked by the group&apos;s mostly young and social media-savvy followers. It quickly corkscrewed into zealotry, including threats on his mother&apos;s safety. By the time Earl did return, in February of 2012, the group was playing sold-out shows at venues across the country. People he had never met would scream his name and tweet his picture and approach him on the street.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.5">Earl&apos;s arrival here is a decidedly quieter affair. He shakes my hand, slides into a chair and folds himself over his knees. The effect is that of a mousetrap snapping shut in slow motion. At 19, he is shorter than he looks in videos, and just as thin. He has the wide-set features of his father, the South African poet Keorapetse Kgositsile, and a series of impossibly elegant chicken pox scars that slice a diagonal path between his eyebrows. He&apos;s not feeling loquacious &#x2013; quite the opposite in fact &#x2013; but he perks up a bit when a teenage girl approaches and asks to have her picture taken with him.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.6">&quot;Yeah, sure. Of course,&quot; he mumbles, eyes adroop.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.7">We head to the hotel&apos;s roof, where bartenders blast pop music to an empty patio and gray clouds collect menacingly overhead. Below, New Yorkers scuttle from building to building, umbrellas tucked under their arms. The city, it seems, is bracing for a storm.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.8">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>GQ: When I turned 19, I spent my birthday watching &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot; with my parents. Or maybe I went bowling? Please tell me yours was cooler.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong> Earl: </strong>Nope. I played video games with my friends and ate tacos.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Still better. What&apos;s the biggest difference between Earl Sweatshirt in 2009 and Earl Sweatshirt now?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.c"> I&apos;m fucking grown now. I was a little-ass kid in 2009. I&apos;ve figured shit out &#x2013; well not figured shit out. That&apos;s ridiculous. Not in some pretentious way, just as a result of time.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Same question, but this time for Thebe.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.e"> Same shit. I don&apos;t draw a line between them.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Let&apos;s talk about <em>Doris</em>. There&apos;s a lot of pretty overt talk of mental illness on the album. At one point in the track &quot;Sunday,&quot; you and Frank Ocean rap in unison, &quot;What good is West Coast weather if you&apos;re bipolar?&quot; At another point, in &quot;Burgundy,&quot; there&apos;s a voice-over that asks, &quot;Why you so depressed and sad all the time like a little bitch?&quot; How did your own experience with mental illness inform this album?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.g"> I don&apos;t know about mental illness, but I&apos;m a sad bitch sometimes. That&apos;s the shit I&apos;m more attracted to, so even if I&apos;m not, the shit that gets me excited is all very moody and unstable. That&apos;s some shit that I don&apos;t even see changing. Like, I can&apos;t make that good of music when I&apos;m happy. Some shit has to happen that either pisses me off or that&apos;s very grave.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>It&apos;s a really personal record &#x2013; very different, content-wise, from <em>Earl</em>.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.i"> Yeah. I didn&apos;t know how to say anything [back in 2010]. I didn&apos;t know how to keep a thought focused when I was young, and it kind of sounds like that. Like, it&apos;s tight or whatever, but it&apos;s just all over the place. I&apos;m still figuring that shit out. I feel like that&apos;s probably my next thing &#x2013; focusing more. Because I can do it when I&apos;m <em>writing. </em>That&apos;s probably better for the music anyway, when it&apos;s more impulsive.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong><em>Doris</em> is still impulsive, but it&apos;s far less abrasive than <em>Earl</em>. I tried to count how many times there&apos;s a reference to raping or killing someone on <em>Earl</em>, and I just gave up.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.k"> I&apos;m an adult. I can&apos;t be fucking talking about raping people and shit. That shit&apos;s crazy. As an adult, if you want to talk about rape, there&apos;s certain shit that comes along with it.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>As part of your program in Samoa, you worked with victims of sexual assault, yes?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.m"> Yeah, so you get to see that side of the fence, and then it&apos;s just fucked. That&apos;s what I&apos;m saying. That fully draws the line, where it&apos;s like you can stand on either side. Either you&apos;re a fool that is down with fucked up shit &#x2013; I mean, I&apos;m a fan of macabre shit, you know what I&apos;m saying? But not like that. At the end of the day, I&apos;m not some evil guy.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>Was there a crucial moment you realized that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.o"> It was instant. There was nothing you could do when you&apos;re looking at a fucking little girl that&apos;s been horribly abused. It doesn&apos;t even need to be gradual. And there was never a moment where I was trying to fucking perpetrate like I was some [rapist]. I still have so much fun performing <em>Earl</em>. That shit was what it was. That was our way of like, screaming. That was <em>my</em> way of screaming, because I don&apos;t yell.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.p">Any subject, whether it&apos;s raping people or swag or some fucking shoes or something &#x2013; if you rap about it enough, it&apos;s going to get boring. It was sick.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>Do you worry that not dealing with the same things that <em>Earl</em> dealt with will make you less appealing to people who loved all that rape and murder?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.r"> I don&apos;t care. Hey, one thing I&apos;ve learned in this past year is that motherfuckers are really stupid. There&apos;s a lot of really retarded people. That&apos;s not being a dick or anything; that&apos;s some real life shit. Like, I&apos;ve actually been amazed.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>You&apos;re pretty upfront about dealing with addiction issues on <em>Doris</em>. Was it something you were struggling with before you left for Samoa?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.t"> Yeah, it was before I left. Now I can go through these awesome little two-week things where &#x2013; well, not anymore because I don&apos;t have time to &#x2013; but when I didn&apos;t have to do shit, I could go through two-week things where I could just get fucked up and then explore that, and then be done with that when I got over it. Then make some sick music.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.u">Nothing extreme, though. It&apos;s 2013 and everyone smokes weed, and I don&apos;t want to be that one guy that&apos;s like &quot;Dude, I<em> smoke weed</em>.&quot; But I was very high for a <em>really long time,</em> just to see what that was like. When I recorded the bulk of the album, I got so skinny because I was smoking weed and drinking Red Bull and smoking cigarettes. And I&apos;d eat Chick-fil-A like once every 12 hours.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>This is after you&apos;re back?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.w"> Yeah.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>OK. But if addiction is one of the things you were hoping to address by going away, and then you get back and do this sort of thing, is your relationship to this stuff at all different?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.y"> Hell yeah! I just know what the fuck I&apos;m doing now. That&apos;s why I&apos;m not mad that I went away. A lot of niggas don&apos;t figure out the shit that I had to figure out until they&apos;re like 30 years old. I don&apos;t get attached to [drugs] anymore. I know the signs. Going away basically put tools in my toolbox. So I know how to use the shit &#x2013; so if there&apos;s any red flags or anything, it&apos;s just like &quot;alright.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>What does a red flag look like?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.10"> I don&apos;t know. If I&apos;m doing some shit too much. I did some stupid shit when I was recording. And I&apos;ll probably do some stupid shit when I record the next album, too. I&apos;m going to go to like London or something. Fucking <em>Trainspotting</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong>One thing that&apos;s stayed similar on the two albums is this dynamic you and Tyler have on songs where you&apos;re both featured. He&apos;s got a sort of big-brother complex &#x2013; half protective, half intimidating. Are you competitive in any other ways? Skateboarding?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.12"> No. I&apos;m way better at skating than Tyler. He skates better transition than I do, but I skate way better. Because he&apos;s too goofy.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>Arm wrestling?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.14"> He&apos;ll <em>fuck</em> <em>me up</em> at arm wrestling. That fool&apos;s a fucking freak athlete. I hate him. He&apos;s fucking good at everything. I don&apos;t like it.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>Who got a better SAT score?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.16"> Ha! I got a fucking better SAT score. This is the thing: I know I&apos;m more eloquent than Tyler is. Like as far as school and shit goes, I&apos;m technically better than him. But that&apos;s a smart nigga. That&apos;s a very smart man right there. He&apos;s also a fucking idiot.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.17"><strong>One thing that&apos;s really compelling about your return is that you&apos;ve sort of bypassed all of the shitty parts about being a rapper. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.18"> I bypassed a lot. I also missed the sick part of it too, though. Like, I didn&apos;t get to fully live in the world where we were still mysterious, like when we were cracking &#x2013; when we were blowing up more, but not on a level where little girls would fuck with us. It was still kind of scary. I missed that. It was charged with dark energy.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.19"><strong>After you went away, you made it pretty clear that you weren&apos;t forced away &#x2013; that the decision was the right one for you. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> I mean, I <em>had</em> to get forced away. But yeah, like I said, end result: I wasn&apos;t mad.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><strong>Was there a moment before leaving where things got so bad that you realized you needed to go?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> I didn&apos;t even give a fuck. I was <em>so </em>heated when I went. And I was heated right after I went. And for like a year. I don&apos;t know if there was a moment when I realized shit was best for me, but my mom was just like &#x2013; I was just fighting her back and forth all night on why the &quot;Free Earl&quot; shit wasn&apos;t fucked up or whatever. Every week, you&apos;d meet with the therapist and talk to your parents. She was telling me she was afraid to go to work and she was having trouble getting dressed in the morning &#x2013; to like get up and go to work and shit. She just didn&apos;t know what to do. I guess it&apos;s just one of those things where the line is drawn. You get to stand on either side of it. That was a fucked-up feeling.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><strong>You mentioned tools in your toolbox before. What were some of the other things you found most useful during your time away?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> I learned how to be patient. Some of the worst kids ever were there. <em>Ever</em>. No words could describe what it was like living twenty-four-seven with someone who, on the outside, you would vocalize your hate for. You have to live with him; you have no other option, you know what I mean? Like, your option is you either put up with some shit that you don&apos;t want to put up with, or stay till you&apos;re fucking twenty-one years old.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><strong>Who determined that you were ready to go? How did that work?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> The therapist. There&apos;s like a level system that you have to work through. So you come in at a level one, and you leave at a level six. It&apos;s basically left up to you how long it takes to get through the shit. You don&apos;t have anything at level one. You don&apos;t have shit. You can&apos;t go to the bathroom by yourself. Then you slowly work your way through the level system and you get more privileges, more independence.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><strong>Were you quick to work through those levels?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1i"> Hell no! I was terrible. I was awful. For that whole year that I was talking about, I was the worst. I became the one example that people give. Like, when I came in, they always give new kids the examples like, &quot;Now if you want to leave here, you act like <em>him</em>. You don&apos;t want to be like <em>him.</em>&quot; After a year, I was the &quot;you <em>don&apos;t </em>want to be like him.&quot; I actually couldn&apos;t believe it. I turned into that one guy. I hated everything. If I thought I didn&apos;t like shit when I was at home, I really learned how to be a real piece of shit that hated myself and literally everything.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1j">After that year happened, I convinced myself that home wasn&apos;t real, that it was a figment of my imagination &#x2013; that I was going to die there. Because as far as I was concerned, I was like, &quot;What the fuck can you show me of home?&quot; When I closed my eyes and opened them, all I see is the palm trees.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1k"><strong>And yet here you are. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1l"> I was like, &quot;I want to go home.&quot; And it&apos;s entirely up to you. That&apos;s what I realized. For that whole year, I was like, &quot;You motherfuckers gonna keep me here?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1m"><strong>Do you ever worry that the more individual success Odd Future members get, the harder it will be to stay cohesive as a unit?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1n"> We&apos;ll see with time, but yeah. That&apos;s a fucking weird thing to think about. Wild. I don&apos;t worry too much, because everyone was friends before we did music. So with or without music, everyone&apos;s still going to be straight. Odd Future&apos;s like a network, as opposed to like a rap group. I mean, obviously it&apos;s a rap group. But still, there&apos;s a lot of other shit going on than a bunch of fools that rap together.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1o"><strong>How do you keep things close? Group meditations? Sweat lodges?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1p"> We&apos;ve got the [Odd Future] store, and we&apos;re trying to make this vacation shit we do a yearly thing. We went to Hawaii last year. Everyone went to Hawaii. So tight. It was <em>so tight</em>. I was shrooming for like three days [he makes the sort of wide-eyed, happy zombie face one makes when pantomiming a psilocybin-laced beach vacation]. But I&apos;ve got a girlfriend now. I can&apos;t do that shit around my girlfriend. Oh, man.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1q"><strong>Where&apos;d you meet?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1r"> They [Tyler and other Odd Future members] were out here, and they were in a restaurant somewhere, and this girl and my girlfriend walked by. I wasn&apos;t even out here. Tyler got the one girl&apos;s number, and it turned out they lived in California. So then he hit her up while they were out there. They came to hang out with Tyler one time. I met that girl, and I thought she was hell-of annoying at first, and then somehow that shit worked out. I don&apos;t know. She got my number. I don&apos;t know how. She got my number and texted me.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1s">I&apos;m not an asshole anymore, either. She&apos;s making me fucking soft. It&apos;s like we&apos;re married, dude. I smoke weed like a fucking scared dad [He takes a few hasty puffs of an imaginary joint, his eyes darting back and forth]. I&apos;m like, &quot;Keep that outside!&quot; And she&apos;s not even pressing me. I&apos;m just paranoid.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1t"><strong>But you&apos;re happy.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1u"> Yeah. See, when I start recording new shit then I&apos;ve got to like stall her out for a second. Because she makes me too happy. Shit won&apos;t work out.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1v"><strong>On the final verse of the last song on <em>Doris</em>, you rap &quot;Young, black, and jaded/hazy vision strolling through the night.&quot; Was that meant to be a sort of synopsis?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1w"> That&apos;s a pretty perfect summation of where I&apos;m at most of the time. Like, kind of aloof and salty. And also young and black.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1x"><strong>Last question. There&apos;s a poem about you, written in 1995 by your family friend Sterling Plumpp, called &quot;Poet: for </strong><strong>Thebe Neruda.&quot; It ends this way: </strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1y">**&quot;You</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.1z"> were born with blues.</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.20"> With an ANC [African National Congress] imprint</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.21"> on them. How you gon</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.22"> do anything but rule?&quot;**</p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.23"><strong>Do you feel fated to do what you do?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.4.24"> I still have a hard time recognizing that you&apos;re good at something and not being a fucking dickhead. A lot of times, a lot of really talented people are dickheads. So I still have to get comfortable. My friends have to remind me that it&apos;s OK to own the fact that you&apos;re good at something. I think it&apos;ll just come with getting older. But I don&apos;t ever want to be a fucking asshole. So until I feel like I&apos;m able to find that balance &#x2013; of not being a prick and fully owning the fact that I maybe am very good at something &#x2013; I&apos;m very tired by it. Because a lot of times, it&apos;s a very, very thin line.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".9320zonuv4.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col
