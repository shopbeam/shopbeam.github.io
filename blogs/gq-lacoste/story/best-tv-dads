  	    "articleBody": "Several weeks ago, I took my twin sons, age seven, to Target. My wife was at home with the baby so it was just the three of us. We were walking through the parking lot and I was fiddling with my phone making fun of Dwyane Wade on Twitter or whatever and some old lady pulled up next to us and rolled down her window. She was smiling this bright, warm old-lady smile, and she said, \u0022I just want to say that you\u0027re doing a great job. I love seeing dads out with their kids. Great job. Just great.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd then she drove away. That was it. That was the whole encounter: Her telling me I was a wonderful dad while I was paying literally ZERO attention to the boys. For real, I was just walking and tap-tap-tapping on my phone like a true champion. I didn\u0027t even know where one of them was. He was like two aisles over climbing into the back of a parked pickup truck or something. And I\u0027m a hero to this lady. And this wasn\u0027t some bizarro thing either—this probably happens 60 percent of the time we go somewhere without my wife. If I have all three of them with me, if the baby is strapped to my chest, too, oh man—close the streets off, because I\u0027m about to get my own parade.\u000A\u000AThe point is, people say being a dad is hard, but it\u0027s not. It can be frustrating and tedious and annoying and stupid, but so are you—so it\u0027s an even swap. Just be around. That\u0027s a Dad Level 1 advancement right there.\u000A\u000AQuick aside: A Dad Level is the level at which a man is operating as a dad. The higher your level, the more transcendent you are. You unlock Dad Levels the same way you unlock ox Achievements: by completing various dad missions and dad tasks. Your car got a flat and you were smart enough to pack all the supplies you need to change it in eight minutes? Cool. Nice. That\u0027s a Dad Level 2 achievement. Your car got a flat and you weren\u0027t smart enough to pack all the supplies you\u0027d need so you ended up changing it with a piece of iron you found on the side of the road? Even better. That\u0027s a Dad Level 5 achievement. The lowest you can be rated is Dad Level 0, which is where all first-time dads start out. The highest you can go is Dad Level 10. That\u0027s a battle-tested, veteran dad. There have only ever been two Dad Level 10\u0027s: God, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1985\u0027s Commando.\u000A\u000AAnd so, for the full spectrum: here are the ten best dads on TV right now, ranked by their individual Dad Levels.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A10. Javier Delgado from _Modern Family\u000A\u000A _Dad Level 1\u000A\u000AYou maybe don\u0027t remember Benjamin Bratt as Javier Delgado because he plays a bit role and he\u0027s only been in a handful of episodes. He\u0027s there though. He\u0027s Manny\u0027s absentee father, a former minor league baseball player and bullfighter and horse bettor. Truth be told, Bratt\u0027s really not all that interesting or fun or even cool on the show, but when I started putting this Dope Dads list together it was basically eighteen white dads, so Bratt sneaks on here via Affirmative Action. I have to assume that this is the feeblest application of that policy. Sorry, White America.\u000A\u000A*Or maybe because you stopped watching the show after the second episode because that\u0027s about the time they started running out of ideas.\u000A\u000A**It\u0027s cool that the only Latino dad on the show is the one that isn\u0027t around to take care of his kid. \u000A\u000A***He also sneaks on here—and any other list he wants—because he played Paco Aguilar in Blood In, Blood Out, the greatest movie of my lifetime.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A9. The Mountain from _Game of Thrones\u000A\u000A _Dad Level 2\u000A\u000AOkay, now, to be clear, they\u0027ve never shown The Mountain with any children on Game of Thrones*. But I have to assume that, given his affinity for rape and just general mayhem, he has a handful of gigantic children spread all across Westeros and Essos. Can you even imagine how terrible birthing a Baby Mountain would be? That\u0027d be like giving birth to a refrigerator. Those babies gotta be born at like 5\u00275\u0022, 140 pounds. A Baby Mountain being born is like when you take a banana out its peel. :(\u000A\u000A*If you want to be a stickler, we can plug Tywin Lannister in The Mountain\u0027s spot. He\u0027s definitely displayed some very dope Dad Traits.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A8. Don Draper from _Mad Men\u000A\u000A _Dad Level 3\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s Don Draper, bro. You already know.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A7. Frank Gallagher from _Shameless\u000A\u000A _Dad Level 3\u000A\u000AAll that you need to know about Frank Gallagher (played by William H. Macy) as a dad: There\u0027s a scene in the first season where Phillip, one of his sons and real true genius, is so irritated with Frank that he urinates on him. That\u0027s the highest level of Dad Irritation. It\u0027s rarified air. I hope to one day reach that level.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A6. Frank Reynolds from _It\u0027s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u000A\u000A _Dad Level 3\u000A\u000AThis is Frank (played by Danny DeVito) with his two children, Dee and Dennis, hearing their mom\u0027s will being read by a lawyer:\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe only thing that brings you closer to your kids than loving things together is hating things together. Real bonding happening here.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A5. Jax Teller from _Sons of Anarchy\u000A\u000A _Dad Level 4\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s the president of the Sons of Anarchy, the only MC that\u0027s ever really mattered. He\u0027s killed men and he\u0027s maimed men and he\u0027s destroyed men, which makes him terrifying, which is a vital Dad Trait*. He rides a motorcycle and he has a haunted past and perfect hair and the perfect Smolder Face (nobody has ever been better at looking angry than Jax Teller). He\u0027s smart and capable and overflowing with love and hate. He might be the perfect dad.\u000A\u000A*If you have sons, you need to spend, like, at least 80 percent of your Dad Energy making sure that they grow up afraid of you. My boys are only seven but I already see them plotting against me, planning for the perfect moment to overtake my rule of the house. You won\u0027t be stronger than your sons forever so you have to plant that seed in their brains early. Sometimes I wake my sons up in the middle of night, like around three or four a.m., then just lean over their bed and whisper, \u0022Ay. You know I\u0027m gonna fuck you up, right?\u0022 And then I kiss them on their foreheads and walk out of the room into the darkness. It\u0027s warfare and it\u0027s real.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A4. Walter White from _Breaking Bad\u000A\u000A _Dad Level 4\u000A\u000ANow, yes, I know that this show ended last year and that everyone thought that Walter White was dead. But Bryan Cranston hinted in an interview with CNN\u0027s Ashleigh Banfield in May that maybe White didn\u0027t really die and that maybe the show wasn\u0027t really over forever and that maybe we\u0027d see him again and so, duh, White\u0027s here. What a wonderful dad, he was as Walt/Heisenberg. He loved his family but he loved his ego more, and that\u0027s maybe the most Dad thing of all*.\u000A\u000A*One time I made my sons watch me play Mortal Kombat III for, like, almost two straight hours while I tried to beat Shao Kahn, the game\u0027s final level boss. I think I lost something like 30 or 40 times in a row. They were like, \u0022Daddy, can we go to bed? We\u0027re tired.\u0022 I was like, \u0022No. You sit there and watch me until I beat this guy. You never give up.\u0022 They were crying. I was crying. It was this whole big thing. When I finally beat him, I was jumping around, pounding myself on the chest. \u0022See? You see that?! You can do anything in this life, boys! Anything you set your mind to!\u0022 I literally said \u0022You can do anything in this life, boys!\u0022 Because I beat Mortal Kombat III. That\u0027s a little thing called teaching your sons real values. \u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A3. Neil deGrasse _Tyson from Cosmos\u000A\u000A _Dad Level 5\u000A\u000AHis show isn\u0027t a show like the rest of these shows but Neil deGrasse Tyson is a dad in real life and he\u0027s also a very dope scientist so he gets included. It\u0027s probably so cool to have Tyson as your dad. All of the questions you have get real, actual answers. You don\u0027t realize how much stuff you don\u0027t know until you have a couple of four-year-olds lobbing trivia at you. You know what I do when my sons ask me something and I don\u0027t know the answer? I just make some shit up because how are they gonna know that I\u0027m wrong? They don\u0027t know about the Internet yet. That\u0027s the thing my dad did to me and it\u0027s the thing my sons will do with their kids. \u0022What\u0027s the difference between a frog and a toad? Oh, um, well, a frog lives in the lake and a toad lives in the ocean.\u0022 That\u0027s a thing that I actually said once even though I was 100 percent certain it was wrong. For the next few years, my sons are going to think toads live in the Pacific. Now every time we go to the beach I gotta be like, \u0022Put your sunscreen on, and make sure you watch out for ocean toads. They\u0027re mating right now so they\u0027re more aggressive than usual.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A2. Ron Swanson from _Parks and Recreation\u000A\u000A _Dad Level 6\u000A\u000AHe didn\u0027t become a dad on the show until recently. Still, he has always had a Dad Spirit. Some wonderful dad-like things that he\u0027s said on P&amp;R:\u000A\u000A\u0022Crying: Acceptable at funerals and the Grand Canyon.\u0022\u000A\u000AMy sons are seven. They\u0027ve still never seen me cry. I don\u0027t imagine they will for my whole life.\u000A\u000A\u0022There\u0027s only one thing I hate more than lying. Skim milk. Which is water that\u0027s lying about being milk.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Don\u0027t teach a man to fish and feed yourself. He\u0027s a grown man. Fishing\u0027s not that hard.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe first time my son caught a fish all by himself it was four inches long and he hooked it through the belly by accident. It was my best day as a father.\u000A\u000A\u0022Under my tutelage, you will grow from boys to men. From men into gladiators. And from gladiators into Swansons.\u0022\u000A\u000AIf you\u0027re not drilling it into your kids\u0027 brains that your family is the greatest family then why are you even a dad?\u000A\u000A\u0022Fishing relas me. It\u0027s like yoga, except I still get to kill something.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen asked if he ercised: \u0022Yes. Lovemaking and woodworking.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat a true American hero.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A1. Louis C.K. from _Louie\u000A\u000A _Dad Level 6\u000A\u000AThis is a perfect thing:\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s this scene during the third season where his younger daughter (she\u0027s probably around 9) is in the living room by herself playing the violin. This is something she does remarkably well. It\u0027s amazing, really. Mesmerizing, even. The camera pans in and around slowly as she plays. She\u0027s so focused and determined and flawless and it\u0027s just this great, beautiful thing that she\u0027s able to do with her tiny little girl arms and hands and spongy brain. And after about 48 seconds of her doing this gorgeous and impressive thing, you see Louie materialize in the background, frumpy and frustrated, holding a load of laundry. And he shuts that whole shit down. He shouts, \u0022Stop it! Stop it. It\u0027s not time to do that right now.\u0022 She pauses for a second, then responds, \u0022But it\u0027s beautiful.\u0022 And he bucks back, taking her violin and sending her to her room. The name of that particular episode is \u0022Dad.\u0022\u000A\u000ALouis C.K. is a king.",

data-reactid=".24rl8phrg8w.1.1.0.0.3"></h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".24rl8phrg8w.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".24rl8phrg8w.1.1.0.0.4.0">Several weeks ago, I took my twin sons, age seven, to Target. My wife was at home with the baby so it was just the three of us. We were walking through the parking lot and I was fiddling with my phone making fun of Dwyane Wade on Twitter or whatever and some old lady pulled up next to us and rolled down her window. She was smiling this bright, warm old-lady smile, and she said, &quot;I just want to say that you&apos;re doing a great job. I love seeing dads out with their kids. Great job. Just great.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".24rl8phrg8w.1.1.0.0.4.1">And then she drove away. That was it. That was the whole encounter: Her telling me I was a wonderful dad while I was paying literally ZERO attention to the boys. For real, I was just walking and tap-tap-tapping on my phone like a true champion. I didn&apos;t even know where one of them was. He was like two aisles over climbing into the back of a parked pickup truck or something. And I&apos;m a hero to this lady. And this wasn&apos;t some bizarro thing either&#x2014;this probably happens 60 percent of the time we go somewhere without my wife. If I have all three of them with me, if the baby is strapped to my chest, too, oh man&#x2014;close the streets off, because I&apos;m about to get my own parade.</p><p data-reactid=".24rl8phrg8w.1.1.0.0.4.2">The point is, people say being a dad is hard, but it&apos;s not. It can be frustrating and tedious and annoying and stupid, but so are you&#x2014;so it&apos;s an even swap. Just be around. That&apos;s a Dad Level 1 advancement right there.</p><p data-reactid=".24rl8phrg8w.1.1.0.0.4.3">Quick aside: A Dad Level is the level at which a man is operating as a dad. The higher your level, the more transcendent you are. You unlock Dad Levels the same way you unlock ox Achievements: by completing various dad missions and dad tasks. Your car got a flat and you were smart enough to pack all the supplies you need to change it in eight minutes? Cool. Nice. That&apos;s a Dad Level 2 achievement. Your car got a flat and you <em>weren&apos;t</em> smart enough to pack all the supplies you&apos;d need so you ended up changing it with a piece of iron you found on the side of the road? Even better. That&apos;s a Dad Level 5 achievement. The lowest you can be rated is Dad Level 0, which is where all first-time dads start out. The highest you can go is Dad Level 10. That&apos;s a battle-tested, veteran dad. There have only ever been two Dad Level 10&apos;s: God, and Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1985&apos;s <em>Commando</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".24rl8phrg8w.1.1.0.0.4.5">And so, for the full spectrum: here are the ten best dads on TV right now, ranked by their individual Dad Levels.</p><p data-reactid=".24rl8phrg8w.1.1.0.0.4.6">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".24rl8phrg8w.1.1.0.0.4.7"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55828be8e52bc4b477a97e22/master/w_806/blogs-the-feed-javier-delgado-modern-family.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-javier-delgado-modern-family.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbest-tv-dads&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-javier-delgado-modern-family.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbest-tv-dads&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-javier-delgado-modern-family.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbest-tv-dads&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828be8e52bc4b477a97e22%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-javier-delgado-modern-family.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-javier-delgado-modern-family.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbest-tv-dads&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828be8e52bc4b477a97e22%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-javier-delgado-modern-family.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-javier-delgado-modern-family.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".24rl8phrg8w.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>10.

It&apos;s probably so cool to have Tyson as your dad. All of the questions you have get real, actual answers. You don&apos;t realize how much stuff you don&apos;t know until you have a couple of four-year-olds lobbing trivia at you. You know what I do when my sons ask me something and I don&apos;t know the answer? I just make some shit up because how are they gonna know that I&apos;m wrong? They don&apos;t know about the Internet yet. That&apos;s the thing my dad did to me and it&apos;s the thing my sons will do with their kids. &quot;What&apos;s the difference between a frog and a toad? Oh, um, well, a frog lives in the lake and a toad lives in the ocean.&quot; That&apos;s a thing that I actually said once even though I was 100 percent certain it was wrong. For the next few years, my sons are going to think toads live in the Pacific. Now every time we go to the beach I gotta be like, &quot;Put your sunscreen on, and make sure you watch out for ocean toads.

And after about 48 seconds of her doing this gorgeous and impressive thing, you see Louie materialize in the background, frumpy and frustrated, holding a load of laundry.
