  	    "articleBody": "When you come upon the luckiest village in the world, all the curtains are drawn. The old man outside the bar gazes at you warily. Then he disappears inside, the door slapping shut. Is it that you\u0027re painted magenta? Is it that your rays are blinding?\u000A\u000A You\u0027re painted magenta and your rays are blinding.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The lucky village of Sodeto, in the kingdom of Aragon, is a cluster of sensible houses spackled together off the main road, curtained behind a pine copse. The village, with its 250 inhabitants, climbs a slight incline to the church at its height, the bell tower rising in a solid bulk. Tractors clog the main thoroughfare. The earth that surrounds the village is orange and packed hard, though grass sprouts in the village square. The tranquillity is cloying, a lazy silence.\u000A\u000A Not even the dogs work up much gumption to bark around here.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The song that the innocent children sing onstage in faraway Madrid—wearing their pleated gray skirts, slacks, and ties with blue stripes, dressed in the garb of Catholic-school students—is one that warms a Spanish heart but sounds like the creepy refrain before everyone gets offed in a slasher movie. It\u0027s the plaintive ode of two children singing in disconnected, ethereal voices. Their strangling falsettos vine up around each other, singing not about innocent things like love or country, God or glory. They sing out the numbers, as they have for the past 200 years: \u0022Cincuenta y ocho mil, dos cientos sesenta y ocho.\u0022 And then: \u0022Cuatro millones de euros.\u0022 \u000A\u000A During this, Spain\u0027s economic apocalypse, they\u0027re singing about money, and all that it brings.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The year is 2011: The real estate and banking bubbles have burst. One out of four is out of work—5 million total—tumbled into an abyss. People march in the streets, turn hungry and hard, glinting with leaden light. Some leave the country in search of jobs. For each percent increase in unemployment comes a 1 percent increase in suicides.\u000A\u000A In the village of Sodeto, the little school has recently been closed. There are mortgage worries, a bad harvest, and water shortages caused by less and less melted water trickling from the Pyrenees.\u000A\u000A Everyone has trickled here, too, scatterlings drawn like filings to the magnet. Unlike other Spanish villages, Sodeto is quite young—just sixty years old and full of transplants. Sandra, the ever optimistic one, went from Blanes to London to New York to Athens, where she met a man named Costis, spent three years in an RV crisscrossing the Continent before being called here. The towering man named Fran, who lost everything in Barcelona, has come here to make himself clean with his wife and two young kids, humbling himself for any work. Ana, the Romanian who runs Sodeto\u0027s bar, arrived ten years ago to pick strawberries, but with the crisis, no one comes to the bar anymore. She has enough to eat, but with holes in her socks, not much after that.\u000A\u000A Now a man hangs himself in Granada when they come to evict him from his home. Another spreads his arms and leaps, but rather than fly, hurtles to earth. In the village, few go to church anymore, though a group still gathers to clean it once a month, a gesture, a vestige from the past, not to be confused with faith.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A El Gordo is the name given to the oldest lottery jackpot in the world—and the richest. Held every year in Madrid on December 22, the Christmas Lottery culminates with the picking of the El Gordo number, the Fat One, which, for many, has become the true Christmas miracle in Spain. In the year of our Lord, Anno Domini, 2011, the tickets bear a painting of the Virgin Mary in red and gold robes, visited by a hovering choir of angels. Joseph and Mary have traveled miles through the Judaean desert in winter—in fear of bears and boars, wearing heavy woolen robes, in the rain and cold—and now it\u0027s time for her to give birth. Unto this world will come a baby to absolve us of our sins. It\u0027s a nice story, but the lottery jackpot is 720 million euros. Seventy percent of all Spaniards play to win, spending, on average, seventy euros apiece. People visit clairvoyants and fortune-tellers, plead for the winning number.\u000A\u000A At the appointed hour in faraway Madrid, lottery officials take their seats behind a long table on the stage of the Teatro Real. A gauntlet of media cameras fills the front row. The children appear in blue and gray. Behind them are two dramatic globes—one large, one smaller—made of golden mesh. Inside the large globe are wooden balls the size of acorns, each lasered with a five-digit number, while the smaller globe contains acorn-balls lasered with money amounts.\u000A\u000A Is it preordained that some of us shall remain lost in the desert, or the orange-clay farmlands of northern Spain? Should the ball spin with our number, what then? Might we be plucked from this oblivion and found again?\u000A\u000A Luck is a drowning and a rebirth. Is the cosmic flash. The second chance.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A In Sodeto, the windows are shuttered fast. Morning, and the farmers are in the fields. Others have risen and begun to prepare the Christmas feast. Plucking the duck. Slaughtering sheep. The mayor, Rosa, futzes in the kitchen, her lapdog, Homer, eating scraps. Through the window, her neighbor, Sandra, and her bushel of tangled blond hair, drives off to work, forty-five minutes to Huesca.\u000A\u000A There\u0027s something about this landscape of Aragon: Gliding over its orange plains, through its rocky crags, unloosens memory. Sandra\u0027s drive to work is this rush of remembrance: the beach town of Blanes, where her parents ran a British pub—the place she grew up as a green-eyed girl, listening to the tourists speaking English, to Pink Floyd on the stereo—and where her mother died when she was 10. She recalls how her difficult father remarried, how he did nothing but tear her down, and how he kicked her out when she was 18. Her grandmother from Sodeto was the only one who cared. But the girl was unsettled and ran, meeting Costis in Greece, falling in love. In love with Costis, that way he carried his lithe body without a care in the world. Buying an RV on eBay, throwing over their office jobs, then traveling for three years without a plan, from Greek islands to Albania. With Costis, to Turkey, Italy, Austria. Realizing that what she loved in him was the thing that would later force them to split as lovers: his lack of concern—his absolute passivity—about what tomorrow might bring, about anything practical. But it had been there right from the start. He never hid it, didn\u0027t have the energy. He was exactly who he was. Authentically himself.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A __\u000A\u000A When, on a Christmas visit to Sodeto, Sandra learned her beloved grandmother was dying of cancer, she stayed to care for her in the village of Luck. Two weeks later, her grandmother died.\u000A\u000A Sandra, the disowned daughter, never left.\u000A\u000A And though they separated, nor did Costis, the carefree. Costis, the brokenhearted.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Like every other year, Carmen, the most active member of the Housewives\u0027 Association in Sodeto, has driven six miles to the lottery office in Grañén—the one owned by Pilar and Fortunato—and studied all the tickets draped in the window, letting the digits flow through her mind. The government prints tickets bearing the numbers 0 to 99,999 and distributes them to offices like these across the country. A ticket, or billete, costs 200 euros, but because many can\u0027t afford that, it\u0027s broken into tenths, known as décimos, costing twenty euros apiece—and even these are often then broken into quarter décimos, for five euros apiece. In the little villages, a civic organization like, say, the Housewives\u0027 Association of Sodeto, will buy a reel of tickets and sell the quarter décimos, or \u0022tickets of participation,\u0022 door-to-door to raise money to help the town—to sponsor a town event or build a small park. Five euros (plus an extra euro donated to the Housewives) gets you into a game offering a .001 percent chance of winning El Gordo. Anyone who answers the door is likely to buy at least one ticket, out of obligation or guilt. But some buy three, some five, fifteen, more.\u000A\u000A This day Carmen purchases 6,000 euros\u0027 worth of the series marked 58268—1,200 quarter-décimo tickets of participation in all—then she and several board members of the Association go door to door, shilling. They knock in their sister village of Alberuela, too. In total, the Housewives sell 1,196 tickets, with nearly everyone in Sodeto and neighboring Alberuela buying some.\u000A\u000A The tickets end up taped to the fridge, slipped in a drawer, left near a stack of mail, forgotten. For most, it\u0027s part of the Christmas ritual—and a donation—but in these bleak times, some murmur a little prayer to the tickets fanned in their hand, asking for one wish to be granted. In this life that has given so little, the residents of Sodeto know better than to expect anything. But that doesn\u0027t stop some from a moment\u0027s entertainment, from wondering: What if the wish came true? \u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Rosa, the mayor, is in the kitchen, her mutt, Homer, eating the scraps. Sandra is at work. Costis, the carefree, is sleeping in the house where he lives just outside of town, in the fields. Sandra\u0027s new—much younger—shepherd boyfriend (he\u0027s 21; she\u0027s 35) is slaughtering sheep, and José, a farmer with dark sideburns, is in his tractor, plowing the fields that will grow again with rice, alfalfa, and corn come spring. Marisol, the hairdresser, is at the dentist, and Paco, her husband, is killing time, running errands in town until her appointment is over. Ana, the Romanian, is upstairs, over the bar, getting ready to go down and open for no one.\u000A\u000A The Christmas Lottery begins at 9 a.m. and includes several lesser drawings. El Gordo maybe gets announced three hours in, but it\u0027s only 9:57 a.m., and—what\u0027s this?—already the announcer is bruiting Olé, olé, olé, as the girl and boy, bespectacled, walk across the stage of the Teatro Real holding the acorns for El Gordo aloft, singing their strangled notes.\u000A\u000A Rosa\u0027s not even watching this but halfway listening on the radio. Nine fifty- seven a.m. That\u0027s early, she tells herself. A voice says the number, and then says that it originated from the lottery office in the village of Grañén. Where is that little village? asks the announcer. And Rosa almost answers: On the Monegros plain, in Aragon! Then the number is said aloud—58268— as she goes for her ticket in a panic...could it be?—then calls her friend Carmen, of the Housewives\u0027 Association. Pero que? Pero que? Could it be? she is yelling, and Carmen says, \u0022Yes, we\u0027ve WON. We\u0027ve WON El Gordo.\u0022\u000A\u000A Rosa throws on an overcoat and sprints across the square for town hall. There\u0027s a PA system there, one she uses only to announce water shortages or power outages. Now, hands shaking, she flips on the power, takes the microphone, and speaks, her voice crackling from speakers in the square. \u0022Congratulations, Sodeto,\u0022 she says as calmly as she can. \u0022We have just WON THE LOTTERY! Come to the plaza in order to celebrate.\u0022\u000A\u000A Then she races home to put on nicer clothes.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Ana, the Romanian, picks up the ringing phone. \u0022Mommy,\u0022 says her daughter, \u0022apparently the Gordo was won in Grañén,\u0022 and Ana says, \u0022Is this a joke?\u0022 She looks out the window and sees her friend Lolita in her pajamas, running to the mayor\u0027s house, and she sticks her head out, and Lolita screams, \u0022WE WON THE GORDO!\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022How much?\u0022 asks Ana reflexively, and her friend says a number in pesetas, and Ana yells, \u0022Tell me so I can understand!\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022One hundred thousand euros per ticket,\u0022 she shouts.\u000A\u000A And Ana, in shock, races down to the bar. She remembers putting her ticket under the cash register, and where is it, and...\u000A\u000A There it is! \u000A\u000A Her mouth opens, but nothing comes out.\u000A\u000A Then she\u0027s running out into the square, among the lucky ones, who are dancing and hugging, uncorking bottles of champagne that they\u0027ve taken double-handed from the shelves of the village store without paying. Ana keeps looking up at the sky, then covers her ears as if protecting them from a thunderclap, overwhelmed.\u000A\u000A So this is that just reward for those who work so hard. Others are looking up, too, tears in their eyes, lips moving, speaking to the clouds.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Sandra, the disowned daughter, picks up her phone at work. It\u0027s her boyfriend, the shepherd boy: Have you heard? \u000A\u000A And...what? This cannot be true, cannot be...except it seems to be, because his voice sounds funny, pitched with excitement. She believes she bought a ticket. Did she? Yes, of course. And where might she have put it?\u000A\u000A Joder! \u000A\u000A Her boss gives her the day, and she careens through the same landscape she traveled an hour ago, and by the time she returns to the village, a celebration has exploded. Everyone\u0027s in the square, with bottles of champagne, and she dips her head and carries on to her house, opens the gate, bursts through the door, and begins to hyperventilate. The ticket...where is the ticket? \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A __\u000A\u000A Back at the office, they\u0027re taking bets that there\u0027s no way she\u0027ll find it, that she threw it out, that it\u0027ll turn up twenty-five years from now at the bottom of a shoebox. Inside the house, she\u0027s tearing things from the cupboards, throwing over piles. Where? \u000A\u000A She dials her phone and reaches Costis, still bleary from sleep, in his house out in the fields. He works as a freelance filmmaker, but sometimes has to borrow from Sandra to make ends meet.\u000A\u000A \u0022Sodeto won El Gordo,\u0022 she screams, \u0022but I can\u0027t find my fucking ticket.\u0022 She\u0027s crying now. She\u0027s hysterical. She flings clothes and papers. Half an hour, forty minutes, searching, muttering, gripped by despair...\u000A\u000A Until she finds the slip—the Virgin in red and gold, the holy host of angels—tucked in the cabinet by the sink.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A In the dentist\u0027s chair, Marisol, the hairdresser, hears the Gordo song from a radio or television somewhere, the voices in their entwining aria. She thinks she hears a 68 at the end but believes her tickets end in 88. Alas. She\u0027s always had this fantasy that if she ever won the thing, she would be found in the yard, in a horrible hat, killing the Christmas turkey, plucking its feathers. The dentist enters, and she says, \u0022It sounds like the Gordo is out, true?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Yes,\u0022 he says. \u0022I\u0027m so happy for my good friend Fortunato. They say it came from his store in Grañén.\u0022\u000A\u000A Grañén? After having her teeth picked at and polished, Marisol pays and leaves. On the street, she calls Rosa, the mayor, just to see. \u0022Who won?\u0022 she asks. And when Rosa tells her—\u0022WE DID!\u0022—Marisol reacts like a headless turkey herself, ups and starts running. She\u0027s so nervous she doesn\u0027t know where at first—she just starts sprinting the streets of Huesca, and her husband, Paco, pulls up in the car with their son. And then her son is jumping out, yelling, WE WON THE GORDO! WE WON THE GORDO! All of them are hugging in the middle of the street until a policeman tells them to stop blocking traffic, to move along.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The first blinding glare of fortune is like a truth serum. Everyone is stripped and stunned by the honesty of the moment. Luck is childhood again, in the garden naked and innocent. How could this be? And then, arm in arm, hugging: Santos cojones, how many tickets did you have?\u000A\u000A Seven. One. Five. He has twelve. She, fifteen. She\u0027s worth 2 million; he, 600,000; she, 100,000.\u000A\u000A The Housewives, it turns out, sold tickets totaling 120 million euros in winnings, manna from heaven.\u000A\u000A Costis arrives, just out of bed, head shaved, in glasses, filming with his camera.\u000A\u000A How many? they yell at him, delirious. How many? And he doesn\u0027t understand the question at first. He doesn\u0027t really understand any of it, the enormity of it. He doesn\u0027t play the lottery. And so, great, you won 1,000 euros. Isn\u0027t this dancing-in-the-streets overreaching a little?\u000A\u000A Tickets, Costis, how many tickets do you have? \u000A\u000A Why would I have any tickets? he says.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The chosen ones are hugging and dancing in the square, beneath tassels of champagne spray, bottle after bottle—fifty...sixty...seventy...until no one\u0027s counting anymore. The media arrive within ten minutes of the Gordo announcement, beaming the lucky village to a country that needs some glimmer of hope: these lives, like so many in the country, that hung in the balance this morning now inexorably changed by luck, the farming village that has become instantly rich. But the media aren\u0027t the only ones. Strange cars roll into town, the bankers in sedans, the BMW dealer in a BMW. Who are these people? Travel agents and farm equipment salespeople, investment advisers and real estate agents, all of them seem to appear from behind the pine trees. Unheard of: people standing in the village square, wearing suits and ties, with briefcases.\u000A\u000A Who invited them?\u000A\u000A Who cares? \u000A\u000A By noon, twelve TV stations are set up near the square, radar dishes beaming. They were nobody, and now the whole country—the whole world—will know the name Sodeto.\u000A\u000A This, then, is the first stage of luck: being chosen. And this massive rush of ecstasy and disbelief at being chosen. Before everything that will come next, before they realize the full impact of their winnings, luck is a humble village, bound by mud and straw, touched by this bolt of light.\u000A\u000A Let them hear it, then: Sodeto, Sodeto, Sodeto. \u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A No one works in the first flush of celebration, except for the farmers with animals to feed. They only talk about their fortune, their enormous, unimaginable luck. You can\u0027t explain this, what it feels like to be born under charmed stars. For the cameras, the women all want to have their hair done, apply makeup. So Marisol, the hairdresser, works overtime at her beauty parlor, which is a room at her house, until she realizes, um...she doesn\u0027t have to work anymore! \u000A\u000A When they see Costis, some are struck by a pang of guilt, but it doesn\u0027t last long. They promise to give him something, eventually. Meanwhile, he films everything.\u000A\u000A No one wants the celebration to end. They can\u0027t stop grinning. Joy, disbelief, fiesta, hangover. Repeat. Everything is a blur. Someone brings in a big paella, but no one seems to eat, or if they do, it\u0027s a few spoonfuls of rice, a shrimp. More than half of it sits untouched. No one can sleep that first night, or the next...or the one after that. For three nights the lights burn. They don\u0027t want to be alone, bump into one another in the streets at 5, 6 a.m.\u000A\u000A Did you sleep?\u000A\u000A No. You?\u000A\u000A No.\u000A\u000A This is really happening, right? \u000A\u000A They meet in the bar to watch themselves on television, over and over again, then linger in the square. On New Year\u0027s Eve, they arrange a gala event, set up a tent, roll out a red carpet. Everyone wears their best; the women have their hair done again.\u000A\u000A Is it true? Are they chosen? That\u0027s what everyone keeps saying. The media love this story. Reporters arrive from around the world—Brazil, Japan, Russia. They arrive in rental cars, in magenta and lime green, to tell it again and again to everyone who wishes they lived in Sodeto now: Modest farming village strikes it rich but remains true to its roots. \u0022A Jaguar?\u0022 asks a younger farmer in response to a journalist\u0027s question. \u0022What would I do with a Jaguar? All I need is a new tractor.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A __\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A They are things of beauty, these glowing slips of paper, the Virgin in red and gold robes with a host of saving angels. In this fable, the angels are the number lasered on a ball, the one typed on these slips: 58268.\u000A\u000A Once submitted to the Lottery Commission, the tickets are tallied, and the winnings are wired directly into the appropriate bank account. This takes only two or three weeks. Some families purchased tickets for each member, and so the money is further divvied between members of the household. There\u0027s a million here, 100,000 over there; 2.5 million euros for him, 700,000 for her. Within a month, the village is floating on millions and millions of euros, tax-free, as if Sodeto were suddenly Saudi Arabia, perched on huge oil reserves.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s almost easier not to think about why this has happened, to try to justify it. Just remain bubble-wrapped in the miracle-joy of the moment. Out there, people are on the dole, jumping from buildings, while here in Sodeto the genie has granted the villagers their wish, the Michelangelo hand has reached from the clouds, the deus ex machina has saved the day.\u000A\u000A So that\u0027s one thing: Luck is a genie and Michelangelo hand, a reprieve and an unreality.\u000A\u000A But with the passing of time, as the euphoria settles into contentment—and the contentment becomes tinged by the old human frailties—a strange reversal afflicts the citizens of Sodeto: They claim to possess fewer and fewer winning tickets than they first announced, in those initial hours of unselfconscious celebration. Now each day halves the amount of the day before. I was mistaken, they say. I miscounted. Soon, the subterfuge is such that no one remembers how much anyone really has anymore, which commences the watching and whispering. Where they were once naked and more or less equal before one another—where the feeling of having their number chosen overwhelmed the amount they\u0027d won—they now cover up.\u000A\u000A But if nothing has changed, what is there to hide?\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The journalists keep arriving in their magenta rentals, beaming their lights on the village. What is it they want? What is there to be said? The story of the miracle luck of Sodeto becomes more magical by the day.\u000A\u000A Carmen, of the Housewives\u0027 Association, now describes having dreamed the winning ticket number. Rosa, as the town\u0027s mayor and main spokesperson, tells the same story over and over: of a special village on the Monegros plain, in the kingdom of Aragon, one founded in 1950 by scatterlings, when Francisco Franco inaugurated a plan to up farm production by offering free houses near the fields. The village was built to look like every old village in Spain, but without the prejudice of generations, without yet the sulfurous vapors of grudge and time. While Sodeto may have been recently struggling like the rest of Spain, there\u0027s always been something about this place, its openness and amiability, something remarkable and welcoming and regenerative.\u000A\u000A \u0022The town is making its history,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000A The reporters press: But is it magical?\u000A\u000A \u0022Yes, okay,\u0022 she says, \u0022there must be a little magic here.\u0022\u000A\u000A Then the journalists pulse hungrily through the village streets, beaming their blinding rays on anyone they can find, wanting to know the same thing: How does it feel to be so blessed? And how many tickets did you have? \u000A\u000A When they arrive at Costis, he shrugs and says, Well—none.\u000A\u000A Instantly he becomes the story. The unluckiest man living in the luckiest village on earth. He poses for a picture, the sad-sack loser, and the image gets shot around the world. He doesn\u0027t fight it, nor express regret. (Though when Sandra told him what each ticket was worth that first day—not a thousand but one hundred thousand euros—he blinked at her and said, \u0022Oh shit.\u0022)\u000A\u000A Costis plays the role. The Housewives never came out to the fields to sell him a ticket, he says, and he never bothered to ask. So it goes. Does he like being tagged a loser?\u000A\u000A \u0022I haven\u0027t really thought about it,\u0022 he says, barely working up a shrug.\u000A\u000A \u0022Poor Costis,\u0022 the villagers say. \u0022Life could have given him a little bit.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Paco buys Marisol, his hairdresser wife, a new wedding ring. Marisol goes to New York with her sisters and stands in Times Square, an unimaginable dream, which is when it occurs to her that she\u0027s really won. At home, Paco and Marisol buy a bigger tank \u0022for pig pee and excrement,\u0022 to make fertilizer. \u0022When you have 2,500 pigs and you go from 600- to 800-liter tanks, it saves a lot of time,\u0022 says Paco. \u0022And your quality of life gets a little better.\u0022\u000A\u000A Meanwhile, others buy new cars, Audis and BMWs. Carmen buys a couple of Harley-Davidsons. Someone vacations in Venice, another in Mexico. They return from their trips exhausted. After eating every day of their lives at 1 p.m. at the kitchen table in their house, they\u0027re overwhelmed by the outside world, by all the choices, hundreds and thousands of possible restaurants serving food at all hours. \u0022That was fourteen days of panic,\u0022 they say when they return. \u0022It\u0027s loco out there.\u0022\u000A\u000A Why would anyone want to leave this place called Luck?\u000A\u000A Everyone seems to have their kitchen redone, replacing the old with the modern—appliances, cabinets, and counters—bordering on the garish. One farmer, Pedro Luis, guts his abode across the road and in its place builds—in village terms—a mansion. He installs a window in the kitchen, to look out into his garage. That way he can make dinner while keeping a close eye on his new tractor.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Privately, they differ about the nature of this luck. A few of the older ones—those for whom religion is still more than a vestige—believe that winning El Gordo was divine providence, an act of God. But Sandra, the dispossessed, holds a different opinion. She feels that she\u0027s always \u0022lived under a star,\u0022 despite all of her loss and rejection.\u000A\u000A \u0022I want to believe that the people I love are alive and taking care of me,\u0022 she says. \u0022I felt lucky before the lottery. I live in the best town, I have the best house, I have the best boyfriend. But the Gordo was a pat on the back. The night I won, I stared at the ceiling, sobbing uncontrollably. I choose to believe it was my mother and grandmother, saying, \u0027Good job, Sandra.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A Even having just one ticket, she says, was perfect. \u0022I can\u0027t quit my job. I still have to be careful, but I was able to finish redoing the house and buy a car.\u0022 (Prior to the lottery, Costis had been helping with the house but, true to form, often spent part of his days cultivating some marijuana plants and sunbathing nude by the little pool.)\u000A\u000A It was the feeling of winning that Sandra relished, too—not the money but the lottery itself—the surge of energy that passed into Sodeto on the day of El Gordo, when, under their champagne rainbow, they were utterly unified as the beneficiaries of a small miracle. \u0022For one moment, our little village was chosen by the universe!\u0022 she exclaims. \u0022It still gives me goose bumps.\u0022\u000A\u000A Marisol, the hairdresser, meanwhile believes luck to be a random, undiscerning act. Even within that stroke of fortune, some people were more lucky or less lucky. So luck is stupid and indiscriminate and not a question of worth, or magic, though that\u0027s what people sometimes confuse it with. \u0022It was just a number pulled out of a hopper,\u0022 says Marisol.\u000A\u000A In the village, the good fortune can sometimes be hard to stomach. Take one argumentative farmer who shows up at the bar, orders Baileys on the rocks, then complains that the glass is dirty, that the pour is crappy, not enough ice, that no one knows what they\u0027re doing. He\u0027s in a fight with everyone, always. And he was a big winner.\u000A\u000A So if God\u0027s behind this all—or if the most deserving deserve the most luck—did He really intend for such an asshole to win that much?\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Another tarnishment in the village: This shantytown of desperation has grown up and permanently clings to the perimeter of the gold mountain. Money. Magic. Stuff. The outside world wants what the villagers have. The citizens of Sodeto tear the noticias from the community bulletin board, pinned there by Bang Olufsen, BMW, John Deere. They tear down Jacuzzis and Caribbean cruises. And the next day more appear.\u000A\u000A Luck sets loose the vultures, too. The journalists and salesmen go door-to-door, los buitres circling in search of a carcass, and the once inviting village shuts more of itself off with each passing day. The curtains are drawn, the shutters are closed with suspicion.\u000A\u000A Big hulking Fran, who was at hope\u0027s end when his four tickets gave him 400,000 euros (or so we think), literally runs—from the bar, away down the street—like a Beatle when he sees a stranger coming. Eventually others struggle with playing the part of the humble farming village unchanged by millions. Luck is a facade, and fatigue. Luck is not having to worry, but also working hard to preserve the things that once gave your life meaning, like work and love. The truth is they can\u0027t explain what\u0027s happened here. Luck is disarming and confusing, too. Says José, the farmer, remembering how he drove his tractor from the fields at breakneck speed to learn that Sodeto had won, \u0022That morning I was just José, and then I suddenly became José-with-money. But who is that?\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Winter gives way to spring and summer. Life resumes, but at a hitherto unknown relad pace. One young woman buys her own Audi. Some quit their jobs or reduce their hours at work. The farmers, who went into debt to pay for a new collective irrigation system before the lottery, pay off the debt, and instead of waking in the middle of every night to switch hoses, they\u0027re able to program all their irrigation by computer. They sleep again. Meanwhile, the new tractors and farm implements they\u0027ve bought with their Gordo winnings allow them to finish their work more quickly, so there\u0027s more time to spend at their newly renovated houses.\u000A\u000A And while an enduring cordiality reigns among villagers, the subject of money becomes a closed secret. You can gauge by outward appearance—new purchases, work crews at someone\u0027s home—just what someone might have. But from that first ecstatic day when everyone sang out the number of tickets in their possession, the villagers avoid discussing their money.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s a fair question, though—how many tickets?—for there\u0027s another question on some minds: Why is it that the board members of the Housewives\u0027 Association all won so much more than everyone else?\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Why? It\u0027s what some are asking now.\u000A\u000A Carmen, of the Housewives Association, dreamed the number—58268. A French magazine calls her the \u0022good fairy.\u0022 And while everyone is still thankful to her for picking that number, here\u0027s the problem: The Housewives take any tickets that haven\u0027t been sold by the time of El Gordo and purchase them as a group, with the money they\u0027ve otherwise raised. This year there were allegedly four leftover tickets, and those four have become the subject of an unpleasant double squabble. First, questions have been raised about whether or not, on lottery day, there were actually more leftovers, some wondering aloud how certain people, some with barely enough to buy groceries, ended up so endowed with tickets. Nothing that can be proved, but still, if true, those tickets would have gone back in the pot, to benefit the village.\u000A\u000A Meanwhile, a faction of the Housewives feels that the windfall of 400,000 euros represented by the four leftover tickets should be split between the members of the association, individually, rather than dedicated to civic improvement.\u000A\u000A But the other Housewives ask: Why turn your back on your community? After winning El Gordo, you want to take your share of the last 400,000 euros, which equals 5,900 euros a person? And what good can come to the magical village of Sodeto from another flat-screen television in your renovated home, another car in the driveway?\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Must luck, then, be this manifestation of selfishness and greed, too? When asked if she believes anyone in Sodeto has donated anything to charity, Sandra says, \u0022No, that\u0027s not likely.\u0022 And others intimate that once the cameras leave, people will really start spending their money.\u000A\u000A At the lottery office in Grañén, the owners—Pilar and Fortunato—have their own complicated feelings. \u0022We\u0027re the givers of luck,\u0022 says Pilar, \u0022not necessarily the lucky ones. But it\u0027s magic work, seeing people so happy when they win.\u0022 While the media seized on Sodeto, where the plotline of a downtrodden farming community winning it big was the fodder of fairy tale, there were other individual players in the area who won larger amounts of money, and other towns—like Tardienta—that won as much. (\u0022Everyone is a don there now,\u0022 says Fortunato. \u0022They have their problems.\u0022) But it\u0027s the random stories that the lottery-office owners remember: the man who came in just before closing, looking fairly destitute, and chose a Gordo ticket. Another man, who bought Fortunato lunch one day, was more than recompensed when Fortunato reached reflexively into his ticket purse and unwittingly gave him a Gordo ticket as thanks. Even Pilar\u0027s brother had five winning tickets.\u000A\u000A \u0022I feel angry and jealous,\u0022 says Pilar, \u0022but not insane. Maybe it\u0027s a healthy jealousy. I\u0027m thankful, too, because my brother offered us some money.\u0022\u000A\u000A Fortunato, on the other hand, has a harder time with this sort of acceptance. \u0022We touched that number,\u0022 he says. \u0022I said to myself, \u0027I like this number,\u0027 but then forgot. On the last night, when we went to send back the unpurchased tickets before the lottery, there were two Gordo tickets, and my wife kidded me: \u0027These are the winners.\u0027 But we sent them back. Of course, I\u0027m jealous of my friends who don\u0027t have to work anymore, lounging at the bar. No one really thanked us, from Sodeto and elsewhere. My wife\u0027s brother, with all his money, only gave us 15,000 euros. And I\u0027m still mad at my wife.\u000A\u000A \u0022Why did she give those tickets back?\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Costis, the carefree, is camped at his stone house, out in the fields, working at a bank of computers, his glasses missing one temple, editing footage of all he\u0027s filmed during Sodeto\u0027s wonder year. Of everyone who promised him money the day of the Gordo drawing, only one friend threw an envelope at him with 1,000 euros in it, saying, \u0022Take this before I realize I\u0027ve done something stupid.\u0022\u000A\u000A And Sandra gave him her old car.\u000A\u000A Otherwise—nothing.\u000A\u000A Not that it concerns him, for El Gordo has brought something unexpected into his life. A man from Denmark named Lars, who saw an article in the Danish press that featured a picture of Costis, the unlucky. It provoked a question: What am I doing with my life? Maybe it was Costis\u0027s relatively Zen attitude about money. Maybe it just sounded like an improbable story. But Lars immediately contacted Costis with dreams of making a movie. With their shaved heads, they hit it off. Now they\u0027re editing a film about the village of Luck called Cuando Tocó.\u000A\u000A \u0022Everybody is so sick of telling their stories that they run from the reporters,\u0022 says Costis, \u0022but with me, they feel guilty. They think it\u0027s the least they can do.\u0022\u000A\u000A Meanwhile, he\u0027s not heartbroken at all about his failed relationship with Sandra or the missed opportunity of El Gordo. \u0022Maybe I\u0027m too selfish,\u0022 says Costis, \u0022but I like my life as it is.\u0022 And yes, things are actually going pretty well. He\u0027s recently subdivided the property on which his house sits, sold eight hectares for 60,000 euros, what he bought the property for. Now he owns the house without obligations.\u000A\u000A Luck isn\u0027t winning a lottery, he says. Luck is this freedom. And if put to it, luck is a different sort of guardian angel. He describes a job he once had, four years of diving on shipwrecks to photograph them. Something always goes wrong under leagues of water, in a metal hull, and luck is being here to tell about it.\u000A\u000A \u0022The model of society is that you need money to move forward,\u0022 he says. \u0022You constantly think about the past and this conspiracy of events that\u0027s kept you from getting money, because you think you deserve it. Does that mean luck is getting what you think you deserve? I don\u0027t buy into that. I like the generosity of bartering, what comes when you don\u0027t have money. Luck is getting what you give.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A In the village, it\u0027s the eve of Christmas 2012, and the next Gordo arrives while unemployment numbers have worsened in the country. More evictions, more suicides. At the Teatro Real, in faraway Madrid, the shimmering globes sit poised on the stage for the Christmas Lottery, filled with numbered acorns. The children sing in their strangling falsetto—their song about money, and all the salvation it will surely bring. In Spain, they say the person who wins the lottery once wins the lottery twice, and the villagers of Sodeto have gone on a spending spree, buying more tickets than ever, some having spent thousands of euros on the Gordo this year, for they\u0027re believers now. They search for numbers in their dreams, while 58268 was an instant sellout at Pilar and Fortunato\u0027s lottery office.\u000A\u000A The magenta cars return with freshly pressed journalists from faraway countries, there to see what\u0027s become of the modest, happy farmers of Sodeto, the ones who will never change, the ones writing their own history.\u000A\u000A The shutters close, the doors slap shut.\u000A\u000A Inside, people talk. Luck is God, and luck is dumb. Luck is your mother reaching back for you from the beyond, and luck sometimes makes assholes more powerful. But even as luck provides certain comforts while others still suffer, it doesn\u0027t really change you. It doesn\u0027t make you immortal. Or bring you closer to your angels. At a big celebration party, one guy from town threatened to punch his wife because she called him drunk in front of their son. Another, showing off, got decked by a longtime adversary.\u000A\u000A Marisol does the same amount of hairdressing, and repeats, \u0022You\u0027re not magic because you picked a number.\u0022 Rosa, the mayor, sits in her living room with her dog, Homer, eating cookies off a plate, saying, \u0022We are a young town—without much tragedy—and everything that has happened in this year will become a part of us.\u0022\u000A\u000A Sandra\u0027s shepherd boyfriend shakes his head about the whole thing. \u0022I love sheep,\u0022 he says. \u0022But now, after the Gordo, our whole operation has switched to pigs. Really—I wish the damn thing never happened.\u0022\u000A\u000A So luck is a pig, too.\u000A\u000A Sandra lets out a giggle, squeezes his arm. She says at first she made a list of people to give money to, but realized that she needed it for the mortgage, a new car. \u0022I got greedy,\u0022 she says. But the greediness is for more than just the money. It\u0027s a deeper want, and need, for this affirmation. The greed is for luck itself again, the goose bumps and elation and crying at the ceiling, the dancing in the village square, the children singing only for you.\u000A\u000A At the bar on December 22, the villagers gather to watch the Gordo. And no, they don\u0027t win this time. The chosen number belongs to people in the suburbs of Madrid and to the north, in a town called Aranda de Duero. Soon they\u0027re dancing in the streets on television, beneath tassels of champagne spray.\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m very sad,\u0022 Sandra says, eyes moistening. \u0022This will be the day we go back to being Sodeto again, lucky but a little less than the new lucky ones.\u0022\u000A\u000A Michael Paterniti is a GQ correspondent.",

farmers, a village where everyone knew everyone and nearly all struggled to make ends meet. But then, a few days before Christmas, they won the largest lottery in the history of Spain. The entire town. All of them. (Well, almost all of them.) Instantly, Sodeto became known as the luckiest place on earth. Michael Paterniti visits the town that fortune smiled upon and finds that the people there—now flush—are still uncertain of just how lucky they really are</h2><div class="byline-top-flex" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3"><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0"><div class="col col-sm-15" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0"><div class="component-byline byline" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0"><div class="byline-item" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author"><label class="byline-label" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author.0">By </label><div class="component-contributor" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author.1:$0"><a class="byline-contributor-link" rel="author" href="../contributor/michael-paterniti" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author.1:$0.2">Michael Paterniti</a></div></div><div class="byline-item" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$photographer"><label class="byline-label" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$photographer.0">Photographs by </label><div class="component-contributor" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$photographer.1:$0"><a class="byline-contributor-link" rel="author" href="http://www.gq.com/contributor/geof-kern" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$photographer.1:$0.2">Geof Kern</a></div></div><time class="publish-date" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.1">May 6, 2013 3:00 am</time></div></div><div class="col col-sm-5" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1"><div class="social-share-top" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0"><div class="component-social-share default" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fspanish-lottery-winners-sodeto&amp;t=The%20Luckiest%20Village%20in%20the%20World" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fspanish-lottery-winners-sodeto&amp;t=The%20Luckiest%20Village%20in%20the%20World" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook.0"><span class="icon" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook.0.0"></span><span class="label" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook.0.1">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item twitter" data-href="https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Luckiest%20Village%20in%20the%20World&amp;via=GQMagazine&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fspanish-lottery-winners-sodeto" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Luckiest%20Village%20in%20the%20World&amp;via=GQMagazine&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fspanish-lottery-winners-sodeto" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter.0"><span class="icon" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter.0.0"></span><span class="label" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter.0.1">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.0"> When you come upon the luckiest village in the world, all the curtains are drawn.

Is it that your rays are blinding?</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.1"> You&apos;re painted magenta and your rays are blinding.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3"> The lucky village of Sodeto, in the kingdom of Aragon, is a cluster of sensible houses spackled together off the main road, curtained behind a pine copse. The village, with its 250 inhabitants, climbs a slight incline to the church at its height, the bell tower rising in a solid bulk. Tractors clog the main thoroughfare. The earth that surrounds the village is orange and packed hard, though grass sprouts in the village square. The tranquillity is cloying, a lazy silence.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.5"> Not even the dogs work up much gumption to bark around here.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.6">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.7"> The song that the innocent children sing onstage in faraway Madrid&#x2014;wearing their pleated gray skirts, slacks, and ties with blue stripes, dressed in the garb of Catholic-school students&#x2014;is one that warms a Spanish heart but sounds like the creepy refrain before everyone gets offed in a slasher movie. It&apos;s the plaintive ode of two children singing in disconnected, ethereal voices. Their strangling falsettos vine up around each other, singing not about innocent things like love or country, God or glory. They sing out the numbers, as they have for the past 200 years: <em>&quot;Cincuenta y ocho mil, dos cientos sesenta y ocho.&quot;</em> And then: <em>&quot;Cuatro millones de euros.&quot; </em></p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.8"> During this, Spain&apos;s economic apocalypse, they&apos;re singing about money, and all that it brings.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.9">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.a"> The year is 2011: The real estate and banking bubbles have burst. One out of four is out of work&#x2014;5 million total&#x2014;tumbled into an abyss. People march in the streets, turn hungry and hard, glinting with leaden light. Some leave the country in search of jobs. For each percent increase in unemployment comes a 1 percent increase in suicides.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.b"> In the village of Sodeto, the little school has recently been closed. There are mortgage worries, a bad harvest, and water shortages caused by less and less melted water trickling from the Pyrenees.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Everyone has trickled here, too, scatterlings drawn like filings to the magnet. Unlike other Spanish villages, Sodeto is quite young&#x2014;just sixty years old and full of transplants. Sandra, the ever optimistic one, went from Blanes to London to New York to Athens, where she met a man named Costis, spent three years in an RV crisscrossing the Continent before being called here. The towering man named Fran, who lost everything in Barcelona, has come here to make himself clean with his wife and two young kids, humbling himself for any work. Ana, the Romanian who runs Sodeto&apos;s bar, arrived ten years ago to pick strawberries, but with the crisis, no one comes to the bar anymore. She has enough to eat, but with holes in her socks, not much after that.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Now a man hangs himself in Granada when they come to evict him from his home. Another spreads his arms and leaps, but rather than fly, hurtles to earth. In the village, few go to church anymore, though a group still gathers to clean it once a month, a gesture, a vestige from the past, not to be confused with faith.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.e">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.f"> El Gordo is the name given to the oldest lottery jackpot in the world&#x2014;and the richest. Held every year in Madrid on December 22, the Christmas Lottery culminates with the picking of the El Gordo number, the Fat One, which, for many, has become the true Christmas miracle in Spain. In the year of our Lord, Anno Domini, 2011, the tickets bear a painting of the Virgin Mary in red and gold robes, visited by a hovering choir of angels. Joseph and Mary have traveled miles through the Judaean desert in winter&#x2014;in fear of bears and boars, wearing heavy woolen robes, in the rain and cold&#x2014;and now it&apos;s time for her to give birth. Unto this world will come a baby to absolve us of our sins. It&apos;s a nice story, but the lottery jackpot is 720 million euros. Seventy percent of all Spaniards play to win, spending, on average, seventy euros apiece. People visit clairvoyants and fortune-tellers, plead for the winning number.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.g"> At the appointed hour in faraway Madrid, lottery officials take their seats behind a long table on the stage of the Teatro Real. A gauntlet of media cameras fills the front row. The children appear in blue and gray. Behind them are two dramatic globes&#x2014;one large, one smaller&#x2014;made of golden mesh. Inside the large globe are wooden balls the size of acorns, each lasered with a five-digit number, while the smaller globe contains acorn-balls lasered with money amounts.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.h"> Is it preordained that some of us shall remain lost in the desert, or the orange-clay farmlands of northern Spain? Should the ball spin with our number, what then? Might we be plucked from this oblivion and found again?</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.i"> Luck is a drowning and a rebirth. Is the cosmic flash. The second chance.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.j">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.k"> In Sodeto, the windows are shuttered fast. Morning, and the farmers are in the fields. Others have risen and begun to prepare the Christmas feast. Plucking the duck. Slaughtering sheep. The mayor, Rosa, futzes in the kitchen, her lapdog, Homer, eating scraps. Through the window, her neighbor, Sandra, and her bushel of tangled blond hair, drives off to work, forty-five minutes to Huesca.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.l"> There&apos;s something about this landscape of Aragon: Gliding over its orange plains, through its rocky crags, unloosens memory. Sandra&apos;s drive to work is this rush of remembrance: the beach town of Blanes, where her parents ran a British pub&#x2014;the place she grew up as a green-eyed girl, listening to the tourists speaking English, to Pink Floyd on the stereo&#x2014;and where her mother died when she was 10. She recalls how her difficult father remarried, how he did nothing but tear her down, and how he kicked her out when she was 18. Her grandmother from Sodeto was the only one who cared. But the girl was unsettled and ran, meeting Costis in Greece, falling in love. In love with Costis, that way he carried his lithe body without a care in the world. Buying an RV on eBay, throwing over their office jobs, then traveling for three years without a plan, from Greek islands to Albania. With Costis, to Turkey, Italy, Austria. Realizing that what she loved in him was the thing that would later force them to split as lovers: his lack of concern&#x2014;his absolute passivity&#x2014;about what tomorrow might bring, about anything practical. But it had been there right from the start. He never hid it, didn&apos;t have the energy. He was exactly who he was. Authentically himself.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.m"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a92d4eae529ee176cccc39/master/w_768/luckiest-village-02.jpg" alt="luckiest-village-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fspanish-lottery-winners-sodeto&amp;t=luckiest-village-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fspanish-lottery-winners-sodeto&amp;t=luckiest-village-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fspanish-lottery-winners-sodeto&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a92d4eae529ee176cccc39%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fluckiest-village-02.jpg&amp;description=luckiest-village-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fspanish-lottery-winners-sodeto&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a92d4eae529ee176cccc39%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fluckiest-village-02.jpg&amp;description=luckiest-village-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.n"> __</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.o"> When, on a Christmas visit to Sodeto, Sandra learned her beloved grandmother was dying of cancer, she stayed to care for her in the village of Luck.

The government prints tickets bearing the numbers 0 to 99,999 and distributes them to offices like these across the country. A ticket, or <em>billete</em>, costs 200 euros, but because many can&apos;t afford that, it&apos;s broken into tenths, known as <em>d&#xE9;cimos</em>, costing twenty euros apiece&#x2014;and even these are often then broken into quarter <em>d&#xE9;cimos</em>, for five euros apiece. In the little villages, a civic organization like, say, the Housewives&apos; Association of Sodeto, will buy a reel of tickets and sell the quarter <em>d&#xE9;cimos</em>, or &quot;tickets of participation,&quot; door-to-door to raise money to help the town&#x2014;to sponsor a town event or build a small park. Five euros (plus an extra euro donated to the Housewives) gets you into a game offering a .001 percent chance of winning El Gordo. Anyone who answers the door is likely to buy at least one ticket, out of obligation or guilt. But some buy three, some five, fifteen, more.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.t"> This day Carmen purchases 6,000 euros&apos; worth of the series marked 58268&#x2014;1,200 quarter-<em>d&#xE9;cimo</em> tickets of participation in all&#x2014;then she and several board members of the Association go door to door, shilling. They knock in their sister village of Alberuela, too. In total, the Housewives sell 1,196 tickets, with nearly everyone in Sodeto and neighboring Alberuela buying some.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.u"> The tickets end up taped to the fridge, slipped in a drawer, left near a stack of mail, forgotten. For most, it&apos;s part of the Christmas ritual&#x2014;and a donation&#x2014;but in these bleak times, some murmur a little prayer to the tickets fanned in their hand, asking for one wish to be granted. In this life that has given so little, the residents of Sodeto know better than to expect anything. But that doesn&apos;t stop some from a moment&apos;s entertainment, from wondering: <em>What if the wish came true? </em></p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.v">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.w"> Rosa, the mayor, is in the kitchen, her mutt, Homer, eating the scraps.

El Gordo maybe gets announced three hours in, but it&apos;s only 9:57 a.m., and&#x2014;<em>what&apos;s this?</em>&#x2014;already the announcer is bruiting <em>Ol&#xE9;, ol&#xE9;, ol&#xE9;,</em> as the girl and boy, bespectacled, walk across the stage of the Teatro Real holding the acorns for El Gordo aloft, singing their strangled notes.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.y"> Rosa&apos;s not even watching this but halfway listening on the radio.

Where is that little village? asks the announcer. And Rosa almost answers: On the Monegros plain, in Aragon! Then the number is said aloud&#x2014;58268&#x2014; as she goes for her ticket in a panic...<em>could it be?</em>&#x2014;then calls her friend Carmen, of the Housewives&apos; Association. <em>Pero que?

The village was built to look like every old village in Spain, but without the prejudice of generations, without yet the sulfurous vapors of grudge and time.

And how many tickets did you have? </em></p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.2u"> When they arrive at Costis, he shrugs and says, Well&#x2014;<em>none</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.2v"> Instantly <em>he</em> becomes the story. The unluckiest man living in the luckiest village on earth. He poses for a picture, the sad-sack loser, and the image gets shot around the world. He doesn&apos;t fight it, nor express regret. (Though when Sandra told him what each ticket was worth that first day&#x2014;not a thousand but <em>one hundred</em> thousand euros&#x2014;he blinked at her and said, &quot;Oh shit.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.2w"> Costis plays the role. The Housewives never came out to the fields to sell him a ticket, he says, and he never bothered to ask. So it goes. Does he like being tagged a loser?</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.2x"> &quot;I haven&apos;t really thought about it,&quot; he says, barely working up a shrug.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.2y"> &quot;Poor Costis,&quot; the villagers say. &quot;Life could have given him a little bit.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.2z">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.30"> Paco buys Marisol, his hairdresser wife, a new wedding ring. Marisol goes to New York with her sisters and stands in Times Square, an unimaginable dream, which is when it occurs to her that she&apos;s really won. At home, Paco and Marisol buy a bigger tank &quot;for pig pee and excrement,&quot; to make fertilizer. &quot;When you have 2,500 pigs and you go from 600- to 800-liter tanks, it saves a lot of time,&quot; says Paco. &quot;And your quality of life gets a little better.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.31"> Meanwhile, others buy new cars, Audis and BMWs. Carmen buys a couple of Harley-Davidsons. Someone vacations in Venice, another in Mexico. They return from their trips exhausted. After eating every day of their lives at 1 p.m. at the kitchen table in their house, they&apos;re overwhelmed by the outside world, by all the choices, hundreds and thousands of possible restaurants serving food at all hours. &quot;That was fourteen days of panic,&quot; they say when they return. &quot;It&apos;s <em>loco</em> out there.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.32"> Why would anyone want to leave this place called Luck?</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.33"> Everyone seems to have their kitchen redone, replacing the old with the modern&#x2014;appliances, cabinets, and counters&#x2014;bordering on the garish. One farmer, Pedro Luis, guts his abode across the road and in its place builds&#x2014;in village terms&#x2014;a mansion. He installs a window in the kitchen, to look out into his garage. That way he can make dinner while keeping a close eye on his new tractor.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.34">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.35"> Privately, they differ about the nature of this luck. A few of the older ones&#x2014;those for whom religion is still more than a vestige&#x2014;believe that winning El Gordo was divine providence, an act of God. But Sandra, the dispossessed, holds a different opinion. She feels that she&apos;s always &quot;lived under a star,&quot; despite all of her loss and rejection.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.36"> &quot;I want to believe that the people I love are alive and taking care of me,&quot; she says. &quot;I felt lucky before the lottery. I live in the best town, I have the best house, I have the best boyfriend. But the Gordo was a pat on the back. The night I won, I stared at the ceiling, sobbing uncontrollably. I choose to believe it was my mother and grandmother, saying, &apos;Good job, Sandra.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.37"> Even having just one ticket, she says, was perfect. &quot;I can&apos;t quit my job. I still have to be careful, but I was able to finish redoing the house and buy a car.&quot; (Prior to the lottery, Costis had been helping with the house but, true to form, often spent part of his days cultivating some marijuana plants and sunbathing nude by the little pool.)</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.38"> It was the feeling of winning that Sandra relished, too&#x2014;not the money but the lottery itself&#x2014;the surge of energy that passed into Sodeto on the day of El Gordo, when, under their champagne rainbow, they were utterly unified as the beneficiaries of a small miracle. &quot;For one moment, our little village was chosen by the universe!&quot; she exclaims. &quot;It still gives me goose bumps.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.39"> Marisol, the hairdresser, meanwhile believes luck to be a random, undiscerning act. Even within that stroke of fortune, some people were more lucky or less lucky. So luck is stupid and indiscriminate and not a question of worth, or magic, though that&apos;s what people sometimes confuse it with. &quot;It was just a number pulled out of a hopper,&quot; says Marisol.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3a"> In the village, the good fortune can sometimes be hard to stomach. Take one argumentative farmer who shows up at the bar, orders Baileys on the rocks, then complains that the glass is dirty, that the pour is crappy, not enough ice, that no one knows what they&apos;re doing. He&apos;s in a fight with everyone, always. And he was a big winner.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3b"> So if God&apos;s behind this all&#x2014;or if the most deserving deserve the most luck&#x2014;did He really intend for such an asshole to win that much?</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3c">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3d"> Another tarnishment in the village: This shantytown of desperation has grown up and permanently clings to the perimeter of the gold mountain. Money. Magic. Stuff. The outside world wants what the villagers have. The citizens of Sodeto tear the <em>noticias</em> from the community bulletin board, pinned there by Bang Olufsen, BMW, John Deere. They tear down Jacuzzis and Caribbean cruises. And the next day more appear.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3e"> Luck sets loose the vultures, too. The journalists and salesmen go door-to-door, <em>los buitres</em> circling in search of a carcass, and the once inviting village shuts more of itself off with each passing day. The curtains are drawn, the shutters are closed with suspicion.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3f"> Big hulking Fran, who was at hope&apos;s end when his four tickets gave him 400,000 euros (or so we think), literally runs&#x2014;from the bar, away down the street&#x2014;like a Beatle when he sees a stranger coming. Eventually others struggle with playing the part of the humble farming village unchanged by millions. Luck is a facade, and fatigue. Luck is not having to worry, but also working hard to preserve the things that once gave your life meaning, like work and love. The truth is they can&apos;t explain what&apos;s happened here. Luck is disarming and confusing, too. Says Jos&#xE9;, the farmer, remembering how he drove his tractor from the fields at breakneck speed to learn that Sodeto had won, &quot;That morning I was just Jos&#xE9;, and then I suddenly became Jos&#xE9;-with-money. But who is <em>that?</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3g">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3h"> Winter gives way to spring and summer. Life resumes, but at a hitherto unknown relad pace. One young woman buys her own Audi. Some quit their jobs or reduce their hours at work. The farmers, who went into debt to pay for a new collective irrigation system before the lottery, pay off the debt, and instead of waking in the middle of every night to switch hoses, they&apos;re able to program all their irrigation by computer. They sleep again. Meanwhile, the new tractors and farm implements they&apos;ve bought with their Gordo winnings allow them to finish their work more quickly, so there&apos;s more time to spend at their newly renovated houses.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3i"> And while an enduring cordiality reigns among villagers, the subject of money becomes a closed secret. You can gauge by outward appearance&#x2014;new purchases, work crews at someone&apos;s home&#x2014;just what someone might have. But from that first ecstatic day when everyone sang out the number of tickets in their possession, the villagers avoid discussing their money.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3j"> It&apos;s a fair question, though&#x2014;<em>how many tickets?</em>&#x2014;for there&apos;s another question on some minds: Why is it that the board members of the Housewives&apos; Association all won so much more than everyone else?</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3k">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3l"> <em>Why?</em> It&apos;s what some are asking now.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3m"> Carmen, of the Housewives Association, dreamed the number&#x2014;58268. A French magazine calls her the &quot;good fairy.&quot; And while everyone is still thankful to her for picking that number, here&apos;s the problem: The Housewives take any tickets that haven&apos;t been sold by the time of El Gordo and purchase them as a group, with the money they&apos;ve otherwise raised. This year there were allegedly four leftover tickets, and those four have become the subject of an unpleasant double squabble. First, questions have been raised about whether or not, on lottery day, there were actually <em>more</em> leftovers, some wondering aloud how certain people, some with barely enough to buy groceries, ended up so endowed with tickets. Nothing that can be proved, but still, if true, those tickets would have gone back in the pot, to benefit the village.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3n"> Meanwhile, a faction of the Housewives feels that the windfall of 400,000 euros represented by the four leftover tickets should be split between the members of the association, individually, rather than dedicated to civic improvement.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3o"> But the other Housewives ask: Why turn your back on your community? After winning El Gordo, you want to take your share of the last 400,000 euros, which equals 5,900 euros a person? And what good can come to the magical village of Sodeto from another flat-screen television in your renovated home, another car in the driveway?</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3p">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3q"> Must luck, then, be this manifestation of selfishness and greed, too? When asked if she believes anyone in Sodeto has donated anything to charity, Sandra says, &quot;No, that&apos;s not likely.&quot; And others intimate that once the cameras leave, people will really start spending their money.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3r"> At the lottery office in Gra&#xF1;&#xE9;n, the owners&#x2014;Pilar and Fortunato&#x2014;have their own complicated feelings. &quot;We&apos;re the givers of luck,&quot; says Pilar, &quot;not necessarily the lucky ones. But it&apos;s magic work, seeing people so happy when they win.&quot; While the media seized on Sodeto, where the plotline of a downtrodden farming community winning it big was the fodder of fairy tale, there were other individual players in the area who won larger amounts of money, and other towns&#x2014;like Tardienta&#x2014;that won as much. (&quot;Everyone is a don there now,&quot; says Fortunato. &quot;They have their problems.&quot;) But it&apos;s the random stories that the lottery-office owners remember: the man who came in just before closing, looking fairly destitute, and chose a Gordo ticket. Another man, who bought Fortunato lunch one day, was more than recompensed when Fortunato reached reflexively into his ticket purse and unwittingly gave him a Gordo ticket as thanks. Even Pilar&apos;s brother had five winning tickets.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3s"> &quot;I feel angry and jealous,&quot; says Pilar, &quot;but not insane. Maybe it&apos;s a healthy jealousy. I&apos;m thankful, too, because my brother offered us some money.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3t"> Fortunato, on the other hand, has a harder time with this sort of acceptance. &quot;We touched that number,&quot; he says. &quot;I said to myself, &apos;I like this number,&apos; but then forgot. On the last night, when we went to send back the unpurchased tickets before the lottery, there were two Gordo tickets, and my wife kidded me: &apos;These are the winners.&apos; But we sent them back. Of course, I&apos;m jealous of my friends who don&apos;t have to work anymore, lounging at the bar. No one really thanked us, from Sodeto and elsewhere. My wife&apos;s brother, with all his money, only gave us 15,000 euros. And I&apos;m still mad at my wife.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3u"> &quot;Why did she give those tickets back?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3v">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3w"> Costis, the carefree, is camped at his stone house, out in the fields, working at a bank of computers, his glasses missing one temple, editing footage of all he&apos;s filmed during Sodeto&apos;s wonder year. Of everyone who promised him money the day of the Gordo drawing, only one friend threw an envelope at him with 1,000 euros in it, saying, &quot;Take this before I realize I&apos;ve done something stupid.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3x"> And Sandra gave him her old car.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3y"> Otherwise&#x2014;nothing.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.3z"> Not that it concerns him, for El Gordo has brought something unexpected into his life. A man from Denmark named Lars, who saw an article in the Danish press that featured a picture of Costis, the unlucky. It provoked a question: <em>What am I doing with my life?</em> Maybe it was Costis&apos;s relatively Zen attitude about money. Maybe it just sounded like an improbable story. But Lars immediately contacted Costis with dreams of making a movie. With their shaved heads, they hit it off. Now they&apos;re editing a film about the village of Luck called <em>Cuando Toc&#xF3;.</em></p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.40"> &quot;Everybody is so sick of telling their stories that they run from the reporters,&quot; says Costis, &quot;but with me, they feel guilty. They think it&apos;s the least they can do.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.41"> Meanwhile, he&apos;s not heartbroken at all about his failed relationship with Sandra or the missed opportunity of El Gordo. &quot;Maybe I&apos;m too selfish,&quot; says Costis, &quot;but I like my life as it is.&quot; And yes, things are actually going pretty well. He&apos;s recently subdivided the property on which his house sits, sold eight hectares for 60,000 euros, what he bought the property for. Now he owns the house without obligations.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.42"> Luck isn&apos;t winning a lottery, he says. Luck is this freedom. And if put to it, luck is a different sort of guardian angel. He describes a job he once had, four years of diving on shipwrecks to photograph them. Something always goes wrong under leagues of water, in a metal hull, and luck is being here to tell about it.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.43"> &quot;The model of society is that you need money to move forward,&quot; he says. &quot;You constantly think about the past and this conspiracy of events that&apos;s kept you from getting money, because you think you deserve it. Does that mean luck is getting what you think you deserve? I don&apos;t buy into that. I like the generosity of bartering, what comes when you don&apos;t have money. Luck is getting what you give.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.44">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.45"> In the village, it&apos;s the eve of Christmas 2012, and the next Gordo arrives while unemployment numbers have worsened in the country. More evictions, more suicides. At the Teatro Real, in faraway Madrid, the shimmering globes sit poised on the stage for the Christmas Lottery, filled with numbered acorns. The children sing in their strangling falsetto&#x2014;their song about money, and all the salvation it will surely bring. In Spain, they say the person who wins the lottery once wins the lottery twice, and the villagers of Sodeto have gone on a spending spree, buying more tickets than ever, some having spent thousands of euros on the Gordo this year, for they&apos;re believers now. They search for numbers in their dreams, while 58268 was an instant sellout at Pilar and Fortunato&apos;s lottery office.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.46"> The magenta cars return with freshly pressed journalists from faraway countries, there to see what&apos;s become of the modest, happy farmers of Sodeto, the ones who will never change, the ones writing their own history.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.47"> The shutters close, the doors slap shut.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.48"> Inside, people talk. Luck is God, and luck is dumb. Luck is your mother reaching back for you from the beyond, and luck sometimes makes assholes more powerful. But even as luck provides certain comforts while others still suffer, it doesn&apos;t really change you. It doesn&apos;t make you immortal. Or bring you closer to your angels. At a big celebration party, one guy from town threatened to punch his wife because she called him drunk in front of their son. Another, showing off, got decked by a longtime adversary.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.49"> Marisol does the same amount of hairdressing, and repeats, &quot;You&apos;re not magic because you picked a number.&quot; Rosa, the mayor, sits in her living room with her dog, Homer, eating cookies off a plate, saying, &quot;We are a young town&#x2014;without much tragedy&#x2014;and everything that has happened in this year will become a part of us.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.4a"> Sandra&apos;s shepherd boyfriend shakes his head about the whole thing. &quot;I love sheep,&quot; he says. &quot;But now, after the Gordo, our whole operation has switched to pigs. Really&#x2014;I wish the damn thing never happened.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.4b"> So luck is a pig, too.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.4c"> Sandra lets out a giggle, squeezes his arm. She says at first she made a list of people to give money to, but realized that she needed it for the mortgage, a new car. &quot;I got greedy,&quot; she says. But the greediness is for more than just the money. It&apos;s a deeper want, and need, for this affirmation. The greed is for luck itself again, the goose bumps and elation and crying at the ceiling, the dancing in the village square, the children singing only for you.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.4d"> At the bar on December 22, the villagers gather to watch the Gordo. And no, they don&apos;t win this time. The chosen number belongs to people in the suburbs of Madrid and to the north, in a town called Aranda de Duero. Soon they&apos;re dancing in the streets on television, beneath tassels of champagne spray.</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.4e"> &quot;I&apos;m very sad,&quot; Sandra says, eyes moistening. &quot;This will be the day we go back to being Sodeto again, lucky but a little less than the new lucky ones.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1t3j49ls4qo.1.1.0.0.4.4f"> <em>Michael Paterniti is a
