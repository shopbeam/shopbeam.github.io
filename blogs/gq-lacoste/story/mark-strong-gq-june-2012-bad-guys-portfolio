Arguably everyone has seen the British actor at least once: As Harry Stark on the British television series The Long Firm, or playing Frank D\u0027Amico in Kick-Ass, Lord Blackwood in Sherlock Holmes, Clive Cornell in The Guard, Archy in Rocknrolla; in the past year alone he has been in Green Lantern, John Carter,and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. The man works. And yet, chances are also good you don\u0027t know his name. Despite leading man looks—or perhaps because of them—Strong has carved out a unique niche for himself, marrying sophistication with brute violence. The forty-eight-year-old actor\u0027s villains are world-weary, bespoke bastards who will split your skull just as casually as they will pour another scotch. Strong maps out his typography of terror.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: Was there a particular villain who scared you as a child?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: The child catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. He wore a top hat, dressed all in black, and he used to capture children by trapping them in nets. Maybe I was too young when I saw it, but he terrified me.\u000A\u000A GQ: Do you have a favorite fictional villain?**\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: Shakespeare\u0027s Richard III would be my alpha-villain. I\u0027ve been in that play more than once, and I\u0027ve heard every line of it many times. What I enjoy most is how much fun Richard has with the audience, how he plays with it. For example, when he\u0027s wooing Lady Anne over the body of her dead father, who he\u0027s killed in a previous scene, he turns to the audience and says, \u0022Watch this. Watch. Watch. Watch what I\u0027m going to do.\u0022 He\u0027s soon wooed Anne and she\u0027s agreed to meet him. He says, \u0022Was ever woman in this humor wooed? Was ever woman in this humor won?\u0022 I think that\u0027s a pretty extraordinary piece of villainy, to woo a woman over the body of the father he killed—and to have so much fun doing it! **\u000A\u000AGQ: Is there an actor\u0027s performance that embodies evil for you?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: Ralph Fiennes in Schindler\u0027s List. There was something about the character\u0027s banal, low-key villainy that made him really scary. I would say the same of Tony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.\u000A\u000AGQ: What scares you most now?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: I\u0027m probably scared, without getting too pretentious about it, by concepts: People who don\u0027t behave properly towards other people, dictators who murder their citizens, things like that. I think politics is very scary.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you ever tap into your own fears when playing a part?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: To some extent you have to remember things that terrified you in the past to play fear effectively. I can\u0027t say that I\u0027ve been around a lot of real-life villains, but I try to remember how it feels when you\u0027re terrified yourself.\u000A\u000AGQ: Has there ever been a villain you admired?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: I would have to say Richard III again, just because, in a dramatic context that isn\u0027t real, he manages to conduct his villainy with such good humor and take the audience along with him on the ride. In fiction, that\u0027s admirable. Not in real life.\u000A\u000AGQ: When did you first know that you could personify evil?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: I\u0027ve always known that I could play a villain. I feel like I could play lots of different things. That\u0027s the job of an actor. But playing Harry Starks in The Long Firm probably spawned a lot of the dark characters that I\u0027ve played since then because it was so successful.\u000A\u000AGQ: Was there a costume that helped you shape a character?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: When I played Lord Blackwood in Sherlock Holmes, we invented a very severe Prussian haircut that didn\u0027t exist yet. It was shaved around the sides with a severe widow\u0027s peak. We coupled that with a huge astrakhan, or black Persian lamb-fur collar, attached to a Victorian front coat made of leather. With that whole S&amp;M look, it wasn\u0027t hard to play an imposing guy meant to be in league with Satan.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you prepare differently to play a villain?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: The preparation is the same whether you\u0027re playing the bad guy or the good guy. You have to find what makes that character tick and make them believable. With villains, it usually helps to find something that\u0027s happened in their past that would explain why they are the way they are. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve enjoyed—if you can use that word—about playing evil characters: figuring out what makes them do bad things. I don\u0027t believe the world is black-and-white, everybody\u0027s both good and evil.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you think villains see themselves as bad guys?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: Villains never see themselves as bad, in my opinion. Perhaps the more melodramatic villains revel in the notion that they are perceived as bad and that gives them their power.\u000A\u000AGQ: What do villains have in common with heroes?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: A singleness of purpose. It\u0027s being driven to do the thing that they think is right.\u000A\u000AGQ: What\u0027s the most villainous line you\u0027ve ever uttered?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: It\u0027s probably unrepeatable, to be honest. In Kick-Ass, Frank D\u0027Amico had some very choice lines.\u000A\u000AGQ: Is it ever been hard for you to shake off a villainous character?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: No, because they\u0027re so out there. Funnily enough, when I auditioned for my Harry Starks, they worried I was too nice to go that dark.\u000A\u000AGQ: How evil are you, percentage-wise, in real life?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: Zero. I\u0027ve got a few points on my license for speeding. That\u0027s only ever happened once.\u000A\u000AGQ: How has onscreen villainy changed?\u000A\u000A Mark Strong: In the old days you couldn\u0027t get away with it, thanks to William Hayes, the head of censorship in America in the thirties. One of the tenets that he introduced in filmmaking was that the baddy was never allowed to get away with it. That\u0027s very different today. People say things are bad when they mean good. They describe things as sick when they mean good. There are video games which are unbelievably violent and all about people doing things you wouldn\u0027t dream of doing in real life—and they\u0027re celebrated. I think it\u0027s because we all understand it\u0027s a different world. It\u0027s another place. Villainy has now been accepted as a necessary part of the drama. If you have a hero, you need a villain. The subtle shift is that now, we\u0027re allowed to enjoy the villain.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined",

dapper, stone-cold gangster, you can&#x2019;t do better than Mark Strong. Arguably everyone has seen the British actor at least once: As Harry Stark on the British television series <em>The Long Firm</em>, or playing Frank D&#x2019;Amico in <em>Kick-Ass, </em>Lord Blackwood in <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>, Clive Cornell in <em>The Guard</em>, Archy in <em>Rocknrolla; </em>in the past year alone he has been in Green<em> Lantern</em>, <em>John Carter</em>,and <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>. The man works. And yet, chances are also good you don&#x2019;t know his name. Despite leading man looks&#x2014;or perhaps because of them&#x2014;Strong has carved out a unique niche for himself, marrying sophistication with brute violence. The forty-eight-year-old actor&#x2019;s villains are world-weary, bespoke bastards who will split your skull just as casually as they will pour another scotch. Strong maps out his typography of terror.</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.2"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/43201337" height="360" width="628"></iframe></div></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.3"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>GQ: Was there a particular villain who scared you as a child?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>The child catcher from <em>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</em>. He wore a top hat, dressed all in black, and he used to capture children by trapping them in nets. Maybe I was too young when I saw it, but he terrified me.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>GQ: Do you have a favorite fictional villain?</strong>**</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.8"> Mark Strong: <strong>Shakespeare&#x2019;s Richard III would be my alpha-villain. I&#x2019;ve been in that play more than once, and I&#x2019;ve heard every line of it many times. What I enjoy most is how much fun Richard has with the audience, how he plays with it. For example, when he&#x2019;s wooing Lady Anne over the body of her dead father, who he&#x2019;s killed in a previous scene, he turns to the audience and says, &quot;Watch this. Watch. Watch. Watch what I&#x2019;m going to do.&quot; He&#x2019;s soon wooed Anne and she&#x2019;s agreed to meet him. He says, &quot;Was ever woman in this humor wooed? Was ever woman in this humor won?&quot; I think that&#x2019;s a pretty extraordinary piece of villainy, to woo a woman over the body of the father he killed&#x2014;and to have so much fun doing it! </strong>**</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>GQ: Is there an actor&#x2019;s performance that embodies evil for you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>Ralph Fiennes in <em>Schindler&#x2019;s List</em>. There was something about the character&#x2019;s banal, low-key villainy that made him really scary. I would say the same of Tony Hopkins in <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>GQ: What scares you most now?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>I&#x2019;m probably scared, without getting too pretentious about it, by concepts: People who don&#x2019;t behave properly towards other people, dictators who murder their citizens, things like that. I think politics is very scary.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>GQ: Do you ever tap into your own fears when playing a part?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>To some extent you have to remember things that terrified you in the past to play fear effectively. I can&#x2019;t say that I&#x2019;ve been around a lot of real-life villains, but I try to remember how it feels when you&#x2019;re terrified yourself.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>GQ: Has there ever been a villain you admired?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>I would have to say Richard III again, just because, in a dramatic context that isn&#x2019;t real, he manages to conduct his villainy with such good humor and take the audience along with him on the ride. In fiction, that&#x2019;s admirable. Not in real life.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>GQ: When did you first know that you could personify evil?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>I&#x2019;ve always known that I could play a villain. I feel like I could play lots of different things. That&#x2019;s the job of an actor. But playing Harry Starks in <em>The Long Firm</em> probably spawned a lot of the dark characters that I&#x2019;ve played since then because it was so successful.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>GQ: Was there a costume that helped you shape a character?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>When I played Lord Blackwood in <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>, we invented a very severe Prussian haircut that didn&#x2019;t exist yet. It was shaved around the sides with a severe widow&#x2019;s peak. We coupled that with a huge astrakhan, or black Persian lamb-fur collar, attached to a Victorian front coat made of leather. With that whole S&amp;M look, it wasn&#x2019;t hard to play an imposing guy meant to be in league with Satan.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>GQ: Do you prepare differently to play a villain?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>The preparation is the same whether you&#x2019;re playing the bad guy or the good guy. You have to find what makes that character tick and make them believable. With villains, it usually helps to find something that&#x2019;s happened in their past that would explain why they are the way they are. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ve enjoyed&#x2014;if you can use that word&#x2014;about playing evil characters: figuring out what makes them do bad things. I don&#x2019;t believe the world is black-and-white, everybody&#x2019;s both good and evil.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>GQ: Do you think villains see themselves as bad guys?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>Villains never see themselves as bad, in my opinion. Perhaps the more melodramatic villains revel in the notion that they are perceived as bad and that gives them their power.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>GQ: What do villains have in common with heroes?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>A singleness of purpose. It&#x2019;s being driven to do the thing that they think is right.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>GQ: What&#x2019;s the most villainous line you&#x2019;ve ever uttered?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>It&#x2019;s probably unrepeatable, to be honest. In <em>Kick-Ass</em>, Frank D&#x2019;Amico had some very choice lines.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>GQ: Is it ever been hard for you to shake off a villainous character?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>No, because they&#x2019;re so out there. Funnily enough, when I auditioned for my Harry Starks, they worried I was too nice to go that dark.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>GQ: How evil are you, percentage-wise, in real life?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>Zero. I&#x2019;ve got a few points on my license for speeding. That&#x2019;s only ever happened once.</p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>GQ: How has onscreen villainy changed?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.y"><strong> Mark Strong: </strong>In the old days you couldn&#x2019;t get away with it, thanks to William Hayes, the head of censorship in America in the thirties. One of the tenets that he introduced in filmmaking was that the baddy was never allowed to get away with it. That&#x2019;s very different today. People say things are bad when they mean good. They describe things as sick when they mean good. There are video games which are unbelievably violent and all about people doing things you wouldn&#x2019;t dream of doing in real life&#x2014;and they&#x2019;re celebrated. I think it&#x2019;s because we all understand it&#x2019;s a different world. It&#x2019;s another place. Villainy has now been accepted as a necessary part of the drama. If you have a hero, you need a villain. The subtle shift is that now, we&#x2019;re allowed to enjoy the villain.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1bol3zebpj4.1.1.0.0.4.z"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div
