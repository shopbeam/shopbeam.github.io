If Glenn O\u0027Brien and Tyler, the Creator—two people whose aesthetics couldn\u0027t be more different—can wear Supreme in their own way, so can you.\u000A\u000A See the Video   |   Hear the Podcast\u000A\u000A GQ: How did you guys first become aware of Supreme?\u000A\u000A Glenn O\u0027Brien: Supreme is in my neighborhood in New York, so I\u0027d walk by it all the time. I\u0027d see 150 guys standing in line and figured out that\u0027s when they\u0027d have some kind of new sneaker or something in there. I didn\u0027t want to be the old guy walking into Supreme, but then I was walking by one day and they were showing Glenn O\u0027Brien\u0027s TV Party from the \u002780s on this big bank of TVs and I thought, Jeez, I guess I can go in there now. So I started going in there and buying shit, and I got to be friends with some of the guys who worked there, I got to know [founder] James Jebbia and the guys in the store.\u000A\u000A Tyler, the Creator: We would always skate around the area it\u0027s at [in L.A.]. That was the only store in the area at the time that sold skateboards, so we\u0027d go in there and buy boards, and I just gradually became friends with the guys who were working there. They would always just look out for us, me and my friends, when we were over there and out and about. They were like our big brothers over there and shit, they were older than us. I\u0027m still cool with them to this day—I was over there yesterday. And over the last year, as I got bigger perhaps or whatever, I would always rap about it, and the guys at the L.A. store would always put a good word in for me with the dudes, the head guys, in New York. I eventually met Jebbia and Angelo [Baque] and all those guys, and we\u0027ve been cool since. They respect me for doing what I do, and I respect them, cause that\u0027s my favorite shit. It\u0027s just cool I can be a part of this family and shit. They show me love, I show them love, they\u0027re awesome, and I\u0027ve always looked up to them.\u000A\u000A GQ: One of the interesting things about Supreme is that they\u0027re not gross about branding and marketing—they rely on quality product, word of mouth and a strong visual aesthetic.\u000A\u000A Tyler: Visual aesthetic is important to me. I take video directing and designing album art and shit like that very serious, and they do, too. So that\u0027s one thing I like from them, the way they design certain things—not too much, not too little.\u000A\u000A Glenn: It\u0027s sort of a non-strategy strategy. I think it just comes out having integrity. I don\u0027t think we should be Communists or anything, but they do business in a kind of honorable way that I really respect. And that\u0027s really rare, especially in the clothes business.\u000A\u000A Tyler: That\u0027s why I like them, because they don\u0027t fuck with anybody. And I don\u0027t really fuck with anybody. I keep my circle close and they do too, they don\u0027t associate themselves with other brands that they don\u0027t respect or actually like.\u000A\u000A GQ: It\u0027s not a brand that bends over backwards to woo you. \u000A\u000A Glenn: Which is good, because I\u0027m unwooable.\u000A\u000A GQ: What do you think about Supreme\u0027s emphasis on short runs? It seems smart, not just because demand outweighs supply, but because they can take the time to do a few things really well. \u000A\u000A Glenn: That\u0027s one of the cool things about James. He started making skateboard decks with artists and selling them for $65. And then people would turn around and sell them for $600. But did he raise the price to $600? No, he kept it where it was, because he\u0027s serving his customers and that\u0027s what those guys do. They have the right idea about a business. I hope I conduct my business in the same kind of way.\u000A\u000A Tyler: The fact that the runs are so short means that two people feel special when they get certain stuff. Instead of 500, they\u0027ll make 200, and then people feel more special knowing that only 199 other people have it.\u000A\u000A GQ: Glenn, you wrote the intro to the book Supreme did with Rizzoli and are one of the few people to have interviewed James Jebbia, who\u0027s known for being kind of press-shy. How did that come about? \u000A\u000A Glenn: We\u0027re friends, and I figured James would do it with me because he knew that I knew where he was coming from and trusted that it would be done right. For [the Rizzoli book], he just called me up and asked me if I would do it and I said of course. When I\u0027m writing about something I like, it\u0027s a pleasure.\u000A\u000A GQ: What Supreme does transcends skate culture and taps into art, music, film, even politics. \u000A\u000A Glenn: I don\u0027t pay any attention to skateboard fashion or anything like that, but they work with artists who I respect and a lot of my friends have done stuff with them, and I think that\u0027s great. They have interests that I can relate to.\u000A\u000A Tyler: Same here. Like with music, again, what you said—they\u0027re in different worlds and shit. Like skateboarding, that\u0027s high value to Supreme, and then music and art, and they\u0027re in the fashion world too. So, I don\u0027t know. They\u0027re pretty versatile.\u000A\u000A Glenn: They were friends with Malcolm McLaren—\u000A\u000A Tyler: I was gonna bring that shit today too!\u000A\u000A Glenn: —and Malcolm\u0027s somebody who also did clothes, but he did them in a way that was completely individualistic and a little bit political and out-there.\u000A\u000A GQ: I wondered whether the geography of the downtown New York shop made Supreme more inclined to engage with the art world. Even the logo looks like a play on Barbara Kruger\u0027s work. \u000A\u000A Glenn: It\u0027s not, actually. Well, I don\u0027t know if you could say it\u0027s a coincidence, but it\u0027s a really common typeface, and red and white really stands out. I think the only importance of the store in SoHo geographically is that Lafayette is a big wide street that doesn\u0027t have much traffic on it, so kids can skateboard in front of the store.\u000A\u000A GQ: What are some of your favorite artist collaborations Supreme has done?\u000A\u000A Glenn: There are so many. Christopher Wool. I like the Richard Prince bunny skull, I like the Larry Clark board. They\u0027re all equally good to me. Peter Saville, the great art director who worked with Joy Division. I was really close with this guy Shawn Mortensen, an L.A. photographer, and he put me in a Supreme lookbook. He went to live with the Zapatistas, the revolutionaries in Mexico, and they did all these shirts with pictures of the Zapatistas on it. That was great.\u000A\u000A Tyler: There\u0027s a lot of artists I didn\u0027t know about that I learned about from them. My favorite collaboration they did was with Sean Cliver. He has decks with black dudes in KKK suits, a white kid with a Hitler mustache dressed as a pimp, stuff with John Wayne Gacy—just cool decks. I like his art a lot, and I didn\u0027t know about him until I seen that shit. That was back in \u002707, I believe.\u000A\u000A GQ: There are forums on Odd Future fan pages dedicated to what Supreme gear you\u0027re wearing. How do you feel about that? \u000A\u000A Tyler: Yeah, that\u0027s fucking weird. I try to tell all the—not even the kids, even people older than me—to just be themselves. Don\u0027t wear what I wear \u0027cause I wear it; wear what you like. It\u0027s weird when there\u0027s another 20-year-old in an outfit I wore last week. I hate that shit! Wear what you want to wear. Don\u0027t be a copy of me.\u000A\u000A GQ: Do you consider yourself a fashion dude? \u000A\u000A Tyler: I\u0027m not into fashion, but I like design. I wear the same shoes every day. These same pants. I\u0027ve been wearing this Supreme hat for a month. The only thing that changes everyday is my shirt and my jacket. I just wear regular T-shirts, truthfully, but I do like button-ups or crazy prints and designs—colorful shirts and shit. It\u0027s either that or a regular white shirt. I\u0027m not into fashion like that; I\u0027ll throw on a shirt and be a fucking man, you know? I have this one button-up with a bunch of flags and metal on it, and I really like that shirt because I like the way that shit looks, but some people might take it like, Oh he\u0027s into fashion. But I just like the shirt. All the little metals look cool. And I like tie-dye.\u000A\u000A GQ: You did a lookbook spread for Supreme. I can\u0027t imagine you\u0027d be doing that for just any brand. \u000A\u000A Tyler: Aw, hell no. People have asked, but it\u0027s like why would I do that when I don\u0027t even wear your shit and hate your brand? That was on one of my goal lists, to be in a lookbook for Supreme, so that was as close as I got. I was really fuckin\u0027 happy. It was so tight. Aaron [Bondaroff] put that together. Hi Aaron!\u000A\u000A GQ: What is Supreme doing that no one else is getting right? \u000A\u000A Tyler: Nothing. That\u0027s what it is, that\u0027s why I like them. If that nothing makes any fucking sense. Everybody else is trying something, and they\u0027re just doing it. I have to fart.\u000A\u000A[Later on, GQ caught up with Glenn to ask a few more questions...]\u000A\u000A GQ: Glenn, how do you wear Supreme as an adult male, versus how Tyler and his friends might wear it? \u000A\u000A Glenn: Well, I tuck my shirt in.\u000A\u000A GQ: How can dudes incorporate Supreme stuff into a look that\u0027s more polished? \u000A\u000A Glenn: You just wear the right size. I\u0027ve been buying their chinos for years, I think they\u0027re just the best; they also have very nice jeans. And I think those things mix perfectly—you could wear them with a tweed sportcoat or a blazer. I don\u0027t like to dress head-to-toe in any designer or brand, but a lot of this stuff integrates really well into a wardrobe. The T-shirts are really well made, and they have a stretchy panel down the side so that they actually fit right. A lot of thought goes into these clothes.\u000A\u000A GQ: What\u0027s your impression of Tyler\u0027s music? \u000A\u000A Glenn: To me, it\u0027s almost like stand-up comedy with a beat.\u000A\u000A GQ: And you\u0027ve seen Odd Future\u0027s videos? \u000A\u000A Glenn: Yeah.\u000A\u000A GQ: What did you think? \u000A\u000A Glenn: I don\u0027t think he really ate that big bug.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Tyler, the Creator, \u0022Yonkers\u0022\u000A\u000A See the Video   |   Hear the Podcast",

If Glenn O&#x2019;Brien and Tyler, the Creator&#x2014;two people whose aesthetics couldn&#x2019;t be more different&#x2014;can wear Supreme in their own way, so can you.</em></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.2"> <a href="http://www.gq.com/video/videos/glenn-obrien-tyler-the-creator-supreme">See the Video</a>   |   <a href="http://www.gq.com/style/style-guy/201203/glenn-obrien-michael-hainey-podcast-march">Hear the Podcast</a></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.3"> GQ: <strong>How did you guys first become aware of Supreme?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.5"> Glenn O&#x2019;Brien: Supreme is in my neighborhood in New York, so I&#x2019;d walk by it all the time. I&#x2019;d see 150 guys standing in line and figured out that&#x2019;s when they&#x2019;d have some kind of new sneaker or something in there. I didn&#x2019;t want to be the old guy walking into Supreme, but then I was walking by one day and they were showing <em>Glenn O&#x2019;Brien&#x2019;s TV Party </em>from the &#x2019;80s on this big bank of TVs and I thought, <em>Jeez, I guess I can go in there now.</em> So I started going in there and buying shit, and I got to be friends with some of the guys who worked there, I got to know [founder] James Jebbia and the guys in the store.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.6"> Tyler, the Creator: We would always skate around the area it&#x2019;s at [in L.A.]. That was the only store in the area at the time that sold skateboards, so we&#x2019;d go in there and buy boards, and I just gradually became friends with the guys who were working there. They would always just look out for us, me and my friends, when we were over there and out and about. They were like our big brothers over there and shit, they were older than us. I&#x2019;m still cool with them to this day&#x2014;I was over there yesterday. And over the last year, as I got bigger perhaps or whatever, I would always rap about it, and the guys at the L.A. store would always put a good word in for me with the dudes, the head guys, in New York. I eventually met Jebbia and Angelo [Baque] and all those guys, and we&#x2019;ve been cool since. They respect me for doing what I do, and I respect them, cause that&#x2019;s my favorite shit. It&#x2019;s just cool I can be a part of this family and shit. They show me love, I show them love, they&#x2019;re awesome, and I&#x2019;ve always looked up to them.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.7"> GQ: <strong>One of the interesting things about Supreme is that they&#x2019;re not gross about branding and marketing&#x2014;they rely on quality product, word of mouth and a strong visual aesthetic.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.8"> Tyler: Visual aesthetic is important to me. I take video directing and designing album art and shit like that very serious, and they do, too. So that&#x2019;s one thing I like from them, the way they design certain things&#x2014;not too much, not too little.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.9"> Glenn: It&#x2019;s sort of a non-strategy strategy. I think it just comes out having integrity. I don&#x2019;t think we should be Communists or anything, but they do business in a kind of honorable way that I really respect. And that&#x2019;s really rare, especially in the clothes business.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.a"> Tyler: That&#x2019;s why I like them, because they don&#x2019;t fuck with anybody. And I don&#x2019;t really fuck with anybody. I keep my circle close and they do too, they don&#x2019;t associate themselves with other brands that they don&#x2019;t respect or actually like.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.b"> GQ:<strong> It&#x2019;s not a brand that bends over backwards to woo you. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Glenn: Which is good, because I&#x2019;m unwooable.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.d"> GQ: <strong>What do you think about Supreme&#x2019;s emphasis on short runs? It seems smart, not just because demand outweighs supply, but because they can take the time to do a few things really well. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.e"> Glenn: That&#x2019;s one of the cool things about James. He started making skateboard decks with artists and selling them for $65. And then people would turn around and sell them for $600. But did he raise the price to $600? No, he kept it where it was, because he&#x2019;s serving his customers and that&#x2019;s what those guys do. They have the right idea about a business. I hope I conduct my business in the same kind of way.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.f"> Tyler: The fact that the runs are so short means that two people feel special when they get certain stuff. Instead of 500, they&#x2019;ll make 200, and then people feel more special knowing that only 199 other people have it.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.g"> GQ: <strong>Glenn, you wrote the intro to the book Supreme did with Rizzoli and are one of the few people to have interviewed James Jebbia, who&#x2019;s known for being kind of press-shy. How did that come about? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.h"> Glenn: We&#x2019;re friends, and I figured James would do it with me because he knew that I knew where he was coming from and trusted that it would be done right. For [the Rizzoli book], he just called me up and asked me if I would do it and I said of course. When I&#x2019;m writing about something I like, it&#x2019;s a pleasure.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.i"> GQ: <strong>What Supreme does transcends skate culture and taps into art, music, film, even politics. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.j"> Glenn: I don&#x2019;t pay any attention to skateboard fashion or anything like that, but they work with artists who I respect and a lot of my friends have done stuff with them, and I think that&#x2019;s great. They have interests that I can relate to.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.k"> Tyler: Same here. Like with music, again, what you said&#x2014;they&#x2019;re in different worlds and shit. Like skateboarding, that&#x2019;s high value to Supreme, and then music and art, and they&#x2019;re in the fashion world too. So, I don&#x2019;t know. They&#x2019;re pretty versatile.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.l"> Glenn: They were friends with Malcolm McLaren&#x2014;</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.m"> Tyler: I was gonna bring that shit today too!</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.n"> Glenn: &#x2014;and Malcolm&#x2019;s somebody who also did clothes, but he did them in a way that was completely individualistic and a little bit political and out-there.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.o"> GQ: <strong>I wondered whether the geography of the downtown New York shop made Supreme more inclined to engage with the art world. Even the logo looks like a play on Barbara Kruger&#x2019;s work. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.p"> Glenn: It&#x2019;s not, actually. Well, I don&#x2019;t know if you could say it&#x2019;s a coincidence, but it&#x2019;s a really common typeface, and red and white really stands out. I think the only importance of the store in SoHo geographically is that Lafayette is a big wide street that doesn&#x2019;t have much traffic on it, so kids can skateboard in front of the store.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.q"> GQ: <strong>What are some of your favorite artist collaborations Supreme has done?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.r"> Glenn: There are so many. Christopher Wool. I like the Richard Prince bunny skull, I like the Larry Clark board. They&#x2019;re all equally good to me. Peter Saville, the great art director who worked with Joy Division. I was really close with this guy Shawn Mortensen, an L.A. photographer, and he put me in a Supreme lookbook. He went to live with the Zapatistas, the revolutionaries in Mexico, and they did all these shirts with pictures of the Zapatistas on it. That was great.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.s"> Tyler: There&#x2019;s a lot of artists I didn&#x2019;t know about that I learned about from them. My favorite collaboration they did was with Sean Cliver. He has decks with black dudes in KKK suits, a white kid with a Hitler mustache dressed as a pimp, stuff with John Wayne Gacy&#x2014;just cool decks. I like his art a lot, and I didn&#x2019;t know about him until I seen that shit. That was back in &#x2019;07, I believe.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.t"> GQ: <strong>There are forums on Odd Future fan pages dedicated to what Supreme gear you&#x2019;re wearing. How do you feel about that? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.u"> Tyler: Yeah, that&#x2019;s fucking weird. I try to tell all the&#x2014;not even the kids, even people older than me&#x2014;to just be themselves. Don&#x2019;t wear what I wear &#x2019;cause I wear it; wear what you like. It&#x2019;s weird when there&#x2019;s another 20-year-old in an outfit I wore last week. I hate that shit! Wear what you want to wear. Don&#x2019;t be a copy of me.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.v"> GQ:<strong> Do you consider yourself a fashion dude? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.w"> Tyler: I&#x2019;m not into fashion, but I like design. I wear the same shoes every day. These same pants. I&#x2019;ve been wearing this Supreme hat for a month. The only thing that changes everyday is my shirt and my jacket. I just wear regular T-shirts, truthfully, but I do like button-ups or crazy prints and designs&#x2014;colorful shirts and shit. It&#x2019;s either that or a regular white shirt. I&#x2019;m not into fashion like that; I&#x2019;ll throw on a shirt and be a fucking man, you know? I have this one button-up with a bunch of flags and metal on it, and I really like that shirt because I like the way that shit looks, but some people might take it like, <em>Oh he&#x2019;s into fashion</em>. But I just like the shirt. All the little metals look cool. And I like tie-dye.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.x"> GQ: <strong>You did a lookbook spread for Supreme. I can&#x2019;t imagine you&#x2019;d be doing that for just any brand. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.y"> Tyler: Aw, hell no. People have asked, but it&#x2019;s like why would I do that when I don&#x2019;t even wear your shit and hate your brand? That was on one of my goal lists, to be in a lookbook for Supreme, so that was as close as I got. I was really fuckin&#x2019; happy. It was so tight. Aaron [Bondaroff] put that together. Hi Aaron!</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.z"> GQ: <strong>What is Supreme doing that no one else is getting right? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.10"> Tyler: Nothing. That&#x2019;s what it is, that&#x2019;s why I like them. If that nothing makes any fucking sense. Everybody else is trying something, and they&#x2019;re just doing it. I have to fart.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.11">[<em>Later on, GQ caught up with Glenn to ask a few more questions...]</em></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.12"> GQ:<strong> Glenn, how do you wear Supreme as an adult male, versus how Tyler and his friends might wear it? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.13"> Glenn: Well, I tuck my shirt in.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.14"> GQ: <strong>How can dudes incorporate Supreme stuff into a look that&#x2019;s more polished? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.15"> Glenn: You just wear the right size. I&#x2019;ve been buying their chinos for years, I think they&#x2019;re just the best; they also have very nice jeans. And I think those things mix perfectly&#x2014;you could wear them with a tweed sportcoat or a blazer. I don&#x2019;t like to dress head-to-toe in any designer or brand, but a lot of this stuff integrates really well into a wardrobe. The T-shirts are really well made, and they have a stretchy panel down the side so that they actually fit right. A lot of thought goes into these clothes.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.16"> GQ: <strong>What&#x2019;s your impression of Tyler&#x2019;s music? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.17"> Glenn: To me, it&#x2019;s almost like stand-up comedy with a beat.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.18"> GQ: <strong>And you&#x2019;ve seen Odd Future&#x2019;s videos? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.19"> Glenn: Yeah.</p><p data-reactid=".w2zyq6htz4.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> GQ: <strong>What did you think? </strong></p><p
