  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestFacebookPinterestPhoto: Chuck Pulin/ Splash News/ Corbis\u000A\u000AJimmy Iovine is in his sixties now, but he still carries himself like a teenager. He\u0027s wiry and friendly, and he can\u0027t sit still. It\u0027s easy to see him as the kid he was when he started sweeping floors in a New York recording studio at 19. Almost a year later, 1973, he creates his big break: John Lennon is in the studio, recording a solo album. Iovine tinkers with a track Lennon\u0027s been struggling with. Lennon hears it and, grateful to Iovine, says, \u0022Stay in the chair.\u0022\u000A\u000AWord gets around about Iovine. Two years later, he\u0027s the sound engineer on Bruce Springsteen\u0027s Born to Run. Through the \u002770s and \u002780s, his reputation grows, the names pile up. Tom Petty. Patti Smith. U2. In 1990, Iovine starts a record label, Interscope. One day a young rapper comes in, plays a track. The guy is Andre Young, a.k.a. Dr. Dre. The album is The Chronic. Over the next two decades, Iovine signs Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Nine Inch Nails, Lady Gaga. Too many to name.\u000A\u000ACut to 2006. Dre tells Iovine he\u0027s getting offers to do a sneaker line. \u0022Screw sneakers,\u0022 Iovine says. \u0022Let\u0027s do speakers.\u0022 Frustrated by the lack of quality headphones to go with the iPod, they start the headphones line Beats by Dr. Dre, which soon expands into a streaming business. This spring, Iovine and Dre sold it all to Apple for $3 billion, and Iovine stepped down as chairman of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M. Apple bought him, too—to help the company imagine the future and, in the words of Iovine, \u0022make a service that is as compelling as the music.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHow did Apple come to buy Beats?\u000A\u000A I convinced them that they had to buy this company. I said, \u0022I don\u0027t want to work for anybody else. I want to do this at Apple. I know I can achieve this at Apple. I don\u0027t want to shop it. I wanna come here, to Steve\u0027s company. I know you guys; I know what you\u0027re capable of; I know you get popular culture. I know you have a hole in music right now; let me plug it.\u0022 I think it was two years before they said yeah.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Dan Winters\u000A\u000AWhat do you mean they had a \u0022hole\u0022 in music?\u000A\u000A After Steve died, and with the rise of streaming, I could see they needed something. Beats Music fit.\u000A\u000AYou grew up in Red Hook—\u000A\u000A I came from Brooklyn. My nickname was Moochie. My father was incredible, a longshoreman; my mother was a secretary. Very \u0022go to work\u0022 people. That\u0027s how I saw things. I loved music, and I wanted to do something different.\u000A\u000AWhen did you get turned on to music?\u000A\u000A Very simple: \u0022She Loves You.\u0022 Boom! I was on the floor of my mother\u0027s house, looking at an RCA television, waiting for the Beatles to come on.\u000A\u000AYou never thought of music before that?\u000A\u000A No. It was like getting burnt. You remember it.\u000A\u000AJohn Lennon once asked you why you got into music. And you lied to him.\u000A\u000A Well, yeah, because you\u0027ve got a Beatle asking you. You know, I\u0027m 20 years old, and he goes, \u0022Why are you doing this?\u0022 I said, \u0022I saw you guys on Ed Sullivan; I bought a guitar, and I wanted to be in a band. And I realized I couldn\u0027t be in a band, so I wanted to get as close to it as I can.\u0022 I said, \u0022John, why\u0027d you get into it?\u0022 He said, \u0022To get laid.\u0022 I said, \u0022Fuck, that\u0027s why I got into it!\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000AWhich is interesting, because you gained success with these artists by being brutally honest with them. The power of the truth, right?\u000A\u000A Every day. Springsteen and Patti [Smith] were so uncompromising. They were going for greatness. And in the studio, remember: The truth is attached to something. I was always able to care about their music as much as they did. When I was in there with them, there was nothing else I gave a shit about in life. Nothing. Not even myself.\u000A\u000ASee, I\u0027m a sponge. I can\u0027t learn in school, but I can learn from somebody who I think is cool and great. I have a gift: I\u0027m very lucky to be able to spot when a person is special. I\u0027m good at casting my life, you know?\u000A\u000AHow did you meet Dre?\u000A\u000A Him and Suge [Knight, then CEO of Death Row Records] came in, and they brought The Chronic. I\u0027d just come out of Rattle and Hum with U2. I knew hip-hop was going around, but I had no idea what it was. And then Dre walked in, and I said, \u0022I don\u0027t know hip-hop, but I know my speakers. Who engineered it?\u0022 Dre said, \u0022I did.\u0022 When they told me the story of how they made the record, you might as well make a record falling out of a building. They were sneaking into studios; the government was after them; there were lawsuits, one RICO case, all on a bunch of guys who had no money and were making an album. I said, \u0022Wow. If you can do it under those circumstances, let\u0027s go.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Stefanie Keenan/ Getty Images for Genetic Los Angeles\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve said that the motto of Beats is: Everything we know could possibly be wrong already.\u000A\u000A I approach everything like that. If you don\u0027t think that, you\u0027re old, whether you\u0027re 25 or 55. And it\u0027s scary to keep moving. [David] Geffen\u0027s been telling me for thirty years: \u0022Don\u0027t define yourself by your job, or else you\u0027re not going to be able to move forward. You\u0027ll be trapped.\u0022 He pounded that into my head. Life is a balance of fear and overcoming it. You can use fear as a tailwind or a headwind. I\u0027m most proud that I thought of Beats at 55. Dre and I want to move the needle on the culture. That\u0027s everything to me. \u0022We caused it.\u0022 I\u0027d say it\u0027s more important than money, but you wouldn\u0027t believe me.\u000A\u000AAll I can tell you is how I feel. I feel open to anything. Here\u0027s an example. In 1998, Death Row was exploding; \u0027Pac got killed just before; everything was fuckin\u0027 upside-down. And my assistant got married, so they put in a temp. And the kid had balls. He said, \u0022I went to this rap battle last night. I saw this kid who was incredible.\u0022 I said, \u0022Figure out how to get a CD from that kid, and I\u0027ll play it for Dre.\u0022 Next day, he comes back: \u0022Here it is.\u0022 I listen to it, and I go, \u0022I have no idea what the fuck this is.\u0022 This guy is screaming about his mother; he wants to kill his mother. I come from a place where you don\u0027t kill your mother. Right? I saw Dre, and I gave it to him. The rest is a fabulous story. His name was Eminem.\u000A\u000AIs there anything I haven\u0027t asked you that you want to—\u000A\u000A Just my relationship with Dre. I want to make sure that\u0027s—\u0027cause that\u0027s really a special thing. We trust each other implicitly. It\u0027s the closest to a band as I was ever in. We know what each other does, and we trust each other\u0027s instincts so much, that when he\u0027s moving somewhere and I go, \u0022No,\u0022 he goes, \u0022Okay, let\u0027s not do that.\u0022 We\u0027ve been through a lot; this is a guy—I always say, \u0022You may know a lot of people who have gotten shot, but you don\u0027t know a lot of people who have shot back.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat is peace for you?\u000A\u000A When you wake up in the morning and you can be present. When I go up to Apple to work on this music service we\u0027re doing, I\u0027m in it. [He spends a couple of days a week at Apple headquarters in Cupertino.] I\u0027m in that spot from 1973, in the studio, just saying, \u0022I\u0027ve gotta crack the code on this thing.\u0022 But I got it. It doesn\u0027t have me. The holy grail is peace, with ambition. Otherwise, you\u0027ve wasted your life.\u000A\u000AAnd did \u0022it\u0022 used to have you?\u000A\u000A It used to drive me. It was driving. And I wish I had been more chill, more happy about the work. But I was miserable. I was just working. I was like, \u0022Okay, you\u0027re supposed to feel scared and freaked out and wanting to win and make hit records.\u0022 So I did it twenty hours a day, seven days a week. That\u0027s all I did.\u000A\u000AIf you were advising the 19-year-old Jimmy, what would you say?\u000A\u000A Get your bullshit out of your way and be open-minded. And then I\u0027d push him in the direction of marrying technology and content. Most technology companies are culturally inept, and most entertainment companies are technologically inept. You can\u0027t live like that anymore.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s it. You gotta be open like that, no matter how much helium you got, no matter how much money you got—you can\u0027t be defined by the success. Yeah, my relationships are helped because of all the success I\u0027ve had, but I\u0027m only as useful as the idea I have today or tomorrow. Otherwise, I\u0027m just a trophy.\u000A\u000AMichael Hainey (@MichaelHainey) is GQ\u0027s deputy editor and the author of After Visiting Friends: A Son\u0027s Story.",

He&#x2019;s wiry and friendly, and he can&#x2019;t sit still. It&#x2019;s easy to see him as the kid he was when he started sweeping floors in a New York recording studio at 19. Almost a year later, 1973, he creates his big break: John Lennon is in the studio, recording a solo album. Iovine tinkers with a track Lennon&#x2019;s been struggling with. Lennon hears it and, grateful to Iovine, says, &quot;Stay in the chair.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.2">Word gets around about Iovine. Two years later, he&#x2019;s the sound engineer on Bruce Springsteen&#x2019;s <em>Born to Run.</em> Through the &#x2019;70s and &#x2019;80s, his reputation grows, the names pile up. Tom Petty. Patti Smith. U2. In 1990, Iovine starts a record label, Interscope. One day a young rapper comes in, plays a track. The guy is Andre Young, a.k.a. Dr. Dre. The album is <em>The Chronic.</em> Over the next two decades, Iovine signs Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Nine Inch Nails, Lady Gaga. Too many to name.</p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.3">Cut to 2006. Dre tells Iovine he&#x2019;s getting offers to do a sneaker line. &quot;Screw sneakers,&quot; Iovine says. &quot;Let&#x2019;s do speakers.&quot; Frustrated by the lack of quality headphones to go with the iPod, they start the headphones line Beats by Dr. Dre, which soon expands into a streaming business. This spring, Iovine and Dre sold it all to Apple for $3 billion, and Iovine stepped down as chairman of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M. Apple bought <em>him,</em> too&#x2014;to help the company imagine the future and, in the words of Iovine, &quot;make a service that is as compelling as the music.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.5"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>How did Apple come to buy Beats?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong> </strong>I convinced them that they had to buy this company.

[David] Geffen&#x2019;s been telling me for thirty years: &quot;Don&#x2019;t define yourself by your job, or else you&#x2019;re not going to be able to move forward. You&#x2019;ll be trapped.&quot; He pounded that into my head. Life is a balance of fear and overcoming it. You can use fear as a tailwind or a headwind. I&#x2019;m most proud that I thought of Beats at 55. Dre and I want to move the needle on the culture. That&#x2019;s <em>everything</em> to me. &quot;We caused it.&quot; I&#x2019;d say it&#x2019;s more important than money, but you wouldn&#x2019;t believe me.</p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.s">All I can tell you is how I feel. I feel open to anything. Here&#x2019;s an example. In 1998, Death Row was exploding; &#x2019;Pac got killed just before; everything was fuckin&#x2019; upside-down. And my assistant got married, so they put in a temp. And the kid had balls. He said, &quot;I went to this rap battle last night. I saw this kid who was incredible.&quot; I said, &quot;Figure out how to get a CD from that kid, and I&#x2019;ll play it for Dre.&quot; Next day, he comes back: &quot;Here it is.&quot; I listen to it, and I go, &quot;I have no idea what the fuck this is.&quot; This guy is screaming about his mother; he wants to kill his mother. I come from a place where you don&#x2019;t kill your mother. Right? I saw Dre, and I gave it to him. The rest is a fabulous story. His name was Eminem.</p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>Is there anything I haven&#x2019;t asked you that you want to&#x2014;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong> </strong>Just my relationship with Dre. I want to make sure that&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x2019;cause that&#x2019;s really a special thing. We trust each other implicitly. It&#x2019;s the closest to a band as I was ever in. We know what each other does, and we trust each other&#x2019;s instincts so much, that when he&#x2019;s moving somewhere and I go, &quot;No,&quot; he goes, &quot;Okay, let&#x2019;s not do that.&quot; We&#x2019;ve been through a lot; this is a guy&#x2014;I always say, &quot;You may know a lot of people who have gotten shot, but you don&#x2019;t know a lot of people who have shot back.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>What is peace for you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong> </strong>When you wake up in the morning and you can be present. When I go up to Apple to work on this music service we&#x2019;re doing, I&#x2019;m <em>in</em> it. <em>[He spends a couple of days a week at Apple headquarters in Cupertino.]</em> I&#x2019;m in that spot from 1973, in the studio, just saying, &quot;I&#x2019;ve gotta crack the code on this thing.&quot; But I got <em>it.</em> It doesn&#x2019;t have <em>me.</em> The holy grail is peace, with ambition. Otherwise, you&#x2019;ve wasted your life.</p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>And did &quot;it&quot; used to have you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.y"><strong> </strong>It used to <em>drive</em> me. <em>It</em> was driving. And I wish I had been more chill, more happy about the work. But I was miserable. I was just working. I was like, &quot;Okay, you&#x2019;re supposed to feel scared and freaked out and wanting to win and make hit records.&quot; So I did it twenty hours a day, seven days a week. That&#x2019;s <em>all</em> I did.</p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>If you were advising the 19-year-old Jimmy, what would you say?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong> </strong>Get your bullshit out of your way and be open-minded. And then I&#x2019;d push him in the direction of marrying technology and content. Most technology companies are culturally inept, and most entertainment companies are technologically inept. You can&#x2019;t live like that anymore.</p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.11">That&#x2019;s it. You gotta be open like that, no matter how much helium you got, no matter how much money you got&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t be defined by the success. Yeah, my relationships are helped because of all the success I&#x2019;ve had, but I&#x2019;m only as useful as the idea I have today or tomorrow. Otherwise, I&#x2019;m just a trophy.</p><p data-reactid=".my4zaz3d34.1.1.0.0.4.12"><a href="../contributors/zach-baron"><strong>Michael Hainey</strong></a> <a
