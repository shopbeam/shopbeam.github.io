John Jeremiah Sullivan contemplates the coming battle between man and beast\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022Human history is mainly the history of human customs, and we know very little of animal history from this point of view. Nevertheless animals do change their customs.\u0022—John Burdon Sanderson Haldane, British Geneticst, What is Life?, 1947 \u000A\u000A\u0022Animals are changing, and I cannot tell you why.\u0022—Inusiq Nasalik, 88-year-old inuit elder, September 6, 2004 \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Last year I was asked to write an article for this magazine about the future of the human race, a topic on which my sporadic descents to the crushing mental depths of pop-rock culture crit had predictably made me the go-to guy. Nonetheless I undertook in all good faith to fulfill the assignment. The future of the human race is something we ought to take seriously, since despite all the fortunes spent on those giant space-monitoring radio dishes and the exploratory satellites and whatnot, there exists not a shred of conclusive evidence to contradict the rational assumption that away from this blue ball we live on, the universe is an infinity of unfeeling matter. So let\u0027s keep this thing going, is my take.\u000A\u000A Pursuing insight, I spent a couple of days at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oord University in England. I called the woman I\u0027d been told was the most farsighted person at FEMA. I talked to any self-identifying and not instantly, obviously insane futurologist who\u0027d answer a query—Bill Lilly at the New School for Human Advancement was especially accommodating. I spoke with someone at the Vatican. The Vatican actually has a future expert, essentially a house Book of Revelation wonk. In short, I want you to know that I tried and tried, for months, to write about something other than what I\u0027ve ended up writing on here, a tangent that came up early in the research but immediately screamed career killer and was repeatedly shunted aside by this reporter in favor of things like out-of-control nanotechnology of the near future (which, you\u0027ll be delighted to hear, is something they\u0027re fairly concerned about at the Future of Humanity Institute). But as I tried every way I knew to find some legitimate half-truths about the future for you to read about on your flight to Dallas or wherever your loved ones live—and I do suggest that you visit them soon, as in this year, I really do—the problem became that people who make a profession of thinking seriously about the future won\u0027t really tell you anything that isn\u0027t cautious, hedged, and quadruple-qualified, because, as I came slowly to comprehend and deal with, no one knows what\u0027s going to happen in the future.\u000A\u000A My surprise at this pretty obvious-seeming realization showed me the extent to which, thanks to Hollywood or my own paranoia or whatever, I\u0027d unconsciously internalized a belief in the existence of some guy, some prematurely middle-aged guy, either Jewish or Asian (or, in the comedy version I sometimes screen internally, Irish), who sits in a room in the bowels of some governmental building and actually knows what\u0027s going to happen in the future, whose mutterings need to be heeded, whose moods must be tracked with concern if not alarm, and whose very existence is a cause all over the world of slight, constant anxiety, and properly so. Is this a dying spasm of the religion gene? Probably. All I know is that it came as a great liberation to me, having this creature expunged from my imagination, with his alert levels and his survival kits and all his total crap that he goes on about while with the left hand building nukes and starting wars. I reminded myself that incessant potential catastrophe is the human condition, is in fact the price of possessing consciousness, and I determined to live with greater ease from now on, and not to let anyone scare me about the future, because the truth is, the worst thing that could ever happen to you is death, and that\u0027s going to happen despite all your worry and effort, so it\u0027s simply irrational not to say fuck it. I\u0027m not saying start chain-smoking cloves and having unprotected sex with seaport trannie bar girls, though neither am I saying to abjure those things if they\u0027re what make you feel most alive. I\u0027m just saying, take courage. That and pretty much that alone is never the incorrect thing to do. And these thoughts were so edifying to me, and I really looked forward to sharing them with you, hoping they might lighten your load along the road.\u000A\u000A Then I was introduced to a person called Marcus Livengood.\u000A\u000A Good day, sunshine.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A A question that lately has been getting knocked around a lot in the better biology departments is this: As we intrude on, clear-cut, burn, pollute, occupy, cause to become too hot or too dry, or otherwise render unsuitable to wildlife a larger and larger percentage of the planet, what will be involved in terms of the inevitable increased human exposure to remnant populations of truly wild fauna? Not for us but for them. What sort of changes, adaptations, and responses might we look for in the animals themselves as the pressures of this global-biological endgame begin to make themselves felt at the level of the individual organism? We have in mind here not microevolutionary changes to existing species but stress-related behavior modification, so-called \u0022phenotypic plasticity,\u0022 the sort of thing we know numerous animal groups to be capable of, though it is rarely witnessed. Or was rarely witnessed. Now it seems to be cropping up everywhere, as even a casual viewer of nature shows can attest. Across numerous species and habitat types, we are seeing, in crudest terms, animals do things we haven\u0027t seen them do before.\u000A\u000A I\u0027m tiptoeing around saying anything direct here because I feel what I hope is an understandable sheepishness in reporting on this subject at all, so sharply does it smack of quackery and gullibility; on top of that, it should be clear by now that I take no pleasure in freaking anyone out. What I can tell you is that this thing is real, that it has proved harder rather than easier for reasonable and informed people to deny, and that, however modest and obscure continues to be the small community of researchers and analysts and bloggers who have thus far commented on it and made the first steps toward charting its dimensions, you are going to be hearing a lot more about it in the next ten to twenty years. Even the Future of Humanity Institute is going to want to pay attention to this one, even though its origin lies rather far, academically speaking, from the stone paths of Oord.\u000A\u000A Centerbrook, in southern Ohio, embodies a type of small-town college familiar to anyone who grew up or was educated in the Midwest. It started out in the nineteenth century as some sort of vocational academy, a normal school or a technical school, and accrued its university status over time, adding a department here or a professor there as qualified academics moved back from the Northeast to retire or take care of Mom, until one day all that was left was to stamp it a liberal-arts institution. No one ever got a good job just by saying they went there, but the students, on the days I visited, seemed sharp and ambitious. Many of them were a good decade past 1822. And although the campus isn\u0027t pretty—it\u0027s all naked brick and parking lots—there was an atmosphere of seriousness about what they were up to there.\u000A\u000A Professor Marcus Livengood, who goes by Marc to the point of indulging \u0022Mr. Marc\u0022 among his students, attended Centerbrook before getting his Ph.D. in comparative zoology at UC Santa Clara. He then took a job in the life-sciences department at his undergraduate alma mater. When I showed up forty minutes late for our appointment, he was alone in his surprisingly gigantic office. I\u0027ve never seen a person easier to describe physically. He looks like a young George Lucas. Same head shape, same beard, squint, everything, only taller and not pudgy yet and without the gray. Also, Mr. Livengood wears a ponytail. He wore, too, the heavy square glasses that all rogue scientists are commanded to wear when they are inducted into the Rogue Scientist Lodge. With what struck me as no mean feel for theater, as if we hadn\u0027t already been e-mailing for weeks, he said, \u0022So you\u0027re here to talk about the animals?\u0022\u000A\u000A Whatever process led to this interview had begun about a year before. I fear I\u0027ll be trading away some much, much needed credibility by confessing this up front, but it began for me on the Internet. Not on kook sites, mind you; I didn\u0027t spend any time on the kook sites until a good bit later, until I got mid up with Marc, in fact. This was at AOL, American Online, which I, like many others, use to connect to the Internet every day and check my messages. One thing that happens when you connect via America Online is that this little list of news headlines pops up on the welcome page, and you can follow them to the relevant articles. You know this. Well, someone there in a pulsating cubicle on the company\u0027s editorial floor, a person entrusted with sifting through all the different wire reports from all over the planet and deciding what merited attention, started seeing something, a pattern. I wish there were a way to determine this person\u0027s identity (I\u0027ve tried), because these days I consider him or her a curious sort of brother or sister in arms. In any event, it seemed like every day, once a week at a minimum, there\u0027d be a far-out animal-attack story.\u000A\u000A Not really that, though. An animal-attack story is a mountain lion pouncing on a jogger, a bear busting into someone\u0027s car, a surfer losing a leg. Granted, that sort of thing looks to be on the rise, too, in many parts of the world. But that\u0027s a story we know. Species self-protection + everybody loving the outdoors = occasional kills. We\u0027re talking here about stories having to do with changes in the nature and lethality of animal aggression. Solely in order to go ahead and escort an elephant out of the room here, let\u0027s just say it: We\u0027re talking about things like what happened to Steve Irwin.\u000A\u000A Yes, the Irwin story has long since turned into a butt for bloggers\u0027 macabre jokes. I won\u0027t make them myself: The man had a little girl, little Bindi. Indeed it was while filming scenes for her show that Irwin perished, a coincidence she\u0027s been mentioning on-air repeatedly ever since, for reasons best known to her. The fact remains that in the roughly 300 years during which human beings have been both (a) swimming, unknowingly or not, above giant stingrays in shallow water and (b) recording unusual things that happened to them in the ocean generally, there has been not a single instance of a stingray spiking someone to death in the heart, which is what happened to Irwin. The barbed end of the stingray\u0027s tail—over which, I\u0027m told, rays have unholy power of control and accuracy; they kill tiny, tiny fish with it—passed directly in between two of Irwin\u0027s ribs and into his left ventricle. He stood up, pulled it out, and died. There was video of this, but the Irwin family has destroyed it. In the weeks following, Australians began killing rays in the coastal waters. Police and beachcombers were finding mangled carcasses. But Michael Hornby, director of Irwin\u0027s Wildlife Warrior fund, issued a statement disavowing these acts and making clear that it would \u0022not accept and not stand for anyone who\u0027s taken a form of retribution\u0022 on the rays.\u000A\u000A Freaky things happen all the time in the world. I suppose everything has to happen for the first time at some point. Which is what one told oneself about the Irwin story. We\u0027d gone 300 years without an incident like this; if we could go 300 more, we\u0027d be all right. Clear snorkels, divers!\u000A\u000A We went six weeks. On October 19, 2006, in the waters off Boca Raton, Florida, a man named James Bertakis was boating with a family friend when a giant stingray leapt out of the water and into his lap. And it\u0027s important to visualize this correctly. Because it landed on his actual lap, with Bertakis in a sitting position, empty-handed—he had no rod—and the ray landed facing him, so they were eye to eye. This scene was described in some detail by the woman present. Bertakis and the ray were staring at each other, and it was flexing its tail. And then, bang. Up over its body and directly into the heart muscle, the heartflesh, inches deep. Reporters immediately asked the internationally regarded marine biologists at the University in Miami if there could be any connection, but Dr. Bob Cowen, the researcher put forward as spokesperson by the department, responded that he could \u0022not imagine any connection\u0022 and that the attacks were \u0022just two really unusual situations.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Except not,\u0022 said Livengood.\u000A\u000A We were sitting now, and I\u0027d just read off that quotation, along with several others, in order to suggest—politely, I hoped—that the position held by those in his profession who might be called mainstream is that what seems like a change in global animal behavior is really just an increase in media attention, or a string of coincidences that get stitched together on the Internet, or most charitably, an increase in the exposure of individual human beings to undomesticated animals as our habitats expand and the animals become more desperate for food sources, more willing to venture out.\u000A\u000A \u0022What do you mean, \u0027Except not\u0027?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Except they weren\u0027t unusual.\u0022\u000A\u000A I assumed he meant there\u0027d been other barb-to-heart ray attacks and asked if he\u0027d be willing to share the data with me.\u000A\u000A \u0022Rays? No,\u0022 he said. \u0022Or at least those are the only two we\u0027ve seen. But everything else...\u0022 He looked up into the corner with his head tilted as if I\u0027d told him to pose for a picture that way. Then he popped to his feet.\u000A\u000A \u0022You want to see our file?\u0022 he asked. He\u0027d gone over to another, larger computer in the corner of his office and was messing around on it.\u000A\u000A I\u0027d already shown him my file, when we first sat down. Mine was in a manila folder. It contained cutouts and printouts of all the articles I\u0027d archived in the preceding year. Most of them I\u0027d e-mailed first to friends with little jokey subject headers along the lines of gird thyself. It was one of the lucky recipients who replied, after the thirtieth or fortieth message, \u0022Did you know there\u0027s actually a guy who believes this is happening?\u0022 When I wrote back saying, \u0022Yes: myself,\u0022 he sent another message, saying, \u0022Right, but this guy studies animals.\u0022\u000A\u000A When I proffered my folder, he actually loudly laughed and said, \u0022That\u0027s what we get in a week, since people found out about us.\u0022\u000A\u000A I won\u0027t play dumb with you. I already knew at this point that by \u0022us\u0022 he meant not him and his colleagues but him and a bunch of isolated obsessives—bloggers and amateur naturalists and sci-fi people dizzy with their first taste of contrarian legitimacy and also, I suppose, people like me who become helplessly fixated for no honorable reason on cabalistic patterns in the news. This \u0022us,\u0022 if it\u0027s even an \u0022us,\u0022 doesn\u0027t have a good acronym yet and hasn\u0027t given any papers at conferences or generated much of a media profile at all, really, apart from a few stray \u0022opposing point of view\u0022 quotes in wire-service articles like the ones I\u0027d gathered.\u000A\u000A \u0022Check this out,\u0022 Livengood said, sliding his chair to the side to make room for me. On the screen was a large parti-color map of the world, in a circular shape like an old navigational map. The landmasses and coastlines were thickly riddled with tiny black dots, about pencil-tip size. There were maybe twenty stray black dots on the open seas. Livengood said—breezily, like someone giving an office tour to the new guy—\u0022Those are all confirmed, and those are all in the past six years.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022What are they, exactly?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Start clicking on them.\u0022\u000A\u000A I sat there for at least half an hour. At one point, he got up and went off down the hall. It was true that the sheaf of articles I\u0027d been so proud of was a Cracker Jack flip-book in comparison with what Livengood had collected. I should say that for an item to make his list, it must stand up to the admittedly soft but at least not nonexistent test of being (a) not a hoax—that is, independently verifiable as an incident through follow-up research—and (b) not the result of some obvious confusion. I invite you to verify these things as well, through Google or LexisNexis or in a few cases an article in Animal Behavior Abstracts (a complete set of which sat on the shelves behind Livengood\u0027s desk); you won\u0027t find them in the Weekly World News, either, but on the BBC Web site, the AP, Science, and Nature, places that have a vested interest in not getting fooled. Anyway, I assure you I don\u0027t know enough about even the normal goings-on in the animal kingdom to fabricate this many anomalies.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Soon I figured out that some of the little dots, when you clicked on them, led to multiple incidents, signifying vectors of activity, usually but not always confined to a single species. There are four small English seaport towns, for instance, where various seabirds have started targeting people. A swan came out of the water there and took a dog under. Indeed, when measured in actual numbers, birds may be the single most active species in terms of manifesting whatever lies underneath this shift. In Boston, for the past few years, there\u0027s been what can only be called an ongoing siege of wild turkeys. Children and old people getting attacked. In Sonoma County, California, the chicken population not long ago carried out \u0022a flurry of attacks on neighborhood children.\u0022 The mother of one of the victims told a reporter, \u0022It\u0027s not charming when you have to see your baby attacked...seeing the blood going down his face and seeing him screaming.... I can\u0027t sleep at night.\u0022\u000A\u000A A fair share of the new violence is animal-on-animal. Needless to say, it garners less attention in the media. In the Polish village of Stubienko, in June of 2000 (one of the earlier blips in Livengood\u0027s collection), the storks went crazy and started slaughtering chickens, hundreds of them. (There were, I\u0027m noticing only now, additional reports of \u0022sporadic attacks on humans\u0022 at the time.) Observers were \u0022at a loss to explain the aberrant behavior.\u0022\u000A\u000A You see what I mean about there being something off in these stories. The storks started slaughtering the chickens.\u000A\u000A In reality much of the intra-animal violence seems to suggest sheer madness. Chimps have repeatedly been documented engaging in \u0022rape, wife beating, murder, and infanticide.\u0022 Elephants on the African savanna have been raping rhinoceroses, something that evidently is just as startling to science as it to the layperson.\u000A\u000A If you\u0027ve paid attention to one particular facet of this story as it\u0027s unfolded, you\u0027re likely to have read about the work of Gay Bradshaw, a psychologist and environmental scientist who\u0027s been tracking the accelerated mental degeneration of elephant populations in severely destabilized areas of Africa and Asia. She\u0027s an extremely well-regarded researcher whose work is adding up to maybe the most persuasive proof yet mounted that the psychological overlap between our psyches and those of the more developed animals has been massively underestimated when it comes to affection, suffering, stress, and we don\u0027t even know what areas. That\u0027s how I understand her work, at any rate. Earlier this year, a major magazine brought her to national attention, and she has a book deal, and to get to the point, she declined an interview, for which I blame her not even slightly; if I were an internationally respected animal scientist, I\u0027d drive cold muddy hours out of my way to avoid even a tangential meeting with Marc Livengood (not that I don\u0027t personally find him heroic). Nonetheless there is perhaps more of a kinship between their respective working theses than either would leap to admit. (Livengood regards Bradshaw with a bit of jealousy and eye rolling, I am sure you\u0027ll be shocked to learn.)\u000A\u000A In any case, Bradshaw\u0027s interests wouldn\u0027t lead her necessarily to be concerned with the animal-on-human part of the elephant breakdown—nonetheless, they are killing us, too, in numbers never imagined. More than a thousand victims in under a decade. Forty-four Nigerian communities \u0022erased\u0022 by rampaging elephants in a single migratory season. Some of the incidents have been quite spectacular, with multiple animals working in concert (as opposed to isolated or \u0022rogue\u0022 males, which frequently act up); they\u0027re storming through neighborhoods, turning on crowds. If you\u0027ve ever seen an elephant attack a human being, it\u0027s very personal looking anyway. They keep going after you when you\u0027re down. At least at first, you\u0027re conscious while they basically knock the bejeezus out of you with their trunks and then stomp you into the earth. In one place, the animals first rampaged, clearing the town, then broke into unprotected casks of locally brewed rice beer, then hurled themselves against electrified fences and died. Bradshaw writes that \u0022some biologists think that increased elephant aggression might comprise, in part, revenge against humans for accidental or deliberate elephant deaths.\u0022 Not to be outdone, \u0022angry villagers\u0022 are poisoning to death an average of twenty elephants each year, according to The New York Times.\u000A\u000A Indeed, as suggested by the tortured-ray carcasses that washed up in the wake of the Irwin killing, swift acts of human retaliation have not infrequently followed the more dramatic of the late attacks. In Salt Springs, Florida, where gators went berserk a year and a half ago and killed three women in a week, the citizens \u0022declared war on alligators.\u0022 That\u0027s how one busy trapper described it. \u0022People are really going crazy,\u0022 he said.\u000A\u000A In other cases, cooler heads have prevailed and more peaceful measures have been pursued. One example: In Bombay, earlier this year, a pack of leopards entered the town—just sauntered out of the forest at the heart of that city—and murdered a total of twenty-two people. J. C. Daniel, an environmentalist who has monitored the wildlife in that forest for forty years, said, \u0022We have to study why the animal is coming out. It never came out before.\u0022 But the people responded creatively. In hopes of calming the beasts—and with a gesture having weird overtones of the sacrificial offering to assuage angry cat gods—officials in the area are releasing hundreds and hundreds of little pigs and rabbits into the forest. (2 Kings 17:25: \u0022And when they began to dwell there, they feared not the Lord: and the Lord sent lions among them, which killed them.\u0022)\u000A\u000A In China it\u0027s the pets that are changing. The AP reported that \u0022about 90,000 people in Beijing have been attacked by dogs and cats in the first six months of this year, up almost 34 percent for the same period last year, the government said.\u0022 In America, where animals have perhaps a freer recourse to weapons, at least four people have been shot by their dogs in the past two years. One incident involved a stun gun. One reportedly took place while the animal was being beaten, its owner hoped, to death. That killing, then, could truly be described as self-defense. (In a third incident, in Memphis, a dog shot its owner in the back while the man was arguing with his girlfriend—this one may have been accidental.)\u000A\u000A A pack of 200 dogs descended out of the mountains—this was in Albania—ran straight into the middle of the town of Mamurras, and just started going after people—old people, young people, \u0022dragging them to the ground and inflicting serious wounds.\u0022 One witness spoke of a \u0022clearly identifiable leader.\u0022 (Lest we assume this to be a seasonal occurrence in Albania, the town\u0027s mayor, Anton Frroku, stated that \u0022even in the movies, I have never seen a horde of 200 stray dogs from the mountains attacking people in the middle of a town.\u0022)\u000A\u000A \u0022Clearly identifiable leader\u0022: Elsewhere, too, there are suggestions of organization, cooperation. In India one of the country\u0027s busiest highways has been repeatedly taken over and brought to a standstill by what the BBC has described as \u0022troops\u0022 of \u0022monkey raiders,\u0022 2,000 at a time. \u0022We have already seen that new troops have entered the area in recent weeks,\u0022 a local official tells the BBC. There was talk of \u0022relocating\u0022 them. In Britain, where the rat population has increased by 40 percent in the last decade, and old people are saying they haven\u0027t seen anything like it since the Blitz, scientists have pinned the otherwise inexplicable surge on the fact that the rats \u0022have been learning from other rats how to avoid the poisons.\u0022 Again, look at these numbers. We\u0027re seeing increases not of 4 or 5 percent but on the order of 40, 50 percent.\u000A\u000A In at least one situation, clearly discernible technological innovation has entered the picture. A community of chimpanzees living on the edges of the savanna in Senegal have learned to fashion and use spears, which they sharpen with their teeth. These are chimps we\u0027ve been observing for 200 years; they have never used spears. Now they\u0027ve begun spiking little bush babies with them. The bush babies hide in hollow trees. The chimps do a sort of frog-gigging number on them and pull them out like fondue. Within a year of the first chimp having been observed using a weapon this way, nine others had caught on and were recorded doing it in a total of twenty-two observed instances, suggesting that at least at the simian level these fairly radical behavioral changes are taking place within the span of a single generation.\u000A\u000A The science behind all this is, you might say, disturbingly fundamental. As the planet warms, evolution speeds. We\u0027ve known this for a long time. You learn it in college biology. Things evolve faster nearer the equator. Heat speeds up molecular activity. You have a population of squid—it divides. One branch hangs out up by Alaska, the other goes down to the coast of Peru. Go and visit them 50,000 years later. The group up by Alaska is slowly subdividing into two species. The one down by Peru has turned into twenty-six species and is no longer even recognizable. Well, these days the whole planet is experiencing that effect. More heat, more light. The animals are doing things differently; they\u0027re showing up places they\u0027re not supposed to go, sleeping at different times, eating different things. Talk with any fieldworker and it\u0027s a truism that the guidebooks are becoming obsolete at ten times the speed. As a researcher told the BBC in 2001, \u0022There is a genetic change in their response to daylight. We can detect this change over as short a time period as five years. Evolution is happening and it is happening very fast.\u0022 And he was only talking about a particular species of mosquito. Dr. Christina Holzapfel, at the University of Oregon in Eugene, has been watching changes among Canadian red squirrels. \u0022Phenotypic plasticity is not the whole story,\u0022 she told Sciencemagazine last year. \u0022Studies show,\u0022 another source quoted her as saying, \u0022that over the past several decades, rapid climate change has led to heritable, genetic changes in animal populations.\u0022 Most recently a piece in Smithsonian stated that \u0022lately there has been evidence that plants and animals are changing much faster.\u0022 What this means is that we picked a bad time to have all of the animals enraged at us, since just at the moment when their disposition might be expected to turn, they happen to be evolving like crazy.\u000A\u000A What stuck out above all else, as I clicked through Livengood\u0027s dots, was the same tendency that had presented itself when I was still just idly following news items on the Internet, namely, the extraordinary number of \u0022first time\u0022 attacks. That is, not simply unprecedented types of attack, such as leopard packs going forth and killing in a crowded city, but rather, pure cases of: animals that have never shown a desire to kill human beings before, killing them.\u000A\u000A It was only a couple of years ago, in an October 2006 posting on the Web site of the Institute for the Future—an \u0022independent nonprofit research group,\u0022 headquartered in the States, that puts its considerable budget toward working \u0022with organizations of all kinds to help them make better, more informed decisions about the future\u0022—that raised a first tentative flag on this whole issue, insofar as it marked the first time a group of nondismissible, intellectually clubable types had gone so far, had been explicit:\u000A\u000A \u0022File this under the wildest of wildcards, but are the number of attacks by animals formerly thought to be relatively harmless or difficult to provoke on the rise? Are there other interesting statistics suggesting an increase in the number of attacks by animals that previously were not especially aggressive?\u0022\u000A\u000A Blogger and fellow seeker Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, there sure as hell are.\u000A\u000A Attacks of dolphins on humans are noticeably up, with a particularly violent population repeatedly attacking swimmers off the coast of Canc&amp;#xFA;n, killing at least two, with several more unexplained drownings that may have been \u0022take under\u0022 incidents. Every marine biologist reached for comment after those confirmed attacks said the same thing: \u0022There\u0027s no such thing as a fatal dolphin attack.\u0022\u000A\u000A This news would be startling to Henri Le Lay, president of the Association of Fishermen and Yachtsmen at the port of Brézellec in Brittany, who spoke with reporters about \u0022a psychotic dolphin,\u0022 nicknamed Jean Floch, that has been going after fishermen in their boats. \u0022He\u0027s like a mad dog,\u0022 Le Lay said. \u0022I don\u0027t want to see any widows or orphans. This could end badly.\u0022\u000A\u000A Sea lions, too, are going after human beings for the first time. Not accidentally bumping into them but pursuing them through open water. In Alaska one jumped into a boat, knocked a fisherman overboard, and took him down. Sea lions are famous for fleeing any sort of conflict. Expert opinion? \u0022Abnormal behavior.\u0022\u000A\u000A Unlikely as it may sound, in the history of the European occupation of North America there is but a single recorded fatal attack by a wild but healthy (i.e., nonrabid, nonstarving) wolf on a human being. It happened in 2005, in Alaska. The guy went out to take a pee or maybe just to look at the stars. When they found him, he\u0027d already been worked over by scavengers.\u000A\u000A In Uganda and Tanzania, chimps \u0022struggling to survive amid the destruction of their forest habitat are snatching and killing human babies.\u0022 They\u0027ve taken sixteen in the past seven years and had killed half of those before anyone found them. The eating of babies is \u0022a recent development,\u0022 said the article.\u000A\u000A Click, click, click—they just kept coming. In Belarus the beavers have been attacking people (\u0022first recorded attack [in that country\u0027s long history] of a beaver on a human\u0022). This has happened again, in Lindesberg, Sweden, quite recently; a woman was hospitalized. The decidedly non-Swedish response of the townspeople, as reported by a city official? \u0022Four of the beavers in the river have been shot, and the rest will be exterminated. Then the beaver house will be blown up to prevent other families from taking it over.\u0022 Not comforting is a related report out of Washington, D.C., that states, \u0022Beavers are expanding rapidly into cities.\u0022\u000A\u000A For every account that seemed a little far-fetched and made me think a few qualifying facts must have been left out, there\u0027d be another that, while admittedly bizarre, had the instant ring of stuff you wouldn\u0027t make up, like the jogger in southeastern North Carolina who witnesses saw get surrounded on the boardwalk by a squadron of oversize male hermit crabs, which approached him, kung fu style, with that one bulging claw forward, and appeared to attempt to drive him off a pier. And as always with cases like these, the quote from the zoologist comes around like a mantra: First recorded...not known to have occurred previously...relevant literature was searched but no prior instances retrieved...experts shocked...abnormal...unheard of...\u000A\u000A When Livengood came back, I was six inches lower in the chair; I probably looked like a person whose mind had just been destroyed by a satanic video game.\u000A\u000A \u0022Still skeptical?\u0022 Livengood said. (When we\u0027d first spoken on the telephone, he\u0027d asked me what my \u0022take\u0022 was, and I\u0027d replied, \u0022Skeptically curious,\u0022 which I\u0027d intended to mean essentially nothing—but oh man it stuck with him.)\u000A\u000A I mumbled something.\u000A\u000A To which Livengood replied, with a sigh and a fake-bored tone, \u0022Oh yeah. Something\u0027s happening.\u0022\u000A\u000A Then he bounced for a minute in his black office chair, tapping his fingertips together.\u000A\u000A I said, \u0022It\u0027s impossible.\u0022\u000A\u000A Then he looked at me and said, as if not having heard me, \u0022Hey! You need to go to Africa with me!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A We were en route to a dry region in the northeast of Kenya, about 350 miles northeast of Nairobi, just before you hit the Somali border, a place called Mandera, although Marc insisted on saying repeatedly that we were \u0022going to ground zero.\u0022\u000A\u000A In the year 2000—which Marc repeatedly referred to as \u0022year zero\u0022—there were two separate incidents within a single month\u0027s time, not far from each other, in villages occupying this area. Marc referred to them as \u0022the battle site\u0022 and \u0022the kill site.\u0022 He\u0027d arranged for us to be met by a tall, extraordinarily upright young woman from Dakar named Sila Fall. Her hair was in braids, and she wore all white with a blue bandanna around her neck. She was the UNICEF liaison for this district. She took us down a road to a village; it looked more like a camp. But the people here were healthy. UNICEF was overseeing the digging of a new well. They asked us to sit and watch a sort of play, performed in Kikamba. I could just make out the plot. One man was sick; he was the patient; another man came, the healer. They spoke to each other—that ancient bond. They danced.\u000A\u000A We walked behind Sila Fall, who walked very fast. She showed us all the improvements UNICEF had made—though not so much with pride as with restlessness, as if to say, We\u0027ve at least done this. The clinic. The school. \u0022In 2000 it was not like this,\u0022 she said. \u0022In 2000, if it didn\u0027t get thrown from the back of an army truck, we didn\u0027t have it. We were dying.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022The woman lives here,\u0022 she said without stopping, \u0022but they say she is at her sister\u0027s today.\u0022 Seconds later, in front of another, identical hut, we did stop. I saw now that Marc was manifesting excitement through physical agitation, moving from foot to foot and emitting little herm sounds. From the shaded interior of the hut materialized a middle-aged woman in a long skirt and T-shirt. Sila Fall spoke to her in Kikamba, she spoke to Sila Fall in Kikamba, then Sila Fall said to Marc, \u0022She says that she welcomes you, she...knows who you are, and she will show you the place that you want to know about.\u0022 This, then, was Kakenya Wamboi, or as Marc called her in e-mails to me, \u0022the veteran.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A It\u0027s known that in the spring of 2000, when the drought conditions were at their worst in this district, there occurred a two-hour pitched battle between monkeys and human beings over access to three newly arrived water tankers. As the four of us walked beyond the narrow outskirts of the village, about 200 yards down a truly ovenishly hot road, Kakenya Wamboi, who participated in that event, was speaking through Sila Fall, answering Marc\u0027s extremely precise, obviously rehearsed questions, telling Marc and me the story of the fight, how the human beings had rushed to draw water from the tankers, yet within seconds an entire troop of monkeys had appeared. They ranged themselves along the edges of the tankers. Others came from across the road. \u0022They bit us and clawed at us. They threw stones at us from the top of the truck. My husband is dead, but until he died he had a mark on his forehead from where one of the stones cracked his skull. You don\u0027t know how strong they are! They struck ten people. Badly enough that we all ran off. The men went back with as. The monkeys were drinking all of the water. My husband said that they could work the valves. The drivers were still in the trucks. They were scared. The men went at the monkeys with as and had to kill eight of them before the rest ran off. The drivers would not stay in this village overnight as they usually do, so we had to draw all the water off in a rush; we didn\u0027t get it all before they started the trucks again. Some of what we got was in bad containers and spoiled, and the monkeys had already taken about a third of it. Of the people that died in that famine, the most of them died that spring, and my husband always said the monkeys killed them, that the monkeys won that battle.\u0022\u000A\u000A She made the gesture of, I suppose, a monkey swinging an ax in victory.\u000A\u000A At some point, Sila Fall interrupted her and said that we needed to go, because to reach the other place Marc wanted to see, we had to drive two hours, and we didn\u0027t want to be on that road after dark; it skirted the Somali border—he made a machine-gun sign—so we needed to say good-bye. Did Marc have any more questions?\u000A\u000A \u0022What sort of calls were they doing during the attack? What sounds were they making? Or weren\u0027t they making sounds?\u0022\u000A\u000A Kakenya Wamboi said that they were chattering the entire time. Not screaming. More like talking. Then she said something else. Sila Fall said, \u0022She says that she is glad to meet you and help you and that you see that she is very poor, you see her house, and she knows you are good people, and that she hopes you will help her.\u0022 To his credit, Marc looked at me.\u000A\u000A Knowing Marc Livengood a little now, you may appreciate the profundity of the Livengood silence during this car ride with Sila Fall. The man was seeing, I\u0027m sure, indescribable things. Sila Fall drove and talked, mostly about a period of years she spent in the United States. I was dying to ask her if she knew why Livengood was here or what it was that Livengood believed, but could neither do this in front of Marc nor figure a way to get them apart. Finally, the van swerved and slowed and through the seat we could feel the tires meeting the sudden resistance of sand. We got out and started to walk. I asked Sila Fall, \u0022Have you seen this place?\u0022\u000A\u000A She nodded. \u0022I grew up here.\u0022\u000A\u000A We walked for twenty minutes through a gap in a low sandstone formation. We came to what must have been the remnant of a sinkhole, a cavity in the earth the shape of an upside-down yarn cone. At the bottom was a pool of water. \u0022Healthy water,\u0022 Sila Fall said. There was one spot along the rim of the hole where you could slide and clamber down. \u0022I wasn\u0027t here in 2000,\u0022 Sila Fall said, \u0022but if it was as dry as they say, there was only a puddle down there. It was probably the only water for miles.\u0022\u000A\u000A In late February of that year, a herder named Ali Adam Hussein slid down to that puddle, probably not to slake his own thirst but to gather a little water for his cows. He looked up and saw several monkeys looking down at him. Presumably, he went to go for his weapon. The monkeys responded by lifting several stones and hurling them directly at his head. He died hours later of what a nurse back in Mandera, where we\u0027d just come from, described simply as \u0022severe head injuries.\u0022\u000A\u000A Marc did not ask Sila Fall\u0027s permission before he himself skidded down into the deep natural watering hole. Both Sila Fall and I watched him, somewhat stunned. He seemed to have acted on a sudden impulse. At the bottom, however, he immediately displayed purpose. He stood with his hip cocked, his ponytail jutting out through the back of his khaki Centerbrook University cap, grinning up at me through his beard. I said, \u0022Tell me what you\u0027re thinking.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m standing where he stood, John.\u0022 Marc Livengood is a man who likes to say your name at the end of sentences when he talks to you.\u000A\u000A \u0022And what does that mean?\u0022 I said. (These were not real questions; he just sometimes liked to force me to go through the whole production of baiting him, and I\u0027d adjusted to it.)\u000A\u000A \u0022What does it mean?\u0022 he said. \u0022It means I\u0027m standing where the First Victim stood.\u0022 He said the two words in such a way that I feel I have to capitalize the first letters of each. \u0022It means we are all three standing on the site of an incident unknown to the annals of natural science, and it is unstudied. We met the First Veteran and the First Victim today; you tell me what that means.\u0022 Then he took pictures for forty-five minutes.\u000A\u000A Finally able to converse with Sila Fall somewhat normally, I asked her, \u0022Do you know why he\u0027s here?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022He\u0027s a scientist,\u0022 she said.\u000A\u000A \u0022Specifically, I mean? You don\u0027t? Specifically, he believes that the animals are turning on us, that we\u0027re about to experience a war of animals on human beings, and that it\u0027s going to begin here. That it may already have begun here.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Do you believe that?\u0022 she asked.\u000A\u000A \u0022I don\u0027t think so,\u0022 I said. I didn\u0027t know how to tell her that she didn\u0027t need to be polite with me. She was there in a professional capacity. I suppose I was, too, in some deformed way. Really, it was stupid of me to be accosting her. But I\u0027d been listening to Marc nonstop since we\u0027d left the airport in Nairobi, and she seemed very adjusted.\u000A\u000A \u0022Most people would probably think he\u0027s insane,\u0022 I said.\u000A\u000A Sila Fall shrugged her shoulders. \u0022It\u0027s possible,\u0022 she said.\u000A\u000A \u0022Possible that he\u0027s insane or that there\u0027s about to be an animal-human war?\u0022\u000A\u000A She shrugged her shoulders again.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A The story runs into an obstacle here, because shortly after we arrived back in the States, Marc Livengood was fired from Centerbrook. Neither he nor anybody at the school will talk about it except to confirm that he\u0027s suing. From someone in the town who shall remain unidentified, I learned that he\u0027s living with his father, a retired engineer, in Dayton, or was as of two months before. The one time I got him to return a phone call and was able to ask him what had happened, he replied, in an almost boastful tone, \u0022John, when the story of this comes out, you, you...Let\u0027s just say Marc Livengood is not going to be what\u0027s disgraced by this, okay?\u0022 He refused to clarify that and hung up within maybe half a minute, sounding disgusted. A guy in the tech department at the school, whom I called in a Hail Mary way, told me he\u0027d heard his boss talking about it on the telephone and that it was all \u0022computer-related.\u0022\u000A\u000A Needless to say, it\u0027s been challenging, with Livengood underground, to push things forward. I couldn\u0027t get anybody else in the field to say anything about him, because nobody really knows anything about him; it had always just been an Internet thing. Even his colleagues at the school thought he was involved, as his chair put it to me, in \u0022a kind of curatorial project.\u0022 He\u0027d once been the subject of a profile in a magazine calledVarmint Masters, published out of Birmingham, Alabama. Once more, I invite you to research this. It\u0027s a real magazine. And these people have radically redefined the definition of the word varmint. They hunt camels, moose, things like that. Reading it, I get the sense that now and then some country, like Australia, will have a problem with an out-of-control population of some feral species and that these VMs will travel from the four corners with their bunker-busting rifles and such. But I haven\u0027t been able to find a copy of the Livengood issue, even on eBay, and cannot find contact info for the publisher in Birmingham. Is it possible that Livengood felt some sort of kinship with this subpopulation of men who work to become ever more expert hunters of animals not normally thought of as prey? Now there was no one to answer these questions. I found one guy, a marine biologist at a university on the West Coast—he asked me to name neither him nor the school—who remembered Livengood from a conference. He said, \u0022I actually thought some of what he was talking about was pretty interesting, but back then it was just about predatory patterns, dietary disturbances. It sounds like maybe he had some kind of crack-up or something. I mean, I\u0027m hearing about it from you.\u0022\u000A\u000A And I was hearing about it from Livengood. We were all supposed to hear it from him and maybe will yet. That\u0027s the future, which, as I think we\u0027ve established, is fairly sketchy terrain to prance out onto without a sure hand to guide you. I present this essay, with its mere sliver of the material Livengood had gathered, with its shadow of an approximation of the boldness of thought he brought to bear on it, as a testament. I think about him every time I see another animal story in the news. The cat at the nursing home in Rhode Island that was able to predict which patients were about to die and would sit on their beds until they\u0027d expired? Marc Livengood had thoughts on that, be assured. And has them still.\u000A\u000A Pet loyalty, in fact, was a recurrent subject of his monologue on our last night together in Nairobi. Which eons of their training would prove genetically more persuasive when, for instance, the dogs were asked by the wolves to choose? Us or them, that\u0027s what it would come down to. Would they turn on us or defend us?\u000A\u000A That night, we sat at an uncomfortably tiny table at an open-air place about a mile from the airport. He talked. I drank, my pencil-hand flying. He spoke of how it would go, how it would really begin, stopping after every third or fourth sentence to hold up his hands in a \u0022stop\u0022 gesture and say, \u0022Speculation! Speculation!\u0022\u000A\u000A He conjured up one of the eeriest Armageddons I have ever heard described: existence on a planet that hasitself become treacherous. A rapidly approaching period of uncertainty and terror, waves of increased attacks from all over the earth, creatures coming up from the deep oceans to paralyze shipping, possibly at the sonic command of the dolphins. The forests will no longer be a place to camp. Troops of wildcats, deer, and moose. Ever seen hikers get stomped by a moose? It\u0027s like watching cans go through a can cruncher.\u000A\u000A For a while, everyone will cling to the hope that it\u0027s some kind of phase, and all sorts of comforting theories will be peddled: sunspots, magnetism in the earth\u0027s core, a different explanation every week, but always something to suggest that \u0022the power will come back on,\u0022 as Livengood liked to say.\u000A\u000A \u0022You have to understand,\u0022 he told me, \u0022these are normal biological systems functioning. We are a threat to the animals. They\u0027re just doing what nature has designed them to do. In this sense, there\u0027s nothing revolutionary at all about what I\u0027m arguing. You could even say there\u0027s nothing new about my work. Where it gets interesting is when you remember that we\u0027re a different kind of threat, right? We\u0027re presenting them with the prospect of more or less total global domination by a single species. The lower orders haven\u0027t seen this since the dinosaurs. And keep in mind they were undergoing a period of accelerated evolution, too. We always make it that the dinosaurs died, then mammals came forward. Why not at least entertain the idea that the mammals took over?\u0022\u000A\u000A We were quiet for a minute, sipping our tea.\u000A\u000A \u0022And keep in mind,\u0022 Marc continued, \u0022that there may be at this moment something like forty dolphins living in the open seas, escapees from marine defense programs. We don\u0027t know what they\u0027re trained to do. Carry explosives? Kill divers? I\u0027m looking for them to emerge in some sort of overt leadership capacity before 2010. It\u0027s the chimps on land and the dolphins in the seas. We can assume that they are working out some sort of mutually intelligible signal system now, probably on the West African coast.\u0022\u000A\u000A I asked him about the whole interspecies-cooperation thing, which has always and to some degree still does strike me as sheer sci-fi.\u000A\u000A \u0022Do you know Kropotkin\u0027s Mutual Aid?\u0022 he asked, and then, when he saw my blank look, added, \u0022Read it. The book\u0027s been out of print for probably a hundred years, but you should read it. He documented hundreds of instances of this—separate species helping one another. Kropotkin\u0027s finding was if two or more species are exposed to a shared threat, we will also see shared defense. The only question concerns the mechanism.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022What\u0027s it all going to look like?\u0022 This was my question.\u000A\u000A \u0022Unrecognizable,\u0022 he said. \u0022People moving about in packs. Depopulation. We don\u0027t know how far down the chain this realignment of animal consciousness is going to travel, for precisely the reason that we don\u0027t how far down consciousness penetrates. The insects—will they be involved? The rodent classes? The reptiles? You\u0027re just making armchair guesses at that point.\u0022\u000A\u000A I asked him which animal he was most worried about.\u000A\u000A \u0022That\u0027s hard,\u0022 he answered. \u0022I think about the dolphins, not because of their lethality—though it\u0027s underestimated constantly—but because I think they understand best, of all the species, what damage we\u0027ve done to the planet. They get the immensity of it. The other animals are responding to sudden infusions of hormones and little instinct triggers, but I believe that the dolphins are capable of hatred and that their hatred of us is essentially bottomless.\u000A\u000A \u0022Then, if you\u0027re talking scariest land animal to me, you might want to list the bear. Or rather, a combined chimp-and-bear onslaught, with a sort of Master Blaster power dynamic between chimps and bears. My God, bears can mess you up when they have a mind. Takes ten shots to stop one, routinely. Of course, by then we\u0027ll be firing on them with bazookas and whatnot. Hunting codes will be off. Still, fighting them is going to be the closest thing to fighting a human army. I fear the bears. Definitely. They know how to get into houses and cars. A species-wide rampage will be just... Fuck, man, part of keeping going in a professional capacity for me is keeping my mind off of stuff like that.\u0022\u000A\u000A He adjusted his glasses and looked around.\u000A\u000A \u0022Think about it like this,\u0022 he said. \u0022In the early eighteenth century, there were massive combined populations of enslaved blacks, embattled Indians, and poor-white servants living in North America. If at any moment they had truly woken up to the nature of their plight, which is to say the commonality of their plight, and identified its cause as the agenda of the Colonial ruling class, ours would not now be a mainly European continent, genetically speaking. The animals are making the same discovery about themselves. And I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll squander it.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022So you would say bears are scarier than dolphins in the end?\u0022 I asked him.\u000A\u000A \u0022You want scariest?\u0022 he said. \u0022Scariest is not the animals we know about. It\u0027s the animals we don\u0027t know about. Have you ever seen the statistics on estimated unknown species globally? We don\u0027t know half the crap that\u0027s alive on this planet, John. And I mean down at the very bottom of the ocean, in the Marianas Trench...that\u0027s an undiscovered planet, in terms of what\u0027s down there. And who knows what size those animals are, what they\u0027re capable of? Well, the animals may know. They may know what\u0027s down there, and they may know how to communicate with it.\u0022\u000A\u000A Have fear: That\u0027s what Marc Livengood taught me. What he teaches us. And if I\u0027ve in any way satisfied the expectations of this assignment, it\u0027s in coming away with that drop of distilled realism: You want to know what to be afraid of in the next fifty years? Everything. Everything that walks and crawls. Everything that moves. Because it hates us. \u0022Why do they hate us?\u0022 Remember that? How quaint it already seems, when you think we were so recently asking that question about one another! And yet maybe the answers are the same; maybe we can apply the lessons of the one to the other. They hate us because they can\u0027t be us. Can\u0027t have our thumbs, our brains, our music, our beautiful flowing hair. Can\u0027t have it can\u0027t have it can\u0027t have it. And right now, sure, I say that I feel bad about that. But in the moment, in the moment when I\u0027m letting explosive tracer rounds erupt from the mouth of my firemaker, just hosing metal right into the faces of a bunch of screaming giant eagles as they come for my daughter—and my cats, who will never betray me, not ever, or who have betrayed me and are scratching the dook out of my back while I struggle to aim—will I be thinking, \u0022Ah, too bad, wish we hadn\u0027t fucked you like that\u0022? Don\u0027t kid yourselves.\u000A\u000A We gave them so much. That\u0027s what gets me. What did they have before us? What did they do? We gave them jobs, we put them on television, we cried for their losses. It seems their idea of repayment is the tooth and the claw. I don\u0027t think we need them. Everything we need we can make from corn.\u000A\u000A Not that I don\u0027t hold out hope. If you and I are here in a half century, I hope we\u0027ll be celebrating the end of this war. I hope we\u0027ll be telling with highest zest, again and again till our great-grandchildren are sick of it, the story of the day of the accord, when we knew it was over. Of little Bindi Irwin, a woman now, wind in her face, her beauty still touched by a bit of Mad Max dog-boy ferality, as she was escorted out through the waves between white flags to a meeting with Dolphin Leader, where they brokered a détente in the chirpy language Steve had just finished teaching her when he got spiked. We, for our part, will have promised to live in greater harmony with Gaia.\u000A\u000A But I\u0027m not sure we\u0027ll ever say the world is ours again, not sure we\u0027ll ever really feel at home here again. That may be for the best. Being brave means saying, in every situation, \u0022I\u0027ll comport myself as I think honorable, no matter the risk and no matter what the voice of frowning power has to say about it.\u0022 That\u0027s the kind of thinking that\u0027ll get you raped by a rhino.\u000A\u000A Takeaway message? Let\u0027s get proactive. Starting with a subscription to Varmint Masters. We\u0027ve been working with this settled-agriculture shit over 10,000 years. What it\u0027s gotten us is a poisoned planet and a bunch of furious, mentally retarded beings with teeth and claws and tusks and tentacles and retractable poisoned darts and venom that they can spit and noses so strong they lift tanks and on and on and on, and what do we have? What were we given in this fight? Fucking thumbs. Fucking opposable thumbs. That\u0027s pretty weak, I\u0027m sorry. But guess what? Guess what, animales? We did something with those thumbs. We built these weapons. With them we are going to fire on you.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Big parts of this piece I made up. I didn\u0027t want to say that, but the editors are making me, because of certain scandals in the past with made-up stories, and because they want to distance themselves from me. Fine.\u000A\u000A I made up Marc Livengood. I made up the trip to Nairobi. But I didn\u0027t make up the two incidents in Kenya, the battles of monkeys and men and the murder. I did not fabricate a single one of the animal-related facts or stories, the incidents. There\u0027s even a real-life guy on the Internet whom I could have used in place of the made-up one, but that got messy, because he wanted money, and anyway, he was insane.\u000A\u000A Editor\u0027s note: Gay Bradshaw, Christina Holzapfel, and everyone at the Institute for the Future and the Future of Humanity Institute at Oord University are serious scholars and researchers who had nothing to do with this story and have never discussed animal violence with the author, much less endorsed any of his assertions, nor would they, presumably.\u000A\u000A John Jeremiah Sullivan is a GQ correspondent.",

Nonetheless I undertook in all good faith to fulfill the assignment. The future of the human race is something we ought to take seriously, since despite all the fortunes spent on those giant space-monitoring radio dishes and the exploratory satellites and whatnot, there exists not a shred of conclusive evidence to contradict the rational assumption that away from this blue ball we live on, the universe is an infinity of unfeeling matter. So let&#x2019;s keep this thing going, is my take.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.8"> Pursuing insight, I spent a couple of days at the Future of Humanity Institute at Oord University in England. I called the woman I&#x2019;d been told was the most farsighted person at FEMA. I talked to any self-identifying and not instantly, obviously insane futurologist who&#x2019;d answer a query&#x2014;Bill Lilly at the New School for Human Advancement was especially accommodating. I spoke with someone at the Vatican. The Vatican actually has a future expert, essentially a house Book of Revelation wonk. In short, I want you to know that I tried and tried, for months, to write about something other than what I&#x2019;ve ended up writing on here, a tangent that came up early in the research but immediately screamed career killer and was repeatedly shunted aside by this reporter in favor of things like out-of-control nanotechnology of the near future (which, you&#x2019;ll be delighted to hear, is something they&#x2019;re fairly concerned about at the Future of Humanity Institute). But as I tried every way I knew to find some <em>legitimate</em> half-truths about the future for you to read about on your flight to Dallas or wherever your loved ones live&#x2014;and I do suggest that you visit them soon, as in <em>this year,</em> I really do&#x2014;the problem became that people who make a profession of thinking seriously about the future won&#x2019;t really tell you anything that isn&#x2019;t cautious, hedged, and quadruple-qualified, because, as I came slowly to comprehend and deal with, <em>no one knows what&#x2019;s going to happen in the future.</em></p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.9"> My surprise at this pretty obvious-seeming realization showed me the extent to which, thanks to Hollywood or my own paranoia or whatever, I&#x2019;d unconsciously internalized a belief in the existence of some guy, some prematurely middle-aged guy, either Jewish or Asian (or, in the comedy version I sometimes screen internally, Irish), who sits in a room in the bowels of some governmental building and actually knows what&#x2019;s going to happen in the future, whose mutterings need to be heeded, whose moods must be tracked with concern if not alarm, and whose very existence is a cause all over the world of slight, constant anxiety, and properly so. Is this a dying spasm of the religion gene? Probably. All I know is that it came as a great liberation to me, having this creature expunged from my imagination, with his alert levels and his survival kits and all his total crap that he goes on about while with the left hand building nukes and starting wars. I reminded myself that incessant potential catastrophe is the human condition, is in fact the price of possessing consciousness, and I determined to live with greater ease from now on, and not to let anyone scare me about the future, because the truth is, the worst thing that could ever happen to you is death, and that&#x2019;s going to happen despite all your worry and effort, so it&#x2019;s simply irrational not to say fuck it. I&#x2019;m not saying start chain-smoking cloves and having unprotected sex with seaport trannie bar girls, though neither am I saying to abjure those things if they&#x2019;re what make you feel most alive. I&#x2019;m just saying, take courage. That and pretty much that alone is never the incorrect thing to do. And these thoughts were so edifying to me, and I really looked forward to sharing them with you, hoping they might lighten your load along the road.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.a"> Then I was introduced to a person called Marcus Livengood.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.b"> Good day, sunshine.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.d"> A question that lately has been getting knocked around a lot in the better biology departments is this: As we intrude on, clear-cut, burn, pollute, occupy, cause to become too hot or too dry, or otherwise render unsuitable to wildlife a larger and larger percentage of the planet, what will be involved in terms of the inevitable increased human exposure to remnant populations of truly wild fauna? Not for us but for them. What sort of changes, adaptations, and responses might we look for in the animals themselves as the pressures of this global-biological endgame begin to make themselves felt at the level of the individual organism? We have in mind here not microevolutionary changes to existing species but stress-related behavior modification, so-called &quot;phenotypic plasticity,&quot; the sort of thing we know numerous animal groups to be capable of, though it is rarely witnessed. Or <em>was</em> rarely witnessed. Now it seems to be cropping up everywhere, as even a casual viewer of nature shows can attest. Across numerous species and habitat types, we are seeing, in crudest terms, animals do things we haven&#x2019;t seen them do before.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.e"> I&#x2019;m tiptoeing around saying anything direct here because I feel what I hope is an understandable sheepishness in reporting on this subject at all, so sharply does it smack of quackery and gullibility; on top of that, it should be clear by now that I take no pleasure in freaking anyone out. What I can tell you is that this thing is real, that it has proved harder rather than easier for reasonable and informed people to deny, and that, however modest and obscure continues to be the small community of researchers and analysts and bloggers who have thus far commented on it and made the first steps toward charting its dimensions, you are going to be hearing a lot more about it in the next ten to twenty years. Even the Future of Humanity Institute is going to want to pay attention to this one, even though its origin lies rather far, academically speaking, from the stone paths of Oord.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.f"> Centerbrook, in southern Ohio, embodies a type of small-town college familiar to anyone who grew up or was educated in the Midwest. It started out in the nineteenth century as some sort of vocational academy, a normal school or a technical school, and accrued its university status over time, adding a department here or a professor there as qualified academics moved back from the Northeast to retire or take care of Mom, until one day all that was left was to stamp it a liberal-arts institution. No one ever got a good job just by saying they went there, but the students, on the days I visited, seemed sharp and ambitious. Many of them were a good decade past 1822. And although the campus isn&#x2019;t pretty&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all naked brick and parking lots&#x2014;there was an atmosphere of seriousness about what they were up to there.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.g"> Professor Marcus Livengood, who goes by Marc to the point of indulging &quot;Mr. Marc&quot; among his students, attended Centerbrook before getting his Ph.D. in comparative zoology at UC Santa Clara. He then took a job in the life-sciences department at his undergraduate alma mater. When I showed up forty minutes late for our appointment, he was alone in his surprisingly gigantic office. I&#x2019;ve never seen a person easier to describe physically. He looks like a young George Lucas. Same head shape, same beard, squint, everything, only taller and not pudgy yet and without the gray. Also, Mr. Livengood wears a ponytail. He wore, too, the heavy square glasses that all rogue scientists are commanded to wear when they are inducted into the Rogue Scientist Lodge. With what struck me as no mean feel for theater, as if we hadn&#x2019;t already been e-mailing for weeks, he said, &quot;So you&#x2019;re here to talk about the animals?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.h"> Whatever process led to this interview had begun about a year before. I fear I&#x2019;ll be trading away some much, much needed credibility by confessing this up front, but it began for me on the Internet. Not on kook sites, mind you; I didn&#x2019;t spend any time on the kook sites until a good bit later, until I got mid up with Marc, in fact. This was at AOL, American Online, which I, like many others, use to connect to the Internet every day and check my messages. One thing that happens when you connect via America Online is that this little list of news headlines pops up on the welcome page, and you can follow them to the relevant articles. You know this. Well, someone there in a pulsating cubicle on the company&#x2019;s editorial floor, a person entrusted with sifting through all the different wire reports from all over the planet and deciding what merited attention, started seeing something, a pattern. I wish there were a way to determine this person&#x2019;s identity (I&#x2019;ve tried), because these days I consider him or her a curious sort of brother or sister in arms. In any event, it seemed like every day, once a week at a minimum, there&#x2019;d be a far-out animal-attack story.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.i"> Not really that, though. An animal-attack story is a mountain lion pouncing on a jogger, a bear busting into someone&#x2019;s car, a surfer losing a leg. Granted, that sort of thing looks to be on the rise, too, in many parts of the world. But that&#x2019;s a story we know. Species self-protection + everybody loving the outdoors = occasional kills. We&#x2019;re talking here about stories having to do with changes in the <em>nature</em> and <em>lethality</em> of animal aggression. Solely in order to go ahead and escort an elephant out of the room here, let&#x2019;s just say it: We&#x2019;re talking about things like what happened to Steve Irwin.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.j"> Yes, the Irwin story has long since turned into a butt for bloggers&#x2019; macabre jokes. I won&#x2019;t make them myself: The man had a little girl, little Bindi. Indeed it was while filming scenes for <em>her</em> show that Irwin perished, a coincidence she&#x2019;s been mentioning on-air repeatedly ever since, for reasons best known to her. The fact remains that in the roughly 300 years during which human beings have been both <em>(a)</em> swimming, unknowingly or not, above giant stingrays in shallow water and <em>(b)</em> recording unusual things that happened to them in the ocean generally, there has been <em>not a single instance</em> of a stingray spiking someone to death in the heart, which is what happened to Irwin. The barbed end of the stingray&#x2019;s tail&#x2014;over which, I&#x2019;m told, rays have unholy power of control and accuracy; they kill tiny, tiny fish with it&#x2014;passed directly in between two of Irwin&#x2019;s ribs and into his left ventricle. He stood up, pulled it out, and died. There was video of this, but the Irwin family has destroyed it. In the weeks following, Australians began killing rays in the coastal waters. Police and beachcombers were finding mangled carcasses. But Michael Hornby, director of Irwin&#x2019;s Wildlife Warrior fund, issued a statement disavowing these acts and making clear that it would &quot;not accept and not stand for anyone who&#x2019;s taken a form of retribution&quot; on the rays.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.k"> Freaky things happen all the time in the world. I suppose everything has to happen for the first time at some point. Which is what one told oneself about the Irwin story. We&#x2019;d gone 300 years without an incident like this; if we could go 300 more, we&#x2019;d be all right. Clear snorkels, divers!</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.l"> We went six weeks. On October 19, 2006, in the waters off Boca Raton, Florida, a man named James Bertakis was boating with a family friend when a giant stingray leapt out of the water and into his lap. And it&#x2019;s important to visualize this correctly. Because it landed on his actual lap, with Bertakis in a sitting position, empty-handed&#x2014;he had no rod&#x2014;and the ray landed facing him, so they were eye to eye. This scene was described in some detail by the woman present. Bertakis and the ray were staring at each other, and it was flexing its tail. And then, bang. Up over its body and directly into the heart muscle, the heartflesh, inches deep. Reporters immediately asked the internationally regarded marine biologists at the University in Miami if there could be any connection, but Dr. Bob Cowen, the researcher put forward as spokesperson by the department, responded that he could &quot;not imagine any connection&quot; and that the attacks were &quot;just two really unusual situations.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.m"> &quot;Except not,&quot; said Livengood.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.n"> We were sitting now, and I&#x2019;d just read off that quotation, along with several others, in order to suggest&#x2014;politely, I hoped&#x2014;that the position held by those in his profession who might be called <em>mainstream</em> is that what seems like a change in global animal behavior is really just an increase in media attention, or a string of coincidences that get stitched together on the Internet, or most charitably, an increase in the exposure of individual human beings to undomesticated animals as our habitats expand and the animals become more desperate for food sources, more willing to venture out.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.o"> &quot;What do you mean, &#x2019;Except not&#x2019;?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.p"> &quot;Except they weren&#x2019;t unusual.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.q"> I assumed he meant there&#x2019;d been other barb-to-heart ray attacks and asked if he&#x2019;d be willing to share the data with me.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.r"> &quot;Rays? No,&quot; he said. &quot;Or at least those are the only two we&#x2019;ve seen. But everything else...&quot; He looked up into the corner with his head tilted as if I&#x2019;d told him to pose for a picture that way. Then he popped to his feet.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.s"> &quot;You want to see <em>our</em> file?&quot; he asked. He&#x2019;d gone over to another, larger computer in the corner of his office and was messing around on it.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.t"> I&#x2019;d already shown him my file, when we first sat down. Mine was in a manila folder. It contained cutouts and printouts of all the articles I&#x2019;d archived in the preceding year. Most of them I&#x2019;d e-mailed first to friends with little jokey subject headers along the lines of <em>gird thyself.</em> It was one of the lucky recipients who replied, after the thirtieth or fortieth message, &quot;Did you know there&#x2019;s actually a guy who believes this is happening?&quot; When I wrote back saying, &quot;Yes: myself,&quot; he sent another message, saying, &quot;Right, but this guy studies animals.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.u"> When I proffered my folder, he actually loudly laughed and said, &quot;That&#x2019;s what we get in a week, since people found out about us.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.v"> I won&#x2019;t play dumb with you. I already knew at this point that by &quot;us&quot; he meant not him and his colleagues but him and a bunch of isolated obsessives&#x2014;bloggers and amateur naturalists and sci-fi people dizzy with their first taste of contrarian legitimacy and also, I suppose, people like me who become helplessly fixated for no honorable reason on cabalistic patterns in the news. This &quot;us,&quot; if it&#x2019;s even an &quot;us,&quot; doesn&#x2019;t have a good acronym yet and hasn&#x2019;t given any papers at conferences or generated much of a media profile at all, really, apart from a few stray &quot;opposing point of view&quot; quotes in wire-service articles like the ones I&#x2019;d gathered.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.w"> &quot;Check this out,&quot; Livengood said, sliding his chair to the side to make room for me. On the screen was a large parti-color map of the world, in a circular shape like an old navigational map. The landmasses and coastlines were thickly riddled with tiny black dots, about pencil-tip size. There were maybe twenty stray black dots on the open seas. Livengood said&#x2014;breezily, like someone giving an office tour to the new guy&#x2014;&quot;Those are all confirmed, and those are all in the past six years.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.x"> &quot;What are they, exactly?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.y"> &quot;Start clicking on them.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.z"> I sat there for at least half an hour. At one point, he got up and went off down the hall. It was true that the sheaf of articles I&#x2019;d been so proud of was a Cracker Jack flip-book in comparison with what Livengood had collected. I should say that for an item to make his list, it must stand up to the admittedly soft but at least not nonexistent test of being <em>(a)</em> not a hoax&#x2014;that is, independently verifiable <em>as an incident</em> through follow-up research&#x2014;and <em>(b)</em> not the result of some obvious confusion. I invite you to verify these things as well, through Google or LexisNexis or in a few cases an article in <em>Animal Behavior Abstracts</em> (a complete set of which sat on the shelves behind Livengood&#x2019;s desk); you won&#x2019;t find them in the <em>Weekly World News,</em> either, but on the BBC Web site, the AP, <em>Science,</em> and <em>Nature,</em> places that have a vested interest in not getting fooled. Anyway, I assure you I don&#x2019;t know enough about even the normal goings-on in the animal kingdom to fabricate this many anomalies.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.10"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a03a035f1c7af15a1eff64/master/w_806/violence-of-the-lambs-02.jpg" alt="violence-of-the-lambs-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-jeremiah-sullivan-violence-lambs-future-human-race&amp;t=violence-of-the-lambs-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-jeremiah-sullivan-violence-lambs-future-human-race&amp;t=violence-of-the-lambs-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-jeremiah-sullivan-violence-lambs-future-human-race&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a03a035f1c7af15a1eff64%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fviolence-of-the-lambs-02.jpg&amp;description=violence-of-the-lambs-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-jeremiah-sullivan-violence-lambs-future-human-race&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a03a035f1c7af15a1eff64%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fviolence-of-the-lambs-02.jpg&amp;description=violence-of-the-lambs-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.11"> Soon I figured out that some of the little dots, when you clicked on them, led to multiple incidents, signifying vectors of activity, usually but not always confined to a single species. There are four small English seaport towns, for instance, where various seabirds have started targeting people. A swan came out of the water there and took a dog under. Indeed, when measured in actual numbers, birds may be the single most active species in terms of manifesting whatever lies underneath this shift. In Boston, for the past few years, there&#x2019;s been what can only be called an ongoing siege of wild turkeys. Children and old people getting attacked. In Sonoma County, California, the chicken population not long ago carried out &quot;a flurry of attacks on neighborhood children.&quot; The mother of one of the victims told a reporter, &quot;It&#x2019;s not charming when you have to see your baby attacked...seeing the blood going down his face and seeing him screaming.... I can&#x2019;t sleep at night.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.12"> A fair share of the new violence is animal-on-animal. Needless to say, it garners less attention in the media. In the Polish village of Stubienko, in June of 2000 (one of the earlier blips in Livengood&#x2019;s collection), the storks went crazy and started slaughtering chickens, hundreds of them. (There were, I&#x2019;m noticing only now, additional reports of &quot;sporadic attacks on humans&quot; at the time.) Observers were &quot;at a loss to explain the aberrant behavior.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.13"> You see what I mean about there being something <em>off</em> in these stories. The storks started slaughtering the chickens.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.14"> In reality much of the intra-animal violence seems to suggest sheer madness. Chimps have repeatedly been documented engaging in &quot;rape, wife beating, murder, and infanticide.&quot; Elephants on the African savanna have been raping rhinoceroses, something that evidently is just as startling to science as it to the layperson.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.15"> If you&#x2019;ve paid attention to one particular facet of this story as it&#x2019;s unfolded, you&#x2019;re likely to have read about the work of Gay Bradshaw, a psychologist and environmental scientist who&#x2019;s been tracking the accelerated mental degeneration of elephant populations in severely destabilized areas of Africa and Asia. She&#x2019;s an extremely well-regarded researcher whose work is adding up to maybe the most persuasive proof yet mounted that the psychological overlap between our psyches and those of the more developed animals has been massively underestimated when it comes to affection, suffering, stress, and we don&#x2019;t even know what areas. That&#x2019;s how I understand her work, at any rate. Earlier this year, a major magazine brought her to national attention, and she has a book deal, and to get to the point, she declined an interview, for which I blame her not even slightly; if I were an internationally respected animal scientist, I&#x2019;d drive cold muddy hours out of my way to avoid even a tangential meeting with Marc Livengood (not that I don&#x2019;t personally find him heroic). Nonetheless there is perhaps more of a kinship between their respective working theses than either would leap to admit. (Livengood regards Bradshaw with a bit of jealousy and eye rolling, I am sure you&#x2019;ll be shocked to learn.)</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.16"> In any case, Bradshaw&#x2019;s interests wouldn&#x2019;t lead her necessarily to be concerned with the animal-on-human part of the elephant breakdown&#x2014;nonetheless, they are killing us, too, in numbers never imagined. More than a thousand victims in under a decade. Forty-four Nigerian communities &quot;erased&quot; by rampaging elephants in a single migratory season. Some of the incidents have been quite spectacular, with multiple animals working in concert (as opposed to isolated or &quot;rogue&quot; males, which frequently act up); they&#x2019;re storming through neighborhoods, turning on crowds. If you&#x2019;ve ever seen an elephant attack a human being, it&#x2019;s very personal looking anyway. They keep going after you when you&#x2019;re down. At least at first, you&#x2019;re conscious while they basically knock the bejeezus out of you with their trunks and then stomp you into the earth. In one place, the animals first rampaged, clearing the town, then broke into unprotected casks of locally brewed rice beer, then hurled themselves against electrified fences and died. Bradshaw writes that &quot;some biologists think that increased elephant aggression might comprise, in part, revenge against humans for accidental or deliberate elephant deaths.&quot; Not to be outdone, &quot;angry villagers&quot; are poisoning to death an average of twenty elephants each year, according to <em>The New York Times</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.17"> Indeed, as suggested by the tortured-ray carcasses that washed up in the wake of the Irwin killing, swift acts of human retaliation have not infrequently followed the more dramatic of the late attacks. In Salt Springs, Florida, where gators went berserk a year and a half ago and killed three women in a week, the citizens &quot;declared war on alligators.&quot; That&#x2019;s how one busy trapper described it. &quot;People are really going crazy,&quot; he said.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.18"> In other cases, cooler heads have prevailed and more peaceful measures have been pursued. One example: In Bombay, earlier this year, a pack of leopards entered the town&#x2014;just sauntered out of the forest at the heart of that city&#x2014;and murdered a total of twenty-two people. J. C. Daniel, an environmentalist who has monitored the wildlife in that forest for forty years, said, &quot;We have to study why the animal is coming out. It never came out before.&quot; But the people responded creatively. In hopes of calming the beasts&#x2014;and with a gesture having weird overtones of the sacrificial offering to assuage angry cat gods&#x2014;officials in the area are releasing hundreds and hundreds of little pigs and rabbits into the forest. (2 Kings 17:25: &quot;And when they began to dwell there, they feared not the Lord: and the Lord sent lions among them, which killed them.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.19"> In China it&#x2019;s the pets that are changing. The AP reported that &quot;about 90,000 people in Beijing have been attacked by dogs and cats in the first six months of this year, up almost 34 percent for the same period last year, the government said.&quot; In America, where animals have perhaps a freer recourse to weapons, at least four people have been shot by their dogs in the past two years. One incident involved a stun gun. One reportedly took place while the animal was being beaten, its owner hoped, to death. That killing, then, could truly be described as self-defense. (In a third incident, in Memphis, a dog shot its owner in the back while the man was arguing with his girlfriend&#x2014;this one may have been accidental.)</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> A pack of 200 dogs descended out of the mountains&#x2014;this was in Albania&#x2014;ran straight into the middle of the town of Mamurras, and just started going after people&#x2014;old people, young people, &quot;dragging them to the ground and inflicting serious wounds.&quot; One witness spoke of a &quot;clearly identifiable leader.&quot; (Lest we assume this to be a seasonal occurrence in Albania, the town&#x2019;s mayor, Anton Frroku, stated that &quot;even in the movies, I have never seen a horde of 200 stray dogs from the mountains attacking people in the middle of a town.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> &quot;Clearly identifiable leader&quot;: Elsewhere, too, there are suggestions of organization, cooperation. In India one of the country&#x2019;s busiest highways has been repeatedly taken over and brought to a standstill by what the BBC has described as &quot;troops&quot; of &quot;monkey raiders,&quot; 2,000 at a time. &quot;We have already seen that new troops have entered the area in recent weeks,&quot; a local official tells the BBC. There was talk of &quot;relocating&quot; them. In Britain, where the rat population has increased by 40 percent in the last decade, and old people are saying they haven&#x2019;t seen anything like it since the Blitz, scientists have pinned the otherwise inexplicable surge on the fact that the rats &quot;have been learning from other rats how to avoid the poisons.&quot; Again, look at these numbers. We&#x2019;re seeing increases not of 4 or 5 percent but on the order of 40, <em>50 percent.</em></p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> In at least one situation, clearly discernible technological innovation has entered the picture. A community of chimpanzees living on the edges of the savanna in Senegal have learned to fashion and use spears, which they sharpen with their teeth. These are chimps we&#x2019;ve been observing for 200 years; they have never used spears. Now they&#x2019;ve begun spiking little bush babies with them. The bush babies hide in hollow trees. The chimps do a sort of frog-gigging number on them and pull them out like fondue. Within a year of the first chimp having been observed using a weapon this way, nine others had caught on and were recorded doing it in a total of twenty-two observed instances, suggesting that at least at the simian level these fairly radical behavioral changes are taking place within the span of a single generation.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> The science behind all this is, you might say, disturbingly fundamental. As the planet warms, evolution speeds. We&#x2019;ve known this for a long time. You learn it in college biology. Things evolve faster nearer the equator. Heat speeds up molecular activity. You have a population of squid&#x2014;it divides. One branch hangs out up by Alaska, the other goes down to the coast of Peru. Go and visit them 50,000 years later. The group up by Alaska is slowly subdividing into two species. The one down by Peru has turned into twenty-six species and is no longer even recognizable. Well, these days the whole planet is experiencing that effect. More heat, more light. The animals are doing things differently; they&#x2019;re showing up places they&#x2019;re not supposed to go, sleeping at different times, eating different things. Talk with any fieldworker and it&#x2019;s a truism that the guidebooks are becoming obsolete at ten times the speed. As a researcher told the BBC in 2001, &quot;There is a genetic change in their response to daylight. We can detect this change over as short a time period as five years. Evolution is happening and it is happening very fast.&quot; And he was only talking about a particular species of mosquito. Dr. Christina Holzapfel, at the University of Oregon in Eugene, has been watching changes among Canadian red squirrels. &quot;Phenotypic plasticity is not the whole story,&quot; she told <em>Science</em>magazine last year. &quot;Studies show,&quot; another source quoted her as saying, &quot;that over the past several decades, rapid climate change has led to heritable, genetic changes in animal populations.&quot; Most recently a piece in <em>Smithsonian</em> stated that &quot;lately there has been evidence that plants and animals are changing much faster.&quot; What this means is that we picked a bad time to have all of the animals enraged at us, since just at the moment when their disposition might be expected to turn, they happen to be evolving like crazy.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> What stuck out above all else, as I clicked through Livengood&#x2019;s dots, was the same tendency that had presented itself when I was still just idly following news items on the Internet, namely, the extraordinary number of &quot;first time&quot; attacks.

Marc referred to them as &quot;the battle site&quot; and &quot;the kill site.&quot; He&#x2019;d arranged for us to be met by a tall, extraordinarily upright young woman from Dakar named Sila Fall. Her hair was in braids, and she wore all white with a blue bandanna around her neck. She was the UNICEF liaison for this district. She took us down a road to a village; it looked more like a camp. But the people here were healthy. UNICEF was overseeing the digging of a new well. They asked us to sit and watch a sort of play, performed in Kikamba. I could just make out the plot. One man was sick; he was the patient; another man came, the healer. They spoke to each other&#x2014;that ancient bond. They danced.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.1z"> We walked behind Sila Fall, who walked very fast.

The school. &quot;In 2000 it was not like this,&quot; she said. &quot;In 2000, if it didn&#x2019;t get thrown from the back of an army truck, we didn&#x2019;t have it.

Sila Fall spoke to her in Kikamba, she spoke to Sila Fall in Kikamba, then Sila Fall said to Marc, &quot;She says that she welcomes you, she...knows who you are, and she will show you the place that you want to know about.&quot; This, then, was Kakenya Wamboi, or as Marc called her in e-mails to me, &quot;the veteran.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.21"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a03a03dab0df6312e26ab5/master/w_806/violence-of-the-lambs-03.jpg" alt="violence-of-the-lambs-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-jeremiah-sullivan-violence-lambs-future-human-race&amp;t=violence-of-the-lambs-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-jeremiah-sullivan-violence-lambs-future-human-race&amp;t=violence-of-the-lambs-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-jeremiah-sullivan-violence-lambs-future-human-race&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a03a03dab0df6312e26ab5%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fviolence-of-the-lambs-03.jpg&amp;description=violence-of-the-lambs-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-jeremiah-sullivan-violence-lambs-future-human-race&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a03a03dab0df6312e26ab5%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fviolence-of-the-lambs-03.jpg&amp;description=violence-of-the-lambs-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.22"> It&#x2019;s known that in the spring of 2000, when the drought conditions were at their worst in this district, there occurred a two-hour pitched battle between monkeys and human beings over access to three newly arrived water tankers. As the four of us walked beyond the narrow outskirts of the village, about 200 yards down a truly ovenishly hot road, Kakenya Wamboi, who participated in that event, was speaking through Sila Fall, answering Marc&#x2019;s extremely precise, obviously rehearsed questions, telling Marc and me the story of the fight, how the human beings had rushed to draw water from the tankers, yet within seconds an entire troop of monkeys had appeared. They ranged themselves along the edges of the tankers. Others came from across the road. &quot;They bit us and clawed at us. They threw stones at us from the top of the truck. My husband is dead, but until he died he had a mark on his forehead from where one of the stones cracked his skull. You don&#x2019;t know how strong they are! They struck ten people. Badly enough that we all ran off. The men went back with as. The monkeys were drinking all of the water. My husband said that they could work the valves. The drivers were still in the trucks. They were scared. The men went at the monkeys with as and had to kill eight of them before the rest ran off. The drivers would not stay in this village overnight as they usually do, so we had to draw all the water off in a rush; we didn&#x2019;t get it all before they started the trucks again. Some of what we got was in bad containers and spoiled, and the monkeys had already taken about a third of it. Of the people that died in that famine, the most of them died that spring, and my husband always said the monkeys killed them, that the monkeys won that battle.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.23"> She made the gesture of, I suppose, a monkey swinging an ax in victory.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.24"> At some point, Sila Fall interrupted her and said that we needed to go, because to reach the other place Marc wanted to see, we had to drive two hours, and we didn&#x2019;t want to be on that road after dark; it skirted the Somali border&#x2014;he made a machine-gun sign&#x2014;so we needed to say good-bye. Did Marc have any more questions?</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.25"> &quot;What sort of calls were they doing during the attack? What sounds were they making? Or weren&#x2019;t they making sounds?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.26"> Kakenya Wamboi said that they were chattering the entire time. Not screaming. More like talking. Then she said something else. Sila Fall said, &quot;She says that she is glad to meet you and help you and that you see that she is very poor, you see her house, and she knows you are good people, and that she hopes you will help her.&quot; To his credit, Marc looked at me.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.27"> Knowing Marc Livengood a little now, you may appreciate the profundity of the Livengood silence during this car ride with Sila Fall. The man was seeing, I&#x2019;m sure, indescribable things. Sila Fall drove and talked, mostly about a period of years she spent in the United States. I was dying to ask her if she knew why Livengood was here or what it was that Livengood believed, but could neither do this in front of Marc nor figure a way to get them apart. Finally, the van swerved and slowed and through the seat we could feel the tires meeting the sudden resistance of sand. We got out and started to walk. I asked Sila Fall, &quot;Have you seen this place?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.28"> She nodded. &quot;I grew up here.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.29"> We walked for twenty minutes through a gap in a low sandstone formation. We came to what must have been the remnant of a sinkhole, a cavity in the earth the shape of an upside-down yarn cone. At the bottom was a pool of water. &quot;Healthy water,&quot; Sila Fall said. There was one spot along the rim of the hole where you could slide and clamber down. &quot;I wasn&#x2019;t here in 2000,&quot; Sila Fall said, &quot;but if it was as dry as they say, there was only a puddle down there. It was probably the only water for miles.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2a"> In late February of that year, a herder named Ali Adam Hussein slid down to that puddle, probably not to slake his own thirst but to gather a little water for his cows. He looked up and saw several monkeys looking down at him. Presumably, he went to go for his weapon. The monkeys responded by lifting several stones and hurling them directly at his head. He died hours later of what a nurse back in Mandera, where we&#x2019;d just come from, described simply as &quot;severe head injuries.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2b"> Marc did not ask Sila Fall&#x2019;s permission before he himself skidded down into the deep natural watering hole. Both Sila Fall and I watched him, somewhat stunned. He seemed to have acted on a sudden impulse. At the bottom, however, he immediately displayed purpose. He stood with his hip cocked, his ponytail jutting out through the back of his khaki Centerbrook University cap, grinning up at me through his beard. I said, &quot;Tell me what you&#x2019;re thinking.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2c"> &quot;I&#x2019;m standing where he stood, John.&quot; Marc Livengood is a man who likes to say your name at the end of sentences when he talks to you.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2d"> &quot;And what does that mean?&quot; I said. (These were not real questions; he just sometimes liked to force me to go through the whole production of baiting him, and I&#x2019;d adjusted to it.)</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2e"> &quot;What does it mean?&quot; he said. &quot;It means I&#x2019;m standing where the First Victim stood.&quot; He said the two words in such a way that I feel I have to capitalize the first letters of each. &quot;It means we are all three standing on the site of an incident unknown to the annals of natural science, and it is unstudied. We met the First Veteran and the First Victim today; you tell <em>me</em> what that means.&quot; Then he took pictures for forty-five minutes.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2f"> Finally able to converse with Sila Fall somewhat normally, I asked her, &quot;Do you know why he&#x2019;s here?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2g"> &quot;He&#x2019;s a scientist,&quot; she said.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2h"> &quot;Specifically, I mean? You don&#x2019;t? Specifically, he believes that the animals are turning on us, that we&#x2019;re about to experience a war of animals on human beings, and that it&#x2019;s going to begin here. That it may already have begun here.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2i"> &quot;Do you believe that?&quot; she asked.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2j"> &quot;I don&#x2019;t think so,&quot; I said. I didn&#x2019;t know how to tell her that she didn&#x2019;t need to be polite with me. She was there in a professional capacity. I suppose I was, too, in some deformed way. Really, it was stupid of me to be accosting her. But I&#x2019;d been listening to Marc nonstop since we&#x2019;d left the airport in Nairobi, and she seemed very adjusted.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2k"> &quot;Most people would probably think he&#x2019;s insane,&quot; I said.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2l"> Sila Fall shrugged her shoulders. &quot;It&#x2019;s possible,&quot; she said.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2m"> &quot;Possible that he&#x2019;s insane or that there&#x2019;s about to be an animal-human war?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2n"> She shrugged her shoulders again.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2o"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2p"> The story runs into an obstacle here, because shortly after we arrived back in the States, Marc Livengood was fired from Centerbrook. Neither he nor anybody at the school will talk about it except to confirm that he&#x2019;s suing. From someone in the town who shall remain unidentified, I learned that he&#x2019;s living with his father, a retired engineer, in Dayton, or was as of two months before. The one time I got him to return a phone call and was able to ask him what had happened, he replied, in an almost boastful tone, &quot;John, when the story of this comes out, you, you...Let&#x2019;s just say Marc Livengood is not going to be what&#x2019;s disgraced by this, okay?&quot; He refused to clarify that and hung up within maybe half a minute, sounding disgusted. A guy in the tech department at the school, whom I called in a Hail Mary way, told me he&#x2019;d heard his boss talking about it on the telephone and that it was all &quot;computer-related.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2q"> Needless to say, it&#x2019;s been challenging, with Livengood underground, to push things forward. I couldn&#x2019;t get anybody else in the field to say anything about him, because nobody really knows anything about him; it had always just been an Internet thing. Even his colleagues at the school thought he was involved, as his chair put it to me, in &quot;a kind of curatorial project.&quot; He&#x2019;d once been the subject of a profile in a magazine called<em>Varmint Masters,</em> published out of Birmingham, Alabama. Once more, I invite you to research this. It&#x2019;s a real magazine. And these people have radically redefined the definition of the word <em>varmint</em>. They hunt camels, moose, things like that. Reading it, I get the sense that now and then some country, like Australia, will have a problem with an out-of-control population of some feral species and that these VMs will travel from the four corners with their bunker-busting rifles and such. But I haven&#x2019;t been able to find a copy of the Livengood issue, even on eBay, and cannot find contact info for the publisher in Birmingham. Is it possible that Livengood felt some sort of kinship with this subpopulation of men who work to become ever more expert hunters of animals not normally thought of as prey? Now there was no one to answer these questions. I found one guy, a marine biologist at a university on the West Coast&#x2014;he asked me to name neither him nor the school&#x2014;who remembered Livengood from a conference. He said, &quot;I actually thought some of what he was talking about was pretty interesting, but back then it was just about predatory patterns, dietary disturbances. It sounds like maybe he had some kind of crack-up or something. I mean, I&#x2019;m hearing about it from you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2r"> And I was hearing about it from Livengood. We were all supposed to hear it from him and maybe will yet. That&#x2019;s the future, which, as I think we&#x2019;ve established, is fairly sketchy terrain to prance out onto without a sure hand to guide you. I present this essay, with its mere sliver of the material Livengood had gathered, with its shadow of an approximation of the boldness of thought he brought to bear on it, as a testament. I think about him every time I see another animal story in the news. The cat at the nursing home in Rhode Island that was able to predict which patients were about to die and would sit on their beds until they&#x2019;d expired? Marc Livengood had thoughts on that, be assured. And has them still.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2s"> Pet loyalty, in fact, was a recurrent subject of his monologue on our last night together in Nairobi. Which eons of their training would prove genetically more persuasive when, for instance, the dogs were asked by the wolves to choose? Us or them, that&#x2019;s what it would come down to. Would they turn on us or defend us?</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2t"> That night, we sat at an uncomfortably tiny table at an open-air place about a mile from the airport. He talked. I drank, my pencil-hand flying. He spoke of how it would go, how it would really begin, stopping after every third or fourth sentence to hold up his hands in a &quot;stop&quot; gesture and say, &quot;Speculation! Speculation!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2u"> He conjured up one of the eeriest Armageddons I have ever heard described: existence on a planet that has<em>itself</em> become treacherous. A rapidly approaching period of uncertainty and terror, waves of increased attacks from all over the earth, creatures coming up from the deep oceans to paralyze shipping, possibly at the sonic command of the dolphins. The forests will no longer be a place to camp. Troops of wildcats, deer, and moose. Ever seen hikers get stomped by a moose? It&#x2019;s like watching cans go through a can cruncher.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2v"> For a while, everyone will cling to the hope that it&#x2019;s some kind of phase, and all sorts of comforting theories will be peddled: sunspots, magnetism in the earth&#x2019;s core, a different explanation every week, but always something to suggest that &quot;the power will come back on,&quot; as Livengood liked to say.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2w"> &quot;You have to understand,&quot; he told me, &quot;these are normal biological systems functioning. We <em>are</em> a threat to the animals. They&#x2019;re just doing what nature has designed them to do. In this sense, there&#x2019;s nothing revolutionary at all about what I&#x2019;m arguing. You could even say there&#x2019;s nothing new about my work. Where it gets interesting is when you remember that we&#x2019;re a different kind of threat, right? We&#x2019;re presenting them with the prospect of more or less total global domination by a single species. The lower orders haven&#x2019;t seen this since the dinosaurs. And keep in mind they were undergoing a period of accelerated evolution, too. We always make it that the dinosaurs died, then mammals came forward. Why not at least entertain the idea that the mammals took over?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2x"> We were quiet for a minute, sipping our tea.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2y"> &quot;And keep in mind,&quot; Marc continued, &quot;that there may be at this moment something like forty dolphins living in the open seas, escapees from marine defense programs. We don&#x2019;t know what they&#x2019;re trained to do. Carry explosives? Kill divers? I&#x2019;m looking for them to emerge in some sort of overt leadership capacity before 2010. It&#x2019;s the chimps on land and the dolphins in the seas. We can assume that they are working out some sort of mutually intelligible signal system now, probably on the West African coast.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.2z"> I asked him about the whole interspecies-cooperation thing, which has always and to some degree still does strike me as sheer sci-fi.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.30"> &quot;Do you know Kropotkin&#x2019;s <em>Mutual Aid</em>?&quot; he asked, and then, when he saw my blank look, added, &quot;Read it. The book&#x2019;s been out of print for probably a hundred years, but you should read it. He documented hundreds of instances of this&#x2014;separate species helping one another. Kropotkin&#x2019;s finding was if two or more species are exposed to a shared threat, we will also see shared defense. The only question concerns the mechanism.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.31"> &quot;What&#x2019;s it all going to look like?&quot; This was my question.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.32"> &quot;Unrecognizable,&quot; he said. &quot;People moving about in packs. Depopulation. We don&#x2019;t know how far down the chain this realignment of animal consciousness is going to travel, for precisely the reason that we don&#x2019;t how far down consciousness penetrates. The insects&#x2014;will they be involved? The rodent classes? The reptiles? You&#x2019;re just making armchair guesses at that point.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.33"> I asked him which animal he was most worried about.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.34"> &quot;That&#x2019;s hard,&quot; he answered. &quot;I think about the dolphins, not because of their lethality&#x2014;though it&#x2019;s underestimated constantly&#x2014;but because I think they understand best, of all the species, what damage we&#x2019;ve done to the planet. They get the immensity of it. The other animals are responding to sudden infusions of hormones and little instinct triggers, but I believe that the dolphins are capable of hatred and that their hatred of us is essentially bottomless.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.35"> &quot;Then, if you&#x2019;re talking scariest land animal to me, you might want to list the bear. Or rather, a combined chimp-and-bear onslaught, with a sort of Master Blaster power dynamic between chimps and bears. My God, bears can mess you up when they have a mind. Takes ten shots to stop one, routinely. Of course, by then we&#x2019;ll be firing on them with bazookas and whatnot. Hunting codes will be off. Still, fighting them is going to be the closest thing to fighting a human army. I fear the bears. Definitely. They know how to get into houses and cars. A species-wide rampage will be just... Fuck, man, part of keeping going in a professional capacity for me is keeping my mind off of stuff like that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.36"> He adjusted his glasses and looked around.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.37"> &quot;Think about it like this,&quot; he said. &quot;In the early eighteenth century, there were massive combined populations of enslaved blacks, embattled Indians, and poor-white servants living in North America. If at any moment they had truly woken up to the nature of their plight, which is to say the <em>commonality</em> of their plight, and identified its cause as the agenda of the Colonial ruling class, ours would not now be a mainly European continent, genetically speaking. The animals are making the same discovery about themselves. And I don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;ll squander it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.38"> &quot;So you would say bears are scarier than dolphins in the end?&quot; I asked him.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.39"> &quot;You want scari<em>est?</em>&quot; he said. &quot;Scariest is not the animals we know about. It&#x2019;s the animals we don&#x2019;t know about. Have you ever seen the statistics on estimated unknown species globally? We don&#x2019;t know half the crap that&#x2019;s alive on this planet, John. And I mean down at the very bottom of the ocean, in the Marianas Trench...that&#x2019;s an undiscovered planet, in terms of what&#x2019;s down there. And who knows what size those animals are, what they&#x2019;re capable of? Well, the animals may know. They may know what&#x2019;s down there, and they may know how to communicate with it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.3a"> Have fear: That&#x2019;s what Marc Livengood taught me. What he teaches us. And if I&#x2019;ve in any way satisfied the expectations of this assignment, it&#x2019;s in coming away with that drop of distilled realism: You want to know what to be afraid of in the next fifty years? Everything. Everything that walks and crawls. Everything that moves. Because it hates us. &quot;Why do they hate us?&quot; Remember that? How quaint it already seems, when you think we were so recently asking that question about one another! And yet maybe the answers are the same; maybe we can apply the lessons of the one to the other. They hate us because they can&#x2019;t <em>be</em> us. Can&#x2019;t have our thumbs, our brains, our music, our beautiful flowing hair. Can&#x2019;t have it can&#x2019;t have it can&#x2019;t have it. And right now, sure, I say that I feel bad about that. But in the moment, in the moment when I&#x2019;m letting explosive tracer rounds erupt from the mouth of my firemaker, just hosing metal right into the faces of a bunch of screaming giant eagles as they come for my daughter&#x2014;and my cats, who will never betray me, not ever, or who <em>have</em> betrayed me and are scratching the dook out of my back while I struggle to aim&#x2014;will I be thinking, &quot;Ah, too bad, wish we hadn&#x2019;t fucked you like that&quot;? Don&#x2019;t kid yourselves.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.3b"> We gave them so much. That&#x2019;s what gets me. What did they have before us? What did they do? We gave them jobs, we put them on television, we cried for their losses. It seems their idea of repayment is the tooth and the claw. I don&#x2019;t think we need them. Everything we need we can make from corn.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.3c"> Not that I don&#x2019;t hold out hope. If you and I are here in a half century, I hope we&#x2019;ll be celebrating the end of this war. I hope we&#x2019;ll be telling with highest zest, again and again till our great-grandchildren are sick of it, the story of the day of the accord, when we knew it was over. Of little Bindi Irwin, a woman now, wind in her face, her beauty still touched by a bit of <em>Mad Max</em> dog-boy ferality, as she was escorted out through the waves between white flags to a meeting with Dolphin Leader, where they brokered a d&#xE9;tente in the chirpy language Steve had just finished teaching her when he got spiked. We, for our part, will have promised to live in greater harmony with Gaia.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.3d"> But I&#x2019;m not sure we&#x2019;ll ever say the world is ours again, not sure we&#x2019;ll ever really feel at home here again. That may be for the best. Being brave means saying, in every situation, &quot;I&#x2019;ll comport myself as I think honorable, no matter the risk and no matter what the voice of frowning power has to say about it.&quot; That&#x2019;s the kind of thinking that&#x2019;ll get you raped by a rhino.</p><p data-reactid=".ixovmoi328.1.1.0.0.4.3e"> Takeaway message? Let&#x2019;s get proactive. Starting with a subscription to <em>Varmint Masters.</em> We&#x2019;ve been working with this settled-agriculture shit over 10,000 years. What it&#x2019;s gotten us is a poisoned planet and a bunch of furious, mentally retarded beings with teeth and claws and tusks and tentacles and retractable poisoned darts and venom that they can spit and noses so strong they lift tanks and on and on and on, and what do we have? What were we given in this fight? Fucking thumbs. Fucking opposable thumbs. That&#x2019;s pretty weak, I&#x2019;m sorry. But guess what?
