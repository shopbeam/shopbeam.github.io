No longer are carrots, beets, and cauliflower mere accessories, fated to sit humbly alongside whatever noble proteins are being honored by the chef. At Dirt Candy, a vegetable restaurant in New York, Amanda Cohen tempts unbelievers with an irresistible starter, much as the wicked witch captivated Hansel and Gretel with that gingerbread house.\u000A\u000A Almost all customers begin their meal with jalape&amp;#xF1;o hush puppies—hot, crunchy, spicy, and sweet on the inside. A side of maple butter adds to the bliss. When I last ate there, the hush puppies were soon surpassed by re-imagined onion pancakes, soft and puffy; fried cabbage jalape on a kohlrabi-noodle salad; and most astonishing of all, parsnip pillows on grilled watermelon radish. The parsnips in fact constituted new-style gnocchi, more alluring than the traditional Italian kind.\u000A\u000A \u0022What you\u0027re eating,\u0022 Cohen said to me after that meal, \u0022are not luxury ingredients. My vegetables come in bags. This is not Per Se, where every vegetable is beautiful and comes from someplace else. The carrots I serve here are just carrots.\u0022\u000A\u000A But of course, they are not. We are entering a time of equalopportunity eating—vegetables have achieved parity with meat and fish, inconceivable throughout most of my lifetime. They have taken their place at the center of the plate.\u000A\u000A Until recently, few chefs had come close to unlocking the genetic code for transforming vegetables into satisfying main courses. Those who tried were considered freakish, like the alchemists who tried to change lead into gold. Finally, Cohen and other chefs have created the soul-satisfying entrée that is not a half pound of beef. \u0022Vegetables,\u0022 she says, \u0022are the Wild West of cooking.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A My generation possessed deeply personal thoughts about vegetables. We disliked them, each of us in our own way. It\u0027s not that we didn\u0027t eat them. We consumed multiple servings of McDonald\u0027s fries.\u000A\u000A I grew up not caring if I ever saw another salad. Only twice do I recall an uncooked vegetable astounding me. One was organic asparagus served at the restaurant Sean\u0027s Panaroma in Australia, the other a Mokum carrot plucked from the earth at Blue Hill at Stone Barns.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Five Dishes That Will Make You Forget About Beef\u000A\u000A 1. Salt-Roasted Golden Beets, Vedge, Philadelphia\u000A\u000A Beets below, beets above. The beets go on....\u000A\u000A 2. Watercress Soup, Joe Beef, Montreal\u000A\u000A Soup prepared with ham broth topped with toast, aioli, and sautéed escargots.\u000A\u000A 3. Eggplant Parmigiana, Lincoln, Manhattan; and Leo\u0027s Latticini, Queens\u000A\u000A At Lincoln, Chef Jonathan Benno\u0027s version is almost home cooking. At Leo\u0027s Latticini, Marie DeBenedittis prepares hers non-gooey but still cheesy.\u000A\u000A 4. Agnolotti, Spago, Los Angeles\u000A\u000A Wolfgang Puck\u0027s ravioli-like packets are stuffed with chestnut puree and mascarpone cheese.\u000A\u000A 5. Black-Cabbage Galette, Dovetail, Manhattan\u000A\u000A John Fraser\u0027s galette is brilliantly buttery, and his cabbage straight from paradise.\u000A\u000A When all right-thinking people insisted that vegetables be organic or heirloom, I remained unmoved. I have until recently characterized the eating of vegetables as a chore. I had little affection, merely a distant regard, for anything green other than mint-chocolate-chip ice cream.\u000A\u000A Vegetable-based idealism was invented by Alice Waters in the \u002770s, which means that almost a half century passed before vegetables ascended to the pinnacle where they are now. If the process was slow, her acolytes were many. Most prominent was Dan Barber, who worked at Chez Panisse, her Berkeley restaurant, and has matched her as a vegetable idealist—he\u0027s the man who grew that Mokum carrot. Her pedestal is so broad it accommodates all manner of chefs. René Redzepi of Noma, known for foraging, is among her admirers. So is David Chang of Momofuku Ss&amp;#xE4;m Bar, identified with pork.\u000A\u000A To me Waters\u0027s greatest legacy is not her idealism and unrelenting proselytizing for organic vegetables. More worthwhile is her dedication to all plant life, including the ugly sort. In the front ranks of those that rose from lowliness and obscurity were Brussels sprouts.\u000A\u000A I recall them served cut up, seasoned with a splash of sherry vinegar, and fried crisp at Vetri in Philadelphia. They made the tectonic plates of my animal-protein palate shift. I ate them whole, with palm sugar and tamarind paste, at Little Serow in Washington, D.C. Then I encountered the Brussels-sprout taco with almond mole at Empell&amp;#xF3;n Cocina in New York, and I knew that the future of Brussels sprouts was safely in the hands of the hipsters. After all, they\u0027re the people who influence how we eat these days.\u000A\u000A Kale has made the greatest comeback of all vegetables. One winter day it appeared in a salad at Battersby in Brooklyn, crisped up and placed atop veggies dressed with fish sauce, garlic, and chiles. An entire borough was transfid. Last year kale started making inroads in Paris, where the exceptionally vegetable-friendly Alain Passard of the Michelin three-star Restaurant Arp&amp;#xE8;ge said, \u0022It has a personality, a character, a power. It unlocks creativity. It touches on all the senses.\u0022\u000A\u000A Great as the products used in vegetable preparations might be, I believe that the triumph of vegetables is more about great cooking: An heirloom beet prepared by somebody like me is going to taste worse than a canned beet cooked by somebody who knows what he\u0027s doing. That said, wonderful products are preferable to mediocre ones, and it is obvious that chefs are now passionate about sourcing better vegetables. They are doing more with them than anyone from past generations thought possible, a triumph of imagination, not newfangled cooking processes.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Vegetables used to be prepared by dumping them in a pot of boiling water. Then came grilling. A quarter century ago, black streaks from outdoor charring elicited sighs from awed guests. Now vegetables regularly show up raw, roasted, pickled, marinated, caramelized, blackened (ashtonishing!), steamed, smoked, and most fun of all, smoke-steamed. At Eleven Madison Park in New York, chef Daniel Humm put carrot tartare on his menu instead of commonplace beef tartare. And what could be more astounding than this: The butchering of vegetables has become an art form.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A If you are a natural-born Californian, like chef Thomas Keller, farm-to-table has always been part of your life. This is a difficult concept for East Coast urbanites, those of us who grew up eating A&amp;P frozen green beans, to grasp.\u000A\u000A As soon as he became the chief cook—chef would be too grand a word—at a restaurant called La Rive in Catskill, New York, Keller started growing vegetables. \u0022Although most of them were eaten by the deer, we were trying,\u0022 he says. When he purchased The French Laundry twenty years ago, it came with six tiny vegetable plots. He has remained steadfast in his admiration of vegetables, although now his are sourced from a three-acre plot across the road. The land is tended by four full-time gardeners. He also receives vegetables from local farmers who bring them to the back door of the restaurant. \u0022People stop by with bags of something,\u0022 he says. Here\u0027s a tip for those thinking of knocking: His favorite vegetable has always been beets.\u000A\u000A Keller had a vegetable—not quite vegetarian—menu at The French Laundry from the start, with 15 percent of customers ordering from it. \u0022That might not sound like much, but a lot of emphasis goes into it,\u0022 he says. When I mention the challenges of preparing vegetables, he puts it this way: \u0022Cooking them is fairly easy, although it is labor-intensive. Organizing the cooking for them to come out at the same time is difficult.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A All that we on the East Coast now love about vegetables has been known to those at the other end of the country for decades. The meticulous sourcing, the thought going into the cooking, and the appreciation shown by customers—that\u0027s all relatively novel around here. Keller reminded me of something so obvious that I was ashamed to admit I hadn\u0027t considered it: At a time when we are returning to traditional thinking about food as a treat that varies with the seasons, vegetables have an infinite number of them. \u0022There\u0027s an old saying that there are four seasons, but that\u0027s not true of vegetables,\u0022 he said. \u0022Each vegetable has its own season. Peas are three weeks. Fava beans are four. Asparagus is very short. Vegetables are week to week.\u0022\u000A\u000A Without sourcing exquisite vegetables, chefs are learning that care in preparation makes the difference. Just as every protein does not have to be the white meat of a blue-footed Bresse chicken or the fillet of prime Black Angus beef, every vegetable does not have to be gently lifted from the cradle of the earth and rushed to the back door of a three-star restaurant. Just as an abundance of pleasure can come from lesser cuts of meat, joy can be found in everyday vegetables.\u000A\u000A Absolute proof of this is the re-emergence of cauliflower, previously known to me only as smelly stuff. It was always the only vegetable—perhaps the only food—I despised. Now I find myself transfid by how good it can be.\u000A\u000A At Keller\u0027s Per Se, I ate an unreasonably satisfying cauliflower velouté, creamy and pure, thick and luxurious and scented with black truffles, the ultimate triumph of any meatless meal. The real surprise was that I liked the velouté so much. The reek of cauliflower, its undercurrent of corruption, was gone.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A I hope from all I\u0027ve said that nobody thinks I\u0027m becoming a vegetarian. What a foolish notion that is, to insist only on food with nutritional value. I\u0027m not a farm-to-table guy. I\u0027m a store-to-kitchen guy. There is nothing spiritual about my transformation. I do not look into a bowl of verdant spring-pea soup and see renewal. I look into a bowl of pea soup and hope to see flecks of meat from a ham bone.\u000A\u000A Dovetail in Manhattan best emplifies this relatively new trend: vegetables as the main element in a serving that includes meat. The restaurant offers a meatless-Monday menu and a mostly-meatless-Monday menu. It\u0027s time for a confession: I like vegetables a whole lot more if they come with a little meat. Some of the best dishes I\u0027ve eaten recently were those with both elements, the vegetables dominating. (This seems to be the best way to eat, which I only wish I had discovered. Others beat me to it.) I have become a committed vegetable eater.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s not easy to convince people of this. When I tell a waiter that I wish to eat vegetables, he assumes I am a vegetarian. Nobody thinks that I might simply be in the mood for them. Such a combination—less meat, more produce—does no harm to the palate. In fact, it does considerable good. When I eat that way, I discover an added benefit: I crave fewer desserts. However, I did have rosemary-eggplant tiramisu at Dirt Candy and sticky-toffee-parsnip cake at Dovetail that were brilliant examples of culinary sleight of hand.\u000A\u000A The four-course Monday tasting menus at Dovetail allow the diner to transport himself between meatless options and not-entirely-meatless options. I admit my two favorite dishes there were entirely meatless. One was the gnudi, which were melting packets of horseradish-accented cheesy pleasure seemingly devoid of corporeal structure, so light they seemed pinned to the plate by their beet-reduction sauce. The other was a black-cabbage galette. Never before have I had creamy, sensuous cabbage. I doubt that I will experience it again.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Dinner at Blue Hill is the most effortless of all vegetable-and-meat experiences. Everything from the plant kingdom seems to grow at this restaurant-and-farm complex in Westchester, and each vegetable is so startlingly sweet, I have wondered if Dan Barber injects sugar into the soil. My meal at the Manhattan branch of Blue Hill included a vegetable-focused, slightly meaty entrée of Forono beets with bordelaise sauce, which is decidedly not vegetarian, inasmuch as one of its ingredients is bone marrow. These deeply flavored beets, about as large as sausages, were unknown to me as well as to Google. When I first Googled \u0022Forono beets,\u0022 the response was \u0022Did you mean: Corona beer?\u0022\u000A\u000A The dish that encapsulates what I have learned about vegetables is called Garden, and it comes from The Elm, in Brooklyn. It\u0027s in a dark blue Staub cocotte and is intended for two. The serving pot sits in the middle of the table, an exquisite example of vegetables taking center stage, and it contains anywhere from thirty to sixty herbs and vegetables, depending on the season. I came in winter, and I found mushrooms, carrots, turnips, shallots, potatoes, and cauliflower, to name a few, each one individually cooked before being assembled within the pot.\u000A\u000A At the top were thinly sliced raw and pickled vegetables. The middle level consisted of glazed and buttered vegetables, and on the bottom were roasted vegetables I couldn\u0027t stop eating. When I got to this substructure, I started spearing every chunk, twirling it in the lingering liquid. I was surprised that vegetable juices could be so enticing. I later learned that the bottom layer of vegetables had been bathed in ham butter. What I couldn\u0027t resist was an impromptu ham-butter-veggie sauce.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A The Garden epitomized all that I now find irresistible about vegetables—their proud place as the centerpiece of a meal and their pairing with a modest quantity of meat. It also demonstrated why vegetable cooking is so difficult. The items were individually prepped before going into the pot, some of them pickled long before the restaurant opened for business.\u000A\u000A When I ate that dish, I thought back to what vegetables were like for most of my life. In my childhood, my mother bought bin-battered carrots from a grocery store, cut them into rings, and then boiled them until the orange started to fade. Later, I was among those who faithfully followed the instructions of Julia Child, who taught us to braise them until they were limp, then take the mess we had made and over-sauce it. I\u0027m not sure of everything that lies ahead, but I do know that vegetables will be the next wonder of the dining world.",

And the bloodier, thicker, greasier, saltier, the better. But a curious thing has happened recently. Call it the new green revolution.

No longer are carrots, beets, and cauliflower mere accessories, fated to sit humbly alongside whatever noble proteins are being honored by the chef. At Dirt Candy, a vegetable restaurant in New York, Amanda Cohen tempts unbelievers with an irresistible starter, much as the wicked witch captivated Hansel and Gretel with that gingerbread house.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.3"> Almost all customers begin their meal with jalape&amp;#xF1;o hush puppies&#x2014;hot, crunchy, spicy, and sweet on the inside. A side of maple butter adds to the bliss. When I last ate there, the hush puppies were soon surpassed by re-imagined onion pancakes, soft and puffy; fried cabbage jalape on a kohlrabi-noodle salad; and most astonishing of all, parsnip pillows on grilled watermelon radish. The parsnips in fact constituted new-style gnocchi, more alluring than the traditional Italian kind.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.5"> &quot;What you&#x2019;re eating,&quot; Cohen said to me after that meal, &quot;are not luxury ingredients. My vegetables come in bags. This is not Per Se, where every vegetable is beautiful and comes from someplace else. The carrots I serve here are just carrots.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.6"> But of course, they are not. We are entering a time of equalopportunity eating&#x2014;vegetables have achieved parity with meat and fish, inconceivable throughout most of my lifetime. They have taken their place at the center of the plate.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.7"> Until recently, few chefs had come close to unlocking the genetic code for transforming vegetables into satisfying main courses. Those who tried were considered freakish, like the alchemists who tried to change lead into gold. Finally, Cohen and other chefs have created the soul-satisfying entr&#xE9;e that is not a half pound of beef. &quot;Vegetables,&quot; she says, &quot;are the Wild West of cooking.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.8"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.9"> My generation possessed deeply personal thoughts about vegetables. We disliked them, each of us in our own way. It&#x2019;s not that we didn&#x2019;t eat them. We consumed multiple servings of McDonald&#x2019;s fries.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.a"> I grew up not caring if I ever saw another salad. Only twice do I recall an uncooked vegetable astounding me. One was organic asparagus served at the restaurant Sean&#x2019;s Panaroma in Australia, the other a Mokum carrot plucked from the earth at Blue Hill at Stone Barns.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.b"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582f5d509f0bee56440a812/master/w_925/food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-03.jpg" alt="food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;t=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;t=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f5d509f0bee56440a812%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-03.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f5d509f0bee56440a812%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-03.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.c"> <strong>Five Dishes That Will Make You Forget About Beef</strong></p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.d"> <strong>1.

Black-Cabbage Galette, Dovetail, Manhattan</strong></p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.m"> John Fraser&#x2019;s galette is brilliantly buttery, and his cabbage straight from paradise.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.n"> When all right-thinking people insisted that vegetables be organic or heirloom, I remained unmoved. I have until recently characterized the eating of vegetables as a chore. I had little affection, merely a distant regard, for anything green other than mint-chocolate-chip ice cream.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.o"> Vegetable-based idealism was invented by Alice Waters in the &#x2019;70s, which means that almost a half century passed before vegetables ascended to the pinnacle where they are now. If the process was slow, her acolytes were many. Most prominent was Dan Barber, who worked at Chez Panisse, her Berkeley restaurant, and has matched her as a vegetable idealist&#x2014;he&#x2019;s the man who grew that Mokum carrot. Her pedestal is so broad it accommodates all manner of chefs. Ren&#xE9; Redzepi of Noma, known for foraging, is among her admirers. So is David Chang of Momofuku Ss&amp;#xE4;m Bar, identified with pork.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.p"> To me Waters&#x2019;s greatest legacy is not her idealism and unrelenting proselytizing for organic vegetables. More worthwhile is her dedication to all plant life, including the ugly sort. In the front ranks of those that rose from lowliness and obscurity were Brussels sprouts.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.q"> I recall them served cut up, seasoned with a splash of sherry vinegar, and fried crisp at Vetri in Philadelphia. They made the tectonic plates of my animal-protein palate shift. I ate them whole, with palm sugar and tamarind paste, at Little Serow in Washington, D.C. Then I encountered the Brussels-sprout taco with almond mole at Empell&amp;#xF3;n Cocina in New York, and I knew that the future of Brussels sprouts was safely in the hands of the hipsters. After all, they&#x2019;re the people who influence how we eat these days.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.r"> Kale has made the greatest comeback of all vegetables. One winter day it appeared in a salad at Battersby in Brooklyn, crisped up and placed atop veggies dressed with fish sauce, garlic, and chiles. An entire borough was transfid. Last year kale started making inroads in Paris, where the exceptionally vegetable-friendly Alain Passard of the Michelin three-star Restaurant Arp&amp;#xE8;ge said, &quot;It has a personality, a character, a power. It unlocks creativity. It touches on all the senses.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.s"> Great as the products used in vegetable preparations might be, I believe that the triumph of vegetables is more about great cooking: An heirloom beet prepared by somebody like me is going to taste worse than a canned beet cooked by somebody who knows what he&#x2019;s doing. That said, wonderful products are preferable to mediocre ones, and it is obvious that chefs are now passionate about sourcing better vegetables. They are doing more with them than anyone from past generations thought possible, a triumph of imagination, not newfangled cooking processes.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.t"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582f5d53655c24c6c95330c/master/w_925/food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-04.jpg" alt="food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-04.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;t=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;t=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f5d53655c24c6c95330c%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-04.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f5d53655c24c6c95330c%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-04.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.u"> Vegetables used to be prepared by dumping them in a pot of boiling water. Then came grilling. A quarter century ago, black streaks from outdoor charring elicited sighs from awed guests. Now vegetables regularly show up raw, roasted, pickled, marinated, caramelized, blackened <em>(ashtonishing!),</em> steamed, smoked, and most fun of all, smoke-steamed. At Eleven Madison Park in New York, chef Daniel Humm put carrot tartare on his menu instead of commonplace beef tartare. And what could be more astounding than this: The butchering of vegetables has become an art form.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.v"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.w"> If you are a natural-born Californian, like chef Thomas Keller, farm-to-table has always been part of your life. This is a difficult concept for East Coast urbanites, those of us who grew up eating A&amp;P frozen green beans, to grasp.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.x"> As soon as he became the chief cook&#x2014;chef would be too grand a word&#x2014;at a restaurant called La Rive in Catskill, New York, Keller started growing vegetables. &quot;Although most of them were eaten by the deer, we were trying,&quot; he says. When he purchased The French Laundry twenty years ago, it came with six tiny vegetable plots. He has remained steadfast in his admiration of vegetables, although now his are sourced from a three-acre plot across the road. The land is tended by four full-time gardeners. He also receives vegetables from local farmers who bring them to the back door of the restaurant. &quot;People stop by with bags of something,&quot; he says. Here&#x2019;s a tip for those thinking of knocking: His favorite vegetable has always been beets.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.y"> Keller had a vegetable&#x2014;not quite vegetarian&#x2014;menu at The French Laundry from the start, with 15 percent of customers ordering from it. &quot;That might not sound like much, but a lot of emphasis goes into it,&quot; he says. When I mention the challenges of preparing vegetables, he puts it this way: &quot;Cooking them is fairly easy, although it is labor-intensive. Organizing the cooking for them to come out at the same time is difficult.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.z"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582f5d53655c24c6c953306/master/w_925/food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-02.jpg" alt="food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;t=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;t=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f5d53655c24c6c953306%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-02.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f5d53655c24c6c953306%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-02.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.10"> All that we on the East Coast now love about vegetables has been known to those at the other end of the country for decades. The meticulous sourcing, the thought going into the cooking, and the appreciation shown by customers&#x2014;that&#x2019;s all relatively novel around here. Keller reminded me of something so obvious that I was ashamed to admit I hadn&#x2019;t considered it: At a time when we are returning to traditional thinking about food as a treat that varies with the seasons, vegetables have an infinite number of them. &quot;There&#x2019;s an old saying that there are four seasons, but that&#x2019;s not true of vegetables,&quot; he said. &quot;Each vegetable has its own season. Peas are three weeks. Fava beans are four. Asparagus is very short. Vegetables are week to week.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.11"> Without sourcing exquisite vegetables, chefs are learning that care in preparation makes the difference. Just as every protein does not have to be the white meat of a blue-footed Bresse chicken or the fillet of prime Black Angus beef, every vegetable does not have to be gently lifted from the cradle of the earth and rushed to the back door of a three-star restaurant. Just as an abundance of pleasure can come from lesser cuts of meat, joy can be found in everyday vegetables.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.12"> Absolute proof of this is the re-emergence of cauliflower, previously known to me only as smelly stuff. It was always the only vegetable&#x2014;perhaps the only food&#x2014;I despised. Now I find myself transfid by how good it can be.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.13"> At Keller&#x2019;s Per Se, I ate an unreasonably satisfying cauliflower velout&#xE9;, creamy and pure, thick and luxurious and scented with black truffles, the ultimate triumph of any meatless meal. The real surprise was that I liked the velout&#xE9; so much. The reek of cauliflower, its undercurrent of corruption, was gone.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.14"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.15"> I hope from all I&#x2019;ve said that nobody thinks I&#x2019;m becoming a vegetarian. What a foolish notion that is, to insist only on food with nutritional value. I&#x2019;m not a farm-to-table guy. I&#x2019;m a store-to-kitchen guy. There is nothing spiritual about my transformation. I do not look into a bowl of verdant spring-pea soup and see renewal. I look into a bowl of pea soup and hope to see flecks of meat from a ham bone.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.16"> Dovetail in Manhattan best emplifies this relatively new trend: vegetables as the main element in a serving that includes meat. The restaurant offers a meatless-Monday menu and a mostly-meatless-Monday menu. It&#x2019;s time for a confession: I like vegetables a whole lot more if they come with a little meat. Some of the best dishes I&#x2019;ve eaten recently were those with both elements, the vegetables dominating. (This seems to be the best way to eat, which I only wish I had discovered. Others beat me to it.) I have become a committed vegetable eater.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.17"> It&#x2019;s not easy to convince people of this. When I tell a waiter that I wish to eat vegetables, he assumes I am a vegetarian. Nobody thinks that I might simply be in the mood for them. Such a combination&#x2014;less meat, more produce&#x2014;does no harm to the palate. In fact, it does considerable good. When I eat that way, I discover an added benefit: I crave fewer desserts. However, I did have rosemary-eggplant tiramisu at Dirt Candy and sticky-toffee-parsnip cake at Dovetail that were brilliant examples of culinary sleight of hand.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.18"> The four-course Monday tasting menus at Dovetail allow the diner to transport himself between meatless options and not-entirely-meatless options. I admit my two favorite dishes there were entirely meatless. One was the <em>gnudi</em>, which were melting packets of horseradish-accented cheesy pleasure seemingly devoid of corporeal structure, so light they seemed pinned to the plate by their beet-reduction sauce. The other was a black-cabbage galette. Never before have I had creamy, sensuous cabbage. I doubt that I will experience it again.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.19"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582f5d509f0bee56440a815/master/w_925/food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-05.jpg" alt="food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-05.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;t=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;t=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f5d509f0bee56440a815%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-05.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f5d509f0bee56440a815%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-05.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> Dinner at Blue Hill is the most effortless of all vegetable-and-meat experiences. Everything from the plant kingdom seems to grow at this restaurant-and-farm complex in Westchester, and each vegetable is so startlingly sweet, I have wondered if Dan Barber injects sugar into the soil. My meal at the Manhattan branch of Blue Hill included a vegetable-focused, slightly meaty entr&#xE9;e of Forono beets with bordelaise sauce, which is decidedly not vegetarian, inasmuch as one of its ingredients is bone marrow. These deeply flavored beets, about as large as sausages, were unknown to me as well as to Google. When I first Googled &quot;Forono beets,&quot; the response was &quot;Did you mean: <em>Corona beer?&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> The dish that encapsulates what I have learned about vegetables is called Garden, and it comes from The Elm, in Brooklyn. It&#x2019;s in a dark blue Staub cocotte and is intended for two. The serving pot sits in the middle of the table, an exquisite example of vegetables taking center stage, and it contains anywhere from thirty to sixty herbs and vegetables, depending on the season. I came in winter, and I found mushrooms, carrots, turnips, shallots, potatoes, and cauliflower, to name a few, each one individually cooked before being assembled within the pot.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> At the top were thinly sliced raw and pickled vegetables. The middle level consisted of glazed and buttered vegetables, and on the bottom were roasted vegetables I couldn&#x2019;t stop eating. When I got to this substructure, I started spearing every chunk, twirling it in the lingering liquid. I was surprised that vegetable juices could be so enticing. I later learned that the bottom layer of vegetables had been bathed in ham butter. What I couldn&#x2019;t resist was an impromptu ham-butter-veggie sauce.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582f5d53655c24c6c953308/master/w_925/food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-06.jpg" alt="food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-06.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;t=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;t=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f5d53655c24c6c953308%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-06.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fvegetarian-dining-alan-richman&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f5d53655c24c6c953308%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-06.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-2014-05-eat-your-vegetables-eat-your-vegetables-gq-magazine-may-2014-health-food-greens-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> The Garden epitomized all that I now find irresistible about vegetables&#x2014;their proud place as the centerpiece of a meal and their pairing with a modest quantity of meat. It also demonstrated why vegetable cooking is so difficult. The items were individually prepped before going into the pot, some of them pickled long before the restaurant opened for business.</p><p data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> When I ate that dish, I thought back to what vegetables were like for most of my life. In my childhood, my mother bought bin-battered carrots from a grocery store, cut them into rings, and then boiled them until the orange started to fade. Later, I was among those who faithfully followed the instructions of Julia Child, who taught us to braise them until they were limp, then take the mess we had made and over-sauce it. I&#x2019;m not sure of everything that lies ahead, but I do know that vegetables will be the next wonder of the dining world.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".oek6tol05c.1.1.0.0.5"><div
