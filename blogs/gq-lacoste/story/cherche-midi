  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMy fourth visit to Cherche Midi was like the first three: No sign of Keith McNally.\u000A\u000A I\u0027ve never seen him, except in photographs, and there are few of those. We once spoke on the phone, when I called to ask if he would ever open a restaurant in Las Vegas. The voice on the other end assured me it wouldn\u0027t happen. (So far, he\u0027s a man of his word.)\u000A\u000AWhen restaurateurs open new places, they tend to show up, at least at the start, providing a welcoming and reassuring presence. Sirio Maccioni of Le Cirque was always around. I don\u0027t think Drew Nieporent has missed an evening at his new Batard. I hear McNally is very hands-on when he\u0027s planning a new place. He\u0027s sure hands-off once the doors open.\u000A\u000AA friend with me at my first visit claimed I was wrong. \u0022I\u0027m sure he\u0027s here,\u0022 she said. \u0022I feel his presence.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat gave me the creeps. Bravely, I went looking. Cherche Midi is small, only 80 seats, with everything on one level except the restrooms, which are down a flight. He was nowhere. My final stop was the restrooms, which are semi-communal, like the ones at Schiller\u0027s Liquor Bar and at old French institutions like grade schools. Men and women stand side-by-side at large tubs with twist handle spigots. I asked the young woman washing up next to me if she minded. She smiled nervously, then admitted it was kind of interesting.\u000A\u000AI consider McNally one of our essential living restaurateurs, assuming he exists. He is New York\u0027s—maybe America\u0027s—master of informal design and décor. Nobody appreciates and restores aesthetics the way he does. He has opened nearly a dozen places in the past 30 years, and all but one remain in business.\u000A\u000ACherche Midi is his newest and also one of his best. I ate practically everything on the menu with pleasure, the prime rib with awe. It\u0027s served boneless, along with a basket of those insubstantial yet devilishly delicious hollow puffs of fried potato called pommes soufflées. The meat was luscious, an inch-and-a-quarter thick and enhanced with supercharged jus, probably the best prime rib in these parts since the last time a cattle drive came through town. Just when you\u0027re overdosing on fat, meat and gravy, out comes a tiny gem lettuce salad with vinaigrette, the equivalent of a mid-course digestif.\u000A\u000AThere are other dishes almost as good, including a stirring steak au poivre. Here\u0027s a round-up of my disappointments: The lobster ravioli was clunky, although others seem to like it. The roasted cauliflower was so mushy I can\u0027t believe it has admirers.\u000A\u000AThe restaurant is located on the corner of Houston and Bowery, the site of one of McNally\u0027s few mistakes, the Italian restaurant Pulino\u0027s. He has obliterated any vestige of that establishment, wiped it away. Cherche Midi has a different look, a different vibe, different food. Mostly, it\u0027s French. McNally, in his enduring role as the Oz of the restaurant world—invisible, disembodied, omnipotent—is no mastermind when it comes to Italian food. His two Italian restaurants, Morandi and Pulino\u0027s, were awkward. Morandi endures.\u000A\u000AMcNally tends to underperform on exterior design. Pulino\u0027s was open to the world, with an excess of windows looking out onto a street corner lacking any visual appeal. Cherche Midi is a return to his impregnable fortress look. The name is written in thick block letters. The exterior walls are mostly wood and brick, a kind of half-timbered, Alsatian garage look. There are a few large windows, but you might not notice them when walking past. In the late afternoon, they allow lovely light to enter the dining room. Cherche Midi is appealing within, whatever the hour.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s brilliant at interior ambience, in this case cozy French: a multitude of mirrors, floors with mosaic-size tiles, walls with subway tiles, globe lights, red-leather booths, battered chairs that suggest he picked them up off the street, small but impressive flower arrangements. It looks classic French to me, but a magician like him could trick anyone into believing anything. Tables are accessorized to the bistro max: little pepper mills, fleur de sel in tiny wooden bowls, water in ceramic pitchers. Balthazar Bakery bread comes in a little wicker basket lined with hand-stitched linen, and there\u0027s plenty of it.\u000A\u000ACherche Midi does not feel like a typical downtown restaurant—the kind that serves what one of my guests calls \u0022uncomfort food.\u0022 I don\u0027t know how McNally does it, but it\u0027s an uncannily civil establishment. Maybe it\u0027s due to the patient, pleasant, and obliging staff—hiring competent people is another of his accomplishments. The bar was never two-deep on any of my visits. One evening a woman sat there with an aperitif, reading a newspaper, an engaging scene. Patrons seem interested in eating, chatting and behaving, although on my final visit a fellow in a purple T-shirt seated next to me spent most of his meal with a cellphone tucked under his chin, ignoring his wife, talking loudly to someone about MasterCard, and gobbling prime rib, a disturbing and unsavory sight. At least he ordered well.\u000A\u000AA special appetizer of chicken consommé with diced vegetables, edible flowers, foie gras, and black truffle, arrived cold, which startled me. \u0022Of course it\u0027s cold!\u0022 my friend said to me, defending a restaurant she immediately loved. \u0022It\u0027s July.\u0022 It\u0027s a fine dish, and I look forward to November, when it might be hot. Frog legs are beautifully fried and come in a tangy, tasty but too aggressive garlic velouté—frog\u0027s legs are a delicacy, easily overwhelmed. Steak tartare has excellent beef and is more about the changing tastes of New York than the classic tastes of Paris. These days, restaurants in New York tend to wildly overdress their beef tartare, gooping it up, confusing it with chicken salad. (They\u0027re not disguising bad meat. They\u0027re disguising good meat.) Steak frites, the bistro standard, is exactly as it should be, not spectacular but entirely satisfying. If you like your fries very thin, very crisp, very hot, very salty and cooked in fresh oil—but with little potato flavor—these will please you. The same can be said of the onion rings, which have everything you could hope for except strapping onion intensity.\u000A\u000AA whole grilled dorade, bone in, was soft and succulent. Skate wing was correct in a daring new way. It came on the bone, and while fish this way is always tastier, it\u0027s also more work, in the case of skate a real struggle. With it were finely diced potatoes and soft, onion-fennel puree. Both were wonderfully satisfying and exceptionally easy to eat.\u000A\u000AIf there are imperfections in a long list of well-prepared dishes, it might be one garnish too many. The multi-colored beet salad, made with oversized, thinly cut beet slices and dressed with chervil, slivers of sheep\u0027s milk cheese, and Sicilian pistachios, didn\u0027t need the nuts, good as they are. The tomato salad with hearts of palm and pickled red onion also had intensely flavored bits of spearmint, very Wrigley\u0027s. Peppering the fresh hamachi crudo was yuzu, radish, espelette and shiso, clearly more than enough. All those extras could be about generosity or ambition, or about McNally giving today\u0027s customers what they want.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AThe bartender—goateed, persuasive, charming, and French- accented—loved to chat, which I why I asked him the meaning of the restaurant\u0027s name. He stood straight, took a deep breath, waved his hands in the air, took another deep breath and said, in many more words than these, that it was about the search for the good life. Then he offered to provide a second meaning, one he said was \u0022even more poetic,\u0022 but I declined with thanks. Those were enough deep thoughts for a guy having a burger at the bar. It\u0027s an extremely good burger, too, made from that deeply flavored prime rib meat. So that no taste is left behind, atop the burger are a multitude of umami-style additives: bacon marmalade, roasted mushrooms, and gruyere. That\u0027s about as much flavor as a burger can possess and a man can bear.\u000A\u000AThe wine list is scattershot but filled with very fair prices. When a bottle I ordered, a nicely aged Savigny-lès-Beaune, turned out not to be available (I hate when that happens), the maitre d\u0027 suggested a 2011 Bourgogne Rouge for $57, a wine I\u0027d passed over in the mistaken belief that nothing called Bourgogne is any good if it costs so little. The wine needed a little chilling—in France, red wine in bistros is often too warm, although no longer are bottles routinely stored on shelves above the stoves. An astounding bargain here are the carafes of wine, two whites and two reds, each costing $18 and each the equivalent of three-quarters of a bottle. There\u0027s also a 2007 Muscadet for $34. Aged Muscadets, once scorned but now a favorite of sommeliers, usually come with elevated prices. Here\u0027s your chance.\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s cheese, as there must be, not the very ripe and runny kind, although the Old Chatham Camembert comes close. They\u0027re presented with honeycomb, apricot compote, walnuts and yet another round of complimentary bread, plenty of it, which so startled my friend that she blurted to the waiter, \u0022What, are you out of your minds, not charging for bread?\u0022 Desserts are comforting, well-made, and mostly classic French—île flottante (meringue clouds in crème anglaise), soufflés, pot de crème, and to me the best of all, perfectly ecuted crêpes suzette, warm and buttery. The specials are less French but just as appealing. One included a transcendent slice of pound cake that tasted as though it had been out of the oven just long enough to cool.\u000A\u000AOne of my admiring guests thought Cherche Midi was \u0022the kind of place where Jacques Pépin worked as a boy.\u0022 I was reminded of the favorite haunt of the famous, fictional character Chief Superintendent Maigret of the Paris Brigade Criminelle. He was always off to lunch at a bistro in the Place Dauphine and saying with great satisfaction, \u0022They have a good white wine.\u0022 I mentioned to one of our waiters, a veteran of Pastis, that I found Cherche Midi more sensible, satisfying, and all-inclusive than either Pastis or Balthazar, the two signature spots of McNally\u0027s French collection. He said Cherche Midi reflected McNally\u0027s feminine side, a lovely thought, because the best of the old bistros of Paris always were charming and warm-hearted.\u000A\u000AStars: Three\u000A\u000ADon\u0027t Miss This:\u000A\u000A Cocktail: Flower of Scotland (gin, lemon, fresh basil, espelette syrup), $15\u000ACarafe of white wine: 2012 Uvaggio Vermentino, $18\u000ACarafe of red wine: 2013 Chateau du Chatelard, $18\u000AWhite Wine: 2007 Coing de Saint-Fiacre Muscadet, $36\u000ARed Wine: 2011 d\u0027Ardhuy Bourgogne, $57\u000AAppetizer: Frog Legs, $19\u000AFish Entrée: Bone-In Skate Wing Meunière, $24\u000AMeat Entrée: Dry-Aged Prime Rib, $48\u000ADessert: Crêpes Suzette, $10",

Cherche Midi was like the first three: No sign of Keith McNally.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.2"> I&apos;ve never seen him, except in photographs, and there are few of those. We once spoke on the phone, when I called to ask if he would ever open a restaurant in Las Vegas. The voice on the other end assured me it wouldn&apos;t happen. (So far, he&apos;s a man of his word.)</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.3">When restaurateurs open new places, they tend to show up, at least at the start, providing a welcoming and reassuring presence. Sirio Maccioni of Le Cirque was always around. I don&apos;t think Drew Nieporent has missed an evening at his new Batard. I hear McNally is very hands-on when he&apos;s planning a new place. He&apos;s sure hands-off once the doors open.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.5">A friend with me at my first visit claimed I was wrong. &quot;I&apos;m sure he&apos;s here,&quot; she said. &quot;I feel his presence.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.6">That gave me the creeps. Bravely, I went looking. Cherche Midi is small, only 80 seats, with everything on one level except the restrooms, which are down a flight. He was nowhere. My final stop was the restrooms, which are semi-communal, like the ones at Schiller&apos;s Liquor Bar and at old French institutions like grade schools. Men and women stand side-by-side at large tubs with twist handle spigots. I asked the young woman washing up next to me if she minded. She smiled nervously, then admitted it was kind of interesting.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.7">I consider McNally one of our essential living restaurateurs, assuming he exists. He is New York&apos;s&#x2014;maybe America&apos;s&#x2014;master of informal design and d&#xE9;cor. Nobody appreciates and restores aesthetics the way he does. He has opened nearly a dozen places in the past 30 years, and all but one remain in business.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.8">Cherche Midi is his newest and also one of his best. I ate practically everything on the menu with pleasure, the prime rib with awe. It&apos;s served boneless, along with a basket of those insubstantial yet devilishly delicious hollow puffs of fried potato called pommes souffl&#xE9;es. The meat was luscious, an inch-and-a-quarter thick and enhanced with supercharged jus, probably the best prime rib in these parts since the last time a cattle drive came through town. Just when you&apos;re overdosing on fat, meat and gravy, out comes a tiny gem lettuce salad with vinaigrette, the equivalent of a mid-course digestif.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.9">There are other dishes almost as good, including a stirring steak au poivre. Here&apos;s a round-up of my disappointments: The lobster ravioli was clunky, although others seem to like it. The roasted cauliflower was so mushy I can&apos;t believe it has admirers.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.a">The restaurant is located on the corner of Houston and Bowery, the site of one of McNally&apos;s few mistakes, the Italian restaurant Pulino&apos;s. He has obliterated any vestige of that establishment, wiped it away. Cherche Midi has a different look, a different vibe, different food. Mostly, it&apos;s French. McNally, in his enduring role as the Oz of the restaurant world&#x2014;invisible, disembodied, omnipotent&#x2014;is no mastermind when it comes to Italian food. His two Italian restaurants, Morandi and Pulino&apos;s, were awkward. Morandi endures.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.b">McNally tends to underperform on exterior design. Pulino&apos;s was open to the world, with an excess of windows looking out onto a street corner lacking any visual appeal. Cherche Midi is a return to his impregnable fortress look. The name is written in thick block letters. The exterior walls are mostly wood and brick, a kind of half-timbered, Alsatian garage look. There are a few large windows, but you might not notice them when walking past. In the late afternoon, they allow lovely light to enter the dining room. Cherche Midi is appealing within, whatever the hour.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.c">He&apos;s brilliant at interior ambience, in this case cozy French: a multitude of mirrors, floors with mosaic-size tiles, walls with subway tiles, globe lights, red-leather booths, battered chairs that suggest he picked them up off the street, small but impressive flower arrangements. It looks classic French to me, but a magician like him could trick anyone into believing anything. Tables are accessorized to the bistro max: little pepper mills, fleur de sel in tiny wooden bowls, water in ceramic pitchers. Balthazar Bakery bread comes in a little wicker basket lined with hand-stitched linen, and there&apos;s plenty of it.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.d">Cherche Midi does not feel like a typical downtown restaurant&#x2014;the kind that serves what one of my guests calls &quot;uncomfort food.&quot; I don&apos;t know how McNally does it, but it&apos;s an uncannily civil establishment. Maybe it&apos;s due to the patient, pleasant, and obliging staff&#x2014;hiring competent people is another of his accomplishments. The bar was never two-deep on any of my visits. One evening a woman sat there with an aperitif, reading a newspaper, an engaging scene. Patrons seem interested in eating, chatting and behaving, although on my final visit a fellow in a purple T-shirt seated next to me spent most of his meal with a cellphone tucked under his chin, ignoring his wife, talking loudly to someone about MasterCard, and gobbling prime rib, a disturbing and unsavory sight. At least he ordered well.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.e">A special appetizer of chicken consomm&#xE9; with diced vegetables, edible flowers, foie gras, and black truffle, arrived cold, which startled me. &quot;Of course it&apos;s cold!&quot; my friend said to me, defending a restaurant she immediately loved. &quot;It&apos;s July.&quot; It&apos;s a fine dish, and I look forward to November, when it might be hot. Frog legs are beautifully fried and come in a tangy, tasty but too aggressive garlic velout&#xE9;&#x2014;frog&apos;s legs are a delicacy, easily overwhelmed. Steak tartare has excellent beef and is more about the changing tastes of New York than the classic tastes of Paris. These days, restaurants in New York tend to wildly overdress their beef tartare, gooping it up, confusing it with chicken salad. (They&apos;re not disguising bad meat. They&apos;re disguising good meat.) Steak frites, the bistro standard, is exactly as it should be, not spectacular but entirely satisfying. If you like your fries very thin, very crisp, very hot, very salty and cooked in fresh oil&#x2014;but with little potato flavor&#x2014;these will please you. The same can be said of the onion rings, which have everything you could hope for except strapping onion intensity.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.f">A whole grilled dorade, bone in, was soft and succulent. Skate wing was correct in a daring new way. It came on the bone, and while fish this way is always tastier, it&apos;s also more work, in the case of skate a real struggle. With it were finely diced potatoes and soft, onion-fennel puree. Both were wonderfully satisfying and exceptionally easy to eat.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.g">If there are imperfections in a long list of well-prepared dishes, it might be one garnish too many. The multi-colored beet salad, made with oversized, thinly cut beet slices and dressed with chervil, slivers of sheep&apos;s milk cheese, and Sicilian pistachios, didn&apos;t need the nuts, good as they are. The tomato salad with hearts of palm and pickled red onion also had intensely flavored bits of spearmint, very Wrigley&apos;s. Peppering the fresh hamachi crudo was yuzu, radish, espelette and shiso, clearly more than enough. All those extras could be about generosity or ambition, or about McNally giving today&apos;s customers what they want.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.h">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.i">The bartender&#x2014;goateed, persuasive, charming, and French- accented&#x2014;loved to chat, which I why I asked him the meaning of the restaurant&apos;s name. He stood straight, took a deep breath, waved his hands in the air, took another deep breath and said, in many more words than these, that it was about the search for the good life. Then he offered to provide a second meaning, one he said was &quot;even more poetic,&quot; but I declined with thanks. Those were enough deep thoughts for a guy having a burger at the bar. It&apos;s an extremely good burger, too, made from that deeply flavored prime rib meat. So that no taste is left behind, atop the burger are a multitude of umami-style additives: bacon marmalade, roasted mushrooms, and gruyere. That&apos;s about as much flavor as a burger can possess and a man can bear.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.j">The wine list is scattershot but filled with very fair prices. When a bottle I ordered, a nicely aged Savigny<em>-</em>l&#xE8;s<em>-</em>Beaune, turned out not to be available (I hate when that happens), the maitre d&apos; suggested a 2011 Bourgogne Rouge for $57, a wine I&apos;d passed over in the mistaken belief that nothing called Bourgogne is any good if it costs so little. The wine needed a little chilling&#x2014;in France, red wine in bistros is often too warm, although no longer are bottles routinely stored on shelves above the stoves. An astounding bargain here are the carafes of wine, two whites and two reds, each costing $18 and each the equivalent of three-quarters of a bottle. There&apos;s also a 2007 Muscadet for $34. Aged Muscadets, once scorned but now a favorite of sommeliers, usually come with elevated prices. Here&apos;s your chance.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.k">There&apos;s cheese, as there must be, not the very ripe and runny kind, although the Old Chatham Camembert comes close. They&apos;re presented with honeycomb, apricot compote, walnuts and yet another round of complimentary bread, plenty of it, which so startled my friend that she blurted to the waiter, &quot;What, are you out of your minds, not charging for bread?&quot; Desserts are comforting, well-made, and mostly classic French&#x2014;&#xEE;le flottante (meringue clouds in cr&#xE8;me anglaise), souffl&#xE9;s, pot de cr&#xE8;me, and to me the best of all, perfectly ecuted cr&#xEA;pes suzette, warm and buttery. The specials are less French but just as appealing. One included a transcendent slice of pound cake that tasted as though it had been out of the oven just long enough to cool.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.l">One of my admiring guests thought Cherche Midi was &quot;the kind of place where Jacques P&#xE9;pin worked as a boy.&quot; I was reminded of the favorite haunt of the famous, fictional character Chief Superintendent Maigret of the Paris <em>Brigade Criminelle. </em>He was always off to lunch at a bistro in the Place Dauphine and saying with great satisfaction, &quot;They have a good white wine.&quot; I mentioned to one of our waiters, a veteran of Pastis, that I found Cherche Midi more sensible, satisfying, and all-inclusive than either Pastis or Balthazar, the two signature spots of McNally&apos;s French collection. He said Cherche Midi reflected McNally&apos;s feminine side, a lovely thought, because the best of the old bistros of Paris always were charming and warm-hearted.</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Stars:</strong> Three</p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>Don&apos;t Miss This:</strong></p><p data-reactid=".19le0hcwe80.1.1.0.0.4.o"> Cocktail: Flower of Scotland (gin, lemon, fresh basil, espelette syrup), $15
