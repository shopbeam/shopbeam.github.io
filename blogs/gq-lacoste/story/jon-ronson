  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADo you remember Justine Sacco? The New York PR professional who landed in Cape Town after an 11-hour flight only to discover that a tweet she posted to her humble 170 followers before takeoff—\u0022Going to Africa. Hope I don\u0027t get AIDS. Just kidding. I\u0027m white!\u0022—was now the center of a five-alarm shitstorm that started as genuine outrage, but had now morphed into perverse fascination with the fact she was blissfully unaware of the unfolding pandemonium, and would remain that way until she turned her phone back on at this exact moment. (See: the hashtag #HasJustineLandedYet.)\u000A\u000ASacco, who you won\u0027t be surprised to hear lost her job during the incident—probably somewhere over the Democratic Republic of the Congo—is one of several people profiled in frequent GQ contributor Jon Ronson\u0027s new book So You\u0027ve Been Publicly Shamed. In it, Ronson talks to several people who were famously vilified in similar episodes, and the table of contents reads like a Who\u0027s Who of backfired jokes and career-shattering misconduct. GQ called Ronson to talk the history of shame and its revival thanks to social media.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASo what should we be avoiding in 2015 if we don\u0027t want to find ourselves, like Sacco, in the proverbial stocks?\u000A\u000A The perceived misuse of privilege, that\u0027s the most shamable offense these days. Obviously that\u0027s better than more shame-worthy transgressions, like being caught in the conventional sex scandal, which was the thing that used to ruin people in the \u002770s.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s so wrong with ruining people for misusing their privilege?\u000A\u000A People shouldn\u0027t misuse their privilege, of course, but there is a huge problem to it, which is that most of the people in my book didn\u0027t misuse their privilege. It just sort of looked that way if you half closed your eyes.\u000A\u000AIn PR they always say the worst kind of scandal is the kind that confirmed what people already thought they knew about you. Is that what you mean?\u000A\u000A If you\u0027re a celebrity. If you\u0027re a normal person like Justine Sacco or Lindsey Stone nobody knows anything about you because you don\u0027t have any kind of profile. So instead it\u0027s like we\u0027re all Miss Marples looking for clues as to your inherent evil, and it\u0027s kind of ridiculous because people, by and large, aren\u0027t inherently evil. A lot of people who get shamed get shamed because of a bunch of baggage that really isn\u0027t their responsibility. So with Justine, when people brought her down they weren\u0027t just bringing her down, they were bringing down blonde, sassy New Yorkers who look like they have fun at parties. With Jonah Lehrer, he was being brought down by people who didn\u0027t like pop psychology books, and things like TED, even though he has never given a TED talk.\u000A\u000ABut they did something wrong.\u000A\u000A Of course. I mean, Justine\u0027s tweet was kind of ridiculous, and stupid and she shouldn\u0027t have done it. But, nonetheless, there was other stuff going on as well.\u000A\u000AShe certainly isn\u0027t responsible for all bad comedy.\u000A\u000A Or racism. There is a huge gap between intending to be racist and accidentally coming over as racist when your comment is stripped of its nuance by being yanked out of your social circle.\u000A\u000AIt feels now like we\u0027re living in the most easily galled time in human history. Is it just because of the Internet, or is there something else about now that has lead to it?\u000A\u000A I think it\u0027s a bit of a perfect storm. Some of it is to do with the fact that hitherto silenced people have been given a voice. As a result a lot of good things have happened like Black Lives Matter, and the Daily Mail getting attacked if they print a homophobic or racist column, and all that stuff is great because it\u0027s a leveling of the playing field and a sort of democratization of justice. But the problem is that when you taste victory, you can be really prone to going after people who don\u0027t deserve it. I wish I\u0027d thought of this when I was writing the book: it\u0027s our kind of desperate desire to be empathetic, that\u0027s what\u0027s leading us to commit deeply un-empathetic acts. Similarly, the Internet is sort of like the drone operator who doesn\u0027t need to feel responsible for the Pashtun village. Also, there is a weird thing going on with social media where you surround yourself with people who feel the same way that you do. So you kind of mutually approve of each other and it encourages you to carry on doing what you\u0027ve been doing.\u000A\u000AWould it help if I followed a whole bunch of people who don\u0027t agree with me?\u000A\u000A Yes. I really think that would help because that\u0027s democracy.\u000A\u000AWho do you follow who you don\u0027t agree with?\u000A\u000A Oh, lots of people: Adam Baldwin, Louise Mensch, Donald Trump…loads and loads of people. But it\u0027s not just enough to follow people you don\u0027t agree with. Another thing that\u0027s happening on the Internet is we all create for ourselves and each other these kind of artificial high dramas where we\u0027re all pretending everyone is either an incredible hero or a sickening villain. Everything is really heightened.\u000A\u000ADo you remember a time when you\u0027ve fallen victim to that high drama?\u000A\u000A Oh yeah, so many times, which is part of the reason why I wanted to write this book. I started a Twitter campaign against A.A. Gill because he wrote a column about how he\u0027d shot a baboon on safari because he wonders what it\u0027d be like to shoot a person.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s the trajectory of a public shaming?\u000A\u000A Well, it flares up incredibly fast. Then, anything you try and do after that is counterproductive—other than just apologizing and shutting the fuck up. All you can do is go completely quiet and withdraw yourself from society for, like, a year and hope someone like me eventually comes along and says, \u0022I think you were the victim in this.\u0022\u000A\u000AHave you heard of this subreddit r/cringe? It\u0027s where people post videos they\u0027ve found of other people doing unselfaware, embarrassing stuff for everyone to look at and pick it apart.\u000A\u000A Isn\u0027t it terrible that of this Garden of Eden of the Internet is full of these mutated plants? I hate to be such a moralist, but if you\u0027d been on the kind of journey I\u0027ve been on the last couple of years you honestly would find it harder to go on those kinds of sites.\u000A\u000AWhere does the Internet\u0027s perverse fascination with people embarrassing themselves come from though?\u000A\u000A Part of it is the separation from reality. I tried in this book to narrow that space to nothing, and say this is what it feels like and it\u0027s incredibly anxiety-inducing to read. I deliberately wrote it so that people feel the agony. It kind of reads like a horror movie at times because you\u0027re feeling what it feels like to be Jonah Lehrer at that moment of exposure.\u000A\u000AI think we should only be allowed the Internet once a week.\u000A\u000A I did a story on the Ku Klux Klan trying to do an image makeover and they were only allowed one cross burning a year. So maybe that\u0027s what we should do.\u000A\u000AWhen you think about what happened to Justine Sacco, it\u0027s not so different from a cross burning.\u000A\u000A The bad result of them only having one cross burning a year was that they were really rusty and they couldn\u0027t remember anything. So one of my favorite memories of that day was all of them standing around the cross because they couldn\u0027t work out what to do, and then the leader came over and they all said \u0022Tom, Tom, do we soak it in kerosene and then raise it or do we raise it and then soak it?\u0022 And he said \u0022You soak it and then raise it. How are you going to soak it once you\u0027ve raised it?\u0022 And then he kind of looked at me as if to say, I\u0027m so sorry my members are such idiots.\u000A\u000ASo what\u0027s the worst side effect of all this public shaming?\u000A\u000A It\u0027s very destructive to society and I think it\u0027s created a conformist, conservative, fearful surveillance society, like the Stasi, and nobody wants to live in a Stasi state, and that\u0027s the world we\u0027re quite literally living in. I really don\u0027t think I\u0027m overreaching when I say that.\u000A\u000AIt seems like part of the reason people are so disconnected from politics right now is that it\u0027s impossible to relate to politicians who have to be so incredibly squeaky clean in order to get elected. Do you think those two things are related?\u000A\u000A Yes. Obviously that\u0027s untenable, because you can\u0027t have a situation where nobody can ever be elected president. So that has to change too. What I\u0027m advocating for in this book is a world where everyone is allowed to be a little bit flawed. I\u0027m not advocating for everyone be offensive. I feel the same way about that as everybody else. But I think people should be more forgiving about other people\u0027s mistakes. Not pretending to believe somebody is the worst tweet they ever wrote. The world has to go that way because eventually we\u0027re all going to be shamed.",

Justine Sacco? The New York PR professional who landed in Cape Town after an 11-hour flight only to discover that a tweet she posted to her humble 170 followers before takeoff&#x2014;&quot;Going to Africa. Hope I don&#x2019;t get AIDS. Just kidding. I&#x2019;m white!&quot;&#x2014;was now the center of a five-alarm shitstorm that started as genuine outrage, but had now morphed into perverse fascination with the fact she was blissfully unaware of the unfolding pandemonium, and would remain that way until she turned her phone back on at this exact moment. (See: the hashtag <a href="https://storify.com/mpchristoffels/best-of-hasjustinelandedyet">#HasJustineLandedYet</a>.)</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.2">Sacco, who you won&#x2019;t be surprised to hear lost her job during the incident&#x2014;probably somewhere over the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x2014;is one of several people profiled in <a href="../news-politics/big-issues/201207/amber-waves-of-green-jon-ronson-gq-july-2012">frequent</a> <a href="../news-politics/newsmakers/201211/jon-ronson-competitive-eating-contests-gq-november-2012"><em>GQ</em></a> <a href="../entertainment/celebrities/201306/how-to-be-a-fake-celebrity-june-2013">contributor</a> Jon Ronson&#x2019;s new book <em>So You&#x2019;ve Been Publicly Shamed</em>. In it, Ronson talks to several people who were famously vilified in similar episodes, and the table of contents reads like a Who&#x2019;s Who of backfired jokes and career-shattering misconduct. GQ called Ronson to talk the history of shame and its revival thanks to social media.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.3"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>So what should we be avoiding in 2015 if we don&#x2019;t want to find ourselves, like Sacco, in the proverbial stocks?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.6"> The perceived misuse of privilege, that&#x2019;s the most shamable offense these days. Obviously that&#x2019;s better than more shame-worthy transgressions, like being caught in the conventional sex scandal, which was the thing that used to ruin people in the &#x2019;70s.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>What&#x2019;s so wrong with ruining people for misusing their privilege?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.8"> People shouldn&#x2019;t misuse their privilege, of course, but there is a huge problem to it, which is that most of the people in my book didn&#x2019;t misuse their privilege. It just sort of looked that way if you half closed your eyes.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>In PR they always say the worst kind of scandal is the kind that confirmed what people already <em>thought</em></strong><strong> they knew about you. Is that what you mean?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.a"> If you&#x2019;re a celebrity. If you&#x2019;re a normal person like Justine Sacco or Lindsey Stone nobody knows anything about you because you don&#x2019;t have any kind of profile. So instead it&#x2019;s like we&#x2019;re all Miss Marples looking for clues as to your inherent evil, and it&#x2019;s kind of ridiculous because people, by and large, aren&#x2019;t inherently evil. A lot of people who get shamed get shamed because of a bunch of baggage that really isn&#x2019;t their responsibility. So with Justine, when people brought her down they weren&#x2019;t just bringing <em>her</em> down, they were bringing down blonde, sassy New Yorkers who look like they have fun at parties. With Jonah Lehrer, he was being brought down by people who didn&#x2019;t like pop psychology books, and things like TED, even though he has never given a TED talk.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>But they did <em>something </em></strong><strong>wrong.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Of course. I mean, Justine&#x2019;s tweet was kind of ridiculous, and stupid and she shouldn&#x2019;t have done it. But, nonetheless, there was other stuff going on as well.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>She certainly isn&#x2019;t responsible for all bad comedy.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.e"> Or racism. There is a huge gap between intending to be racist and accidentally coming over as racist when your comment is stripped of its nuance by being yanked out of your social circle.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>It feels now like we&#x2019;re living in the most easily galled time in human history. Is it just because of the Internet, or is there something else about now that has lead to it?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.g"> I think it&#x2019;s a bit of a perfect storm. Some of it is to do with the fact that hitherto silenced people have been given a voice. As a result a lot of good things have happened like Black Lives Matter, and the <em>Daily Mail</em> getting attacked if they print a homophobic or racist column, and all that stuff is great because it&#x2019;s a leveling of the playing field and a sort of democratization of justice. But the problem is that when you taste victory, you can be really prone to going after people who don&#x2019;t deserve it. I wish I&#x2019;d thought of this when I was writing the book: it&#x2019;s our kind of desperate desire to be empathetic, that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s leading us to commit deeply un-empathetic acts. Similarly, the Internet is sort of like the drone operator who doesn&#x2019;t need to feel responsible for the Pashtun village. Also, there is a weird thing going on with social media where you surround yourself with people who feel the same way that you do. So you kind of mutually approve of each other and it encourages you to carry on doing what you&#x2019;ve been doing.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>Would it help if I followed a whole bunch of people who don&#x2019;t agree with me?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.i"> Yes. I really think that would help because that&#x2019;s democracy.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>Who do you follow who you don&#x2019;t agree with?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.k"> Oh, lots of people: Adam Baldwin, Louise Mensch, Donald Trump&#x2026;loads and loads of people. But it&#x2019;s not just enough to follow people you don&#x2019;t agree with. Another thing that&#x2019;s happening on the Internet is we all create for ourselves and each other these kind of artificial high dramas where we&#x2019;re all pretending everyone is either an incredible hero or a sickening villain. Everything is really heightened.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>Do you remember a time when you&#x2019;ve fallen victim to that high drama?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.m"> Oh yeah, so many times, which is part of the reason why I wanted to write this book. I started a Twitter campaign against A.A. Gill because he wrote a column about how he&#x2019;d shot a baboon on safari because he wonders what it&#x2019;d be like to shoot a person.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>What&#x2019;s the trajectory of a public shaming?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.o"> Well, it flares up incredibly fast. Then, anything you try and do after that is counterproductive&#x2014;other than just apologizing and shutting the fuck up. All you can do is go completely quiet and withdraw yourself from society for, like, a year and hope someone like me eventually comes along and says, &quot;I think you were the victim in this.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>Have you heard of this subreddit r/cringe? It&#x2019;s where people post videos they&#x2019;ve found of other people doing unselfaware, embarrassing stuff for everyone to look at and pick it apart.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.q"> Isn&#x2019;t it terrible that of this Garden of Eden of the Internet is full of these mutated plants? I hate to be such a moralist, but if you&#x2019;d been on the kind of journey I&#x2019;ve been on the last couple of years you honestly would find it harder to go on those kinds of sites.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>Where does the Internet&#x2019;s perverse fascination with people embarrassing themselves come from though?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.s"> Part of it is the separation from reality. I tried in this book to narrow that space to nothing, and say this is what it feels like and it&#x2019;s incredibly anxiety-inducing to read. I deliberately wrote it so that people feel the agony. It kind of reads like a horror movie at times because you&#x2019;re feeling what it feels like to be Jonah Lehrer at that moment of exposure.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>I think we should only be allowed the Internet once a week.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.u"> I did a story on the Ku Klux Klan trying to do an image makeover and they were only allowed one cross burning a year. So maybe that&#x2019;s what we should do.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>When you think about what happened to Justine Sacco, it&#x2019;s not so different from a cross burning.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.w"> The bad result of them only having one cross burning a year was that they were really rusty and they couldn&#x2019;t remember anything. So one of my favorite memories of that day was all of them standing around the cross because they couldn&#x2019;t work out what to do, and then the leader came over and they all said &quot;Tom, Tom, do we soak it in kerosene and then raise it or do we raise it and then soak it?&quot; And he said &quot;You soak it and then raise it. How are you going to soak it once you&#x2019;ve raised it?&quot; And then he kind of looked at me as if to say,<em> I&#x2019;m so sorry my members are such idiots</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>So what&#x2019;s the worst side effect of all this public shaming?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.y"> It&#x2019;s very destructive to society and I think it&#x2019;s created a conformist, conservative, fearful surveillance society, like the Stasi, and nobody wants to live in a Stasi state, and that&#x2019;s the world we&#x2019;re quite literally living in. I really don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m overreaching when I say that.</p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>It seems like part of the reason people are so disconnected from politics right now is that it&#x2019;s impossible to relate to politicians who have to be so incredibly squeaky clean in order to get elected. Do you think those two things are related?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.4.10"> Yes. Obviously that&#x2019;s untenable, because you can&#x2019;t have a situation where nobody can ever be elected president. So that has to change too. What I&#x2019;m advocating for in this book is a world where everyone is allowed to be a little bit flawed. I&#x2019;m not advocating for everyone be offensive. I feel the same way about that as everybody else. But I think people should be more forgiving about other people&#x2019;s mistakes. Not pretending to believe somebody is the worst tweet they ever wrote. The world has to go that way because eventually we&#x2019;re all going to be shamed.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".auldqncdts.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
