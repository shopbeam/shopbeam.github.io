  	    "articleBody": "One of Amy Schumer\u0027s many comedic gifts is the way she has turned oversharing into a majestic art. And although her offstage (or off-camera) demeanor is far more reserved, the words that come out are not. I have known her for less than two minutes when, in response to some awkward small-talk question about her day so far, she tells me: \u0022I had my annual Pap smear. I got to go back to annual Paps because there\u0027s no HPV detectable in my system. We\u0022—she and her gynecologist—\u0022had a lot of laughs. She kind of got something stuck in her throat while she was examining me, but from where I was sitting, it seemed like she was kind of gagging looking at my vagina. But it\u0027s always nice to see her.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis doesn\u0027t feel to me like a stunt or some kind of bravado—just that I have asked a question, and she can see no reason not to give the answer. That credo—that the full contours of life, including all its awkwardness, messiness, and occasional dark places, are nothing to hide from—appears central to both her comedy and how she prefers to live.\u000A\u000AHow hard is it to be funny? \u000A\u000AI think it\u0027s different for everybody. It\u0027s not hard for me to be funny. But it\u0027s really hard. I don\u0027t think a lot of people are funny. I meet a lot of people, and most of them aren\u0027t funny.\u000A\u000AWhen you started doing stand-up, how quickly did you realize what kinds of things you were going to talk about?\u000A\u000AAbout five or six years in.\u000A\u000AAnd what were they?\u000A\u000AProviding a voice for women that was palatable for men also. An honest, unapologetic human voice. I was, \u0022I\u0027m not going to shy away from doing it, I\u0027m going to say the stuff that makes me unappealing.\u0022 I chose to do that.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWhat was the stuff that made you seem unappealing?\u000A\u000A[laughs] Um, the fact that I let a cabdriver finger me? (1) Eating habits. Talking about sex—just broaching the subject makes people think of you a certain way.\u000A\u000AWell, taking the cabdriver story as an example: Was it fun to talk about that? Or was it really uncomfortable, but that was part of what made it worth doing?\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s, um…it\u0027s a shameful tale. I mean, I\u0027m not proud of that. I felt really awful after that and I was worried for myself that I was gonna act out like that more. At that age, 19 and 20, I acted out, but I didn\u0027t after that.\u000A\u000ABut most people have things they\u0027re deeply ashamed about, even if that is a particularly vivid example, and I think most people lock those things in a box and hope that no one ever finds the key.\u000A\u000ARight. But I\u0027m putting it out there because it makes me feel better, it makes other people feel better. The first time I ever said it was on the radio, but the way I talk about it in my [stand-up] special years ago, it\u0027s a story I told at a baby shower. Which I did. Well, it was a bachelorette party. I didn\u0027t like how fake those women were—I just can\u0027t stand that. That pretend existence. It bugs me. The girl whose party it was was mad at me, and the other women were really uncomfortable. Like, no one laughed. It\u0027s fun to just keep being yourself when the room\u0027s demanding otherwise. I\u0027m putting my dirty laundry out there, and I don\u0027t want to be around people who pretend they don\u0027t have any.\u000A\u000AAnd when you nonetheless run into people like that…?\u000A\u000AI act out. I say horrible things. [laughs] It really brings out the worst in me. I\u0027m, like, don\u0027t invite me anywhere if you don\u0027t want me to be an asshole.\u000A\u000AIs anyone still encouraging you to be someone you\u0027re not?\u000A\u000AOh, every day of my life. Always. I\u0027ve always had my wrist slapped for being myself.\u000A\u000AWho is doing the slapping?\u000A\u000ATeachers. Parents. Restaurant managers. Some friends that have come and gone. Some boyfriends that have come and gone. And now [laughs] studios.\u000A\u000AWhat has set them off recently?\u000A\u000A[considers] Honestly, all the stuff I thought I might get in trouble for, I\u0027ve been praised for. It\u0027s just in rooms—I\u0027ll say what I really think but people think I\u0027m joking. So I\u0027m talking to one of the heads of, I think it was NBCUniversal, and I\u0027m like, \u0022Excuse me, I want to go talk to someone who\u0027s fun.\u0022 Like just a total asshole. And they\u0027re [acts delightfully amused] \u0022Oh! There she goes!\u0022 But it\u0027s really what I\u0027m thinking.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWe have met for afternoon tea at a favorite haunt of hers, Alice\u0027s Tea Cup on New York\u0027s Upper West Side. Its sister restaurant also appears as a location in her forthcoming movie, Trainwreck, a partly autobiographical tale of a woman named Amy with a messy family background and dysfunctional dating habits who, almost despite herself, realizes she might be in love.\u000A\u000AThe evening before we meet, the latest episode of Inside Amy Schumer has aired, her Comedy Central show that has grown over its three seasons into a titanically smart, weird, and hilarious skewering of our modern idiocies. This season\u0027s highlights: an episode-long remake of 12 Angry Men in which the jury debates \u0022Is Amy Schumer hot enough to be on TV?,\u0022 a Friday Night Lights parody in which a new coach scandalizes town and team with his new \u0022no raping\u0022 rule, and a picnic at which famous actresses (Tina Fey, Patricia Arquette, Julia Louis-Dreyfus) commemorate their \u0022last fuckable day.\u0022 Last night\u0027s centerpiece was a memorable Bill Cosby sketch in which she plays an attorney defending the beloved comedian. \u0022We worked so hard trying to figure that scene out,\u0022 she says. \u0022I originally pitched it: ‘What if it\u0027s a support group for women who\u0027ve been raped, and they won\u0027t say who did it, but they\u0027re all wearing Cosby sweaters and eating Jell-O?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ADo you hope he sees it?\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t care. I think he\u0027s so far… [She lets the thought trail off.] I guess I do hope people see it who are vilifying the women coming forward just so they can enjoy The Cosby Show still.\u000A\u000AEven though this season on your show you\u0027re not fundamentally doing anything different…\u000A\u000ANo, not at all.\u000A\u000A…it also seems like you\u0027ve hit a new, confident streak, as though you\u0027ve all kind of realized what this show can be.\u000A\u000AI mean, we always just have a little message or a comment in everything, but we did embrace that more this year. People being so receptive to it was a total, total surprise.\u000A\u000AIs that unequivocally a good thing, or is there any danger in that?\u000A\u000AI truly feel I\u0027m getting a lot of attention right now and it\u0027s just a ticking time bomb. Like, I wonder what the thing is going to be that will make people want to burn me at the stake. There\u0027s no way to control it. I think it will be really arbitrary and a misunderstanding. But yeah, I\u0027m really enjoying the love right now.\u000A\u000ABut you think the bonfire\u0027s already built, the stake ready?\u000A\u000AI think I\u0027ve got another couple months.\u000A\u000AYou genuinely think there\u0027s a danger?\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a certainty, yeah.\u000A\u000AWhy?\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s how it is. Because I\u0027m not going to shut up. And I think people only want women to speak for so long. They build you up, and then they\u0027re just ready to tear you down. Like Hillary—when it\u0027s really go time for her, I\u0027ll definitely be active, and that\u0027ll make people hate me. I know inevitably I\u0027ll get more political, just as an adult with changing interests, which is good—no one wants to hear me talk about who I fucked or whatever for another twenty years. And I hope I\u0027m wrong, but I just think there\u0027s this \u0022Don\u0027t disappoint me in any way.\u0022 If you say one joke that offends, it feels like, \u0022Oh, wait, I thought you were my everything, and now you\u0027re dead to me.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou met Hillary Clinton recently, right?\u000A\u000AA couple of months ago, Glamour Women of the Year, but I\u0027ve always been a fan. It was very cool. She was a good audience member—she commented on a couple of the jokes I told. I said that in L.A. my arms register as legs, and she really liked that. She was, \u0022I can relate.\u0022 And one of the acts that had gone up before me did some stuff that was very disrespectful to her, and I definitely didn\u0027t think it was funny, and I said to her, like, \u0022What the fuck was that?\u0022 She just goes, \u0022Par for the course.... I\u0027m so used to it.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022The stand-up I\u0027ve done on TV is like pulling back the curtain, and this HBO special is like pulling up my dress.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000AYou really think it\u0027s true that people are only prepared to listen to women for so long?\u000A\u000AYeah. You don\u0027t agree?\u000A\u000AI hoped things weren\u0027t that bad.\u000A\u000AI think it\u0027s that bad. I\u0027ve opened for male comics for years and see the difference in the treatment. It\u0027s the expectation of how a woman is going to be, or should be: Be sweet and likable and apologize for stealing oxygen from the world. Just be a pleasure and service whatever the experience is. And it\u0027s \u0022What a cunt—did you just hear her ask for that thing she\u0027s supposed to have?\u0022 All I\u0027ve ever wanted is to be treated like a comedian who\u0027s performing at your venue, who sold it out. Just talk to me how you would talk to Bill Burr, who was here the week before me. Like Patton Oswalt, who\u0027ll be here next week.\u000A\u000AObviously the 12 Angry Men episode was a kind of masterpiece.\u000A\u000AI had that idea and all of a sudden I was really excited about the third season. It was a scene that I would say I wrote 90 percent on because I don\u0027t want the [show\u0027s other] writers to go home and think of ways to insult me. I don\u0027t want to be handed a new insecurity: \u0022Oh, you didn\u0027t know something\u0027s wrong with your knees?\u0022 I worked really fucking hard on it. It got to me after hours and hours, but I was laughing the whole time, thinking about Paul Giamatti saying, \u0022Her ass makes me furious.\u0022 [laughs] It was empowering, to put all those insults about myself out there. I love being in my own skin, and I hope other women start feeling better about themselves and waste less energy being ashamed of their bodies.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve often expressed a general feeling that it sucks to be a female.\u000A\u000AYeah. It fucking sucks. It\u0027s exhausting. I\u0027m very annoyed by all the physical stuff—the heels, the makeup, outfits, versus my male counterparts who are rolling out of bed. Women are accomplishing more and more, and men are plateauing, so there are these insane expectations of how you\u0027ll be. You really are kind of encouraged to accomplish everything, and then you get to realize, \u0022But not too much—make everybody comfortable.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat have been the consequences for you?\u000A\u000AA couple of broken relationships. If you look at most female comedians doing well, they\u0027re alone. I think Wanda [Sykes] has been with her wife for a while, and Ellen.\u000A\u000AWhy do you think most of them are alone?\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s really hard for a lot of men to have the woman accomplishing more than them. And I don\u0027t want to date an actor. And the only comedians doing as well as me… I don\u0027t want to date Aziz or Louis [laughs]—they definitely don\u0027t want to date me—and everybody else is married.\u000A\u000AHave you ever wished you were a man?\u000A\u000ANo. That\u0027s disgusting. [laughs]\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWe are meeting two days before she is scheduled to film her first HBO stand-up special, a sign of anointment in modern comedy. And hers is to be directed by the master of such specials, Chris Rock. She has been on tour, honing her set in preparation, though also preparing to say good-bye to it; the convention these days among her contemporaries is that once a joke has been said on a TV special, it is used up.\u000A\u000AReading your previous interviews, it occurs to me that I can\u0027t think of anyone else who regularly feels the need to explain, \u0022I haven\u0027t done anal.\u0022\u000A\u000ATrue. That\u0027s very true. There\u0027s no one else where that would come up. I don\u0027t think Ellen or Carrot Top is going to be declaring that to anyone.\u000A\u000ATo massively oversimplify, there seem to be two themes running through what you do. The first is the incredibly disappointing ways in which men behave.\u000A\u000ASorry! [laughs] What\u0027s the other one?\u000A\u000AThe disappointing ways in which women behave.\u000A\u000AYeah.\u000A\u000AThe second being much more about how women are complicit in shit that happens.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s fair to say. I think it\u0027s more like a worldview. Like 12 Angry Men—forcview the world, it\u0027s really this is how people… because I think women are just as guilty of it.\u000A\u000ASo the overall moral is that people are terrible?\u000A\u000AYes. People are terrible, and I\u0027m one of them. Maybe we\u0027ll be a little bit more aware of it.\u000A\u000AAre you ready for the HBO filming?\u000A\u000AYes, I am. I\u0027ve been working my ass off. I feel the strongest I\u0027ve ever felt. I\u0027m excited about it. And I\u0027m going to miss saying those jokes. Chris—I might get emotional talking about it [her eyes tear up even as she says this]—getting to drive around with Chris Rock and have him give me notes on my set. My Make-A-Wish would be to have that.\u000A\u000AHe started coming to see you and giving you advice even before he was the director?\u000A\u000AYeah. He just does that for some of his friends. For Aziz and Louis. And then I just texted him: \u0022Will you direct it?\u0022 He was, \u0022It\u0027s possible.\u0022 And then he called me and said, \u0022Let\u0027s do it.\u0022 I started jumping up and down in my hotel, screaming.\u000A\u000AHow is this set different from what you\u0027ve shown on TV before?\u000A\u000AI\u0027m just a stronger comic. I think I have more of a pointed message. My special, Mostly Sex Stuff, and the stand-up I\u0027ve done on TV, is like pulling back the curtain, and this special\u0027s like pulling up my dress. [pause] That\u0027s a good description. Maybe I\u0027ll say that. I don\u0027t know—it\u0027s the point I want to make right now.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s the point?\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t know. There\u0027s lots of different points. That we\u0027re all human. No one\u0027s better than anybody. We all have stuff excreting from our dying bodies. [laughs] It\u0027s a feel-good show.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AUpon arriving at Alice\u0027s Tea Cup, Schumer announces her plan to indulge with gusto—\u0022I\u0027m going to get a Thanksgiving amount of courses\u0022—and she follows through. Over the next two hours, she orders tea with honey and cream, broccoli-and-white-bean soup, a ham-and-Gruyère sandwich (\u0022with no ham and no mayo\u0022), a chocolate-espresso scone, and a strawberry-lime scone. She picks at the scones, only taking those parts she wants and discarding the rest; she accurately describes the scattered remnants at one point as looking like something that\u0027s been \u0022ravaged by a raccoon.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat made you laugh when you were a kid?\u000A\u000AThe Muppets. I really liked when Miss Piggy was violent and Kermit being kind of a victim. It just made me laugh. I already had some sense that she was kind of breaking gender stereotypes, and just her sort of narcissism—she\u0027s kind of like Jane Krakowski in that it doesn\u0027t even occur to her that she\u0027s not the most gorgeous creature in the whole world, and just controls things and makes them her way.\u000A\u000AI know you\u0027ve mentioned that you felt put-upon when you were young by this notion that being funny was for the boys.\u000A\u000AYeah, I really got a sense: \u0022Just be quiet.\u0022 It was like there was this barrier before people laughed. It definitely felt like, \u0022You\u0027re a girl.\u0022\u000A\u000AHow did you know people weren\u0027t just trying to deter you because they thought you weren\u0027t funny?\u000A\u000A[laughs] That never occurred to me. Because some people were dying laughing, always. Teachers. I could make my family laugh. Then people start referring to you in a certain way, and it\u0027s kind of a known thing.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve mentioned quite a few things over the years that you\u0027ve auditioned for: The Wrestler [Evan Rachel Wood\u0027s part], Girls [to play Shoshanna], The Big Bang Theory. Is that just the tip of the iceberg?\u000A\u000AYeah. Every comedy. But thank God I didn\u0027t get those things.\u000A\u000AWere there any you really rued at the time?\u000A\u000AThe Wrestler was a heartbreak. Maybe I didn\u0027t have a fucking chance, but I was made to feel like I had a serious chance. I was supposed to be on Transparent, Jill Soloway\u0027s show, and just the scheduling didn\u0027t work out, and that still smarts. Carrie Brownstein\u0027s role. And what else just crushed me? The movie with Steve Carell and Jim Carrey where they\u0027re magicians.\u000A\u000AI never saw that.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re fine. But it was a really good role for a girl.\u000A\u000AWere there serious discussions about whether you were interested in taking over The Daily Show?\u000A\u000AYup.\u000A\u000AHow did they go?\u000A\u000AI\u0027m sitting here with you, not prepping to host The Daily Show.\u000A\u000AWhat was your first reaction?\u000A\u000AFucking honored. It was so nice for them to have that confidence in me, these people who know you really well getting behind you in a way you didn\u0027t think they would.\u000A\u000AAnd were you interested?\u000A\u000AI really thought about it. I really thought about it. But I want to do other things.\u000A\u000AWhat was the attraction of it?\u000A\u000AThat I would get to employ everyone in my family and employ everyone who\u0027s worked on the TV show with me, and keep us all together and safe for at least five years. And that is also what was the deterrent. I want to do stuff that scares me. Not that that wouldn\u0027t scare me, but I like not knowing what I\u0027m going to do. And I think Trevor will be amazing, and I\u0027m really glad they went with him.\u000A\u000ASo what do you think you\u0027ll spend those five years doing?\u000A\u000AI\u0027m going to gain ten pounds a year. I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve been getting some weird, exciting offers lately. I might shoot this other movie my sister and I just rewrote. It\u0027s an action movie. I really like the idea of working with women right now. [pause] Uh, I think of Paul Feig [its producer] as a woman.\u000A\u000AAnything else?\u000A\u000AMaybe write a book. I had a whole deal, but I decided to wait—I thought I would make more money if I waited. Autobiographical essays. It\u0027ll be darker than the wonderful ones we\u0027re used to. I\u0027ve already written a good amount of it. Some of it\u0027s really funny, I think, and then some of it\u0027s not funny. Bad shit happened, and I wrote exactly what happened. And it\u0027s cool that I\u0027m in the position I\u0027m in, because I think now I\u0027ll have the freedom to put that in there without an editor saying, \u0022Can you just make a list of, like, the top ten things to bring on vacation?\u0022 People do want to turn me into, I don\u0027t know…Carrie Bradshaw?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIn \u0027Trainwreck,\u0027 Schumer plays a writer at a men\u0027s magazine. (2) A couple of years ago, Judd Apatow contacted Schumer and suggested that they meet after hearing her on Howard Stern\u0027s radio show; at the end of that meeting, he asked her to let him know if she had any movie ideas. She did, a high-concept one that she then wrote and sent to him. He encouraged her to set that aside and write something more personal. That is how she found her way to Trainwreck, in which her life of chaotic hedonism is challenged when she starts to fall in love with a sports surgeon she is profiling, played by Bill Hader.\u000A\u000A\u0022I just started out writing scenes, just some things that had happened,\u0022 she says. \u0022Like, I\u0027ve only had one one-night stand in my life, so I kinda wrote out exactly what happened.\u0022 Meanwhile, real life intervened. \u0022I fell in love. I was falling in love with a guy.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhile you were writing?\u000A\u000AYeah. We were falling in love, and I was scared. It wasn\u0027t even fun—I wasn\u0027t even enjoying it because I was so scared, and I noticed that. That\u0027s not something I\u0027d noticed before. I thought of falling in love as this fun alternate-type state where you\u0027re just like on Ecstasy. But it\u0027s like being on Ecstasy but you can\u0027t come down, and you\u0027re afraid that the person\u0027s going to tear your heart out.\u000A\u000AWhat kind of guy was this?\u000A\u000AWell, I\u0027m flypaper to narcissists, so he fit that mold. And a sex addict, I found out, which is always really fun at first. You think you\u0027re so hot.\u000A\u000AHe was actually being treated for being a sex addict?\u000A\u000AYeah.\u000A\u000AAt what point did he mention that?\u000A\u000AA couple of months in. We were walking to a party together, and he told me. I think he fancied himself like an amazing, interesting, incredible person. Like, \u0022Here\u0027s another piece to my amazing puzzle.\u0022 As a girl, you\u0027re always looking for what the deal breaker\u0027s going to be, and it was, \u0022Oh…all right.\u0022 But I mean, a lot of the guys I\u0027m friends with are narcissists and sex addicts. Most of my friends are comedians.\u000A\u000ABut you ended that relationship?\u000A\u000AYeah.\u000A\u000AHow long after his declaration?\u000A\u000AAbout a couple of weeks.\u000A\u000ABut it provided the inspiration for what you were writing?\u000A\u000AIt was, \u0022What if this guy hadn\u0027t been a sex addict?\u0022 It was really hard to write Bill\u0027s character, because…what guy would be good for me? I had to really think about it.\u000A\u000AWas it just instinct to keep so much of the movie as a kind of parallel version of your own life?\u000A\u000AYeah. I would say 30 percent of the movie is probably just straight from my life, and the rest is some sort of exaggeration.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s directly from your life?\u000A\u000AMy dad. (3) A good amount of the dynamic with my sister. I mean, there\u0027s things layered throughout.\u000A\u000AHas your father seen it?\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s seen the scenes with his character. He loves it.\u000A\u000ABecause while ultimately very loving and affectionate, it\u0027s a pretty brutal portrayal of someone.\u000A\u000AYeah. It\u0027s accurate.\u000A\u000ASo what does he think about being portrayed like that?\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t think it\u0027s an unsympathetic look at him. My dad is hilarious, loves me and my sister to death, and he\u0027s done the best he can, but this is who he is. And he can be mean sometimes. I just love him—I made the decision that I\u0027m going to be the one who loves you no matter what. I\u0027m the only one who visits him. And he can be a complete bastard. He couldn\u0027t deny that. But he loves that he\u0027s in the movie.\u000A\u000AWhy doesn\u0027t anyone else go and see him?\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s really fucking sad, some days. He lives in a hospital room and can\u0027t walk at all right now. Everyone else who lives in the hospital is in their nineties (4) and just almost catatonic. Some days it\u0027s totally not sad, when you have a good visit. I don\u0027t know—he\u0027s not always a sweetheart. Kim (5) and I went out there to watch the season premiere of my TV show last year and he was very drugged up and out of it, and he was trying to pee into a little jar thing and it fell. That\u0027s the kind of darkness that was in our house early where it just makes us laugh. We\u0027re just going back to Manhattan, just looking at each other, laughing so hard, because it\u0027s so awful, it\u0027s so fucking horrible.\u000A\u000AHow does that feed into your comedy?\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t know. The truth hurts. I like to look at the really dark true parts of things. The truly horrible is always what\u0027s made me laugh the most.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAs this impromptu tea party winds up, she announces that she plans to spend the evening with her sister, watching House of Cards. \u0022Just going to spoon her dog,\u0022 she says. Later she posts a short Instagram video online of her doing just that, with the caption \u0022Boyfriend.\u0022\u000A\u000ATwo days later, I watch her do the first of two shows at the Apollo for her special. She comes onstage swigging from a bottle of white wine. (6) It goes very well, but after the second show she declines to have an afterparty. Instead, she goes back to her apartment with her brother and her sister, where they eat Sylvia\u0027s fried chicken and drink scotch until five in the morning: \u0022We talked shit about our parents, we listened to music, we all cried a little bit.\u0022 That\u0027s where I find her the following afternoon, hungover but ready to talk some more.\u000A\u000AHow did you feel once it was over?\u000A\u000AEmotional. The second show, it was like saying good-bye to a lot of those jokes. But now I have nothing. I\u0027m back at zero. I have no jokes now.\u000A\u000AWere there any you were glad to be done with?\u000A\u000AA couple. It was like sending them off to sea. Viking funeral.\u000A\u000AThere were quite a few things I\u0027d never heard before. It was memorable to hear Gandhi and Oprah described as \u0022come.\u0022 (7)\u000A\u000AI wrote that two days ago.\u000A\u000AWhat was the train of thought that led you to that?\u000A\u000AJust how people are so grossed out just hearing that word, but that\u0027s how we have babies. I think I said, \u0022Oprah was come,\u0022 and then Chris [Rock] said, \u0022Gandhi was come,\u0022 and we just both were laughing really hard about that.\u000A\u000AHave you been doing Michelle Obama\u0027s post-coital walk for a long time? (8) That\u0027s certainly memorable, too.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s been in my act a couple of months. Yeah, I wonder if it\u0027ll reach her.\u000A\u000AWhat do you think she\u0027ll think?\u000A\u000AI like to think that she would just go, [wearily horrified] \u0022Oh God…\u0022 Best-case scenario.\u000A\u000ASurely the best-case scenario would be: \u0022Amy Schumer\u0027s really expressed something essential and true about being a woman.\u0022\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t think that\u0027ll happen. Dream-world scenario? [mimes phone ringing] Caller ID blocked. \u0022Hello… I loved… Come over…\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd worst-case…?\u000A\u000ADeeply offended. I don\u0027t see that, though. I don\u0027t want her to be deeply offended. I mean, I\u0027m sure she wouldn\u0027t really want somebody to be thinking of her going to the bathroom and cleaning the come out of her vagina, but it does really drive home the point. [considers a moment] Unless she has someone for that. Like a come assistant.\u000A\u000AThe most conflicted reaction in the room seemed to be when you said the Rihanna line. (9)\u000A\u000AYeah. I promised Chris I would try that one, one show. That was his addition. That won\u0027t be in the final cut, but I promised him I would try it, so I did.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADo you know what you might call the special yet?\u000A\u000AI think Amy at the Apollo. I was, \u0022How about Schumer at the Apollo?\u0022 and Chris was: \u0022Nobody wants to fuck Schumer. They want to fuck Amy.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASchumer has explained that when she was just out of her teens, sitting in the front seat of a New York cab at the end of a long night with a drunken friend asleep in the back, she directed the driver to finger her to orgasm, then paid the fare as normal at the end of the journey.Schumer talked to people from GQ while she was writing the movie. And perhaps to flaunt the insight she\u0027s acquired into the rules and mores of a modern men\u0027s magazine, she\u0027ll tell me at one point during this first meeting: \u0022Because I\u0027m on the cover, you can\u0027t write a piece where you\u0027re like, ‘This fucking cunt walked in.… This dumb bitch walked in.\u0027 \u0022In the movie and in life, her father—called Gordon in both instances, just as she is called Amy in both—has MS and is in a nursing home.Gordon Schumer is only 64. Which is why, in the movie, he can be played by Colin Quinn.Amy\u0027s younger sister and writing partner (each episode of Inside Amy Schumer concludes with a photo of them together), who on this occasion clearly agreed to visit, too.It\u0027s real wine: Rombauer Chardonnay. \u0022Me and my friend Bridget Everett, we\u0027re always trying to get them to sponsor us, because it\u0027s this Chardonnay we really like,\u0022 she\u0027ll explain to me, \u0022and they just send us two bottles and are like, ‘Shhh…\u0027 They want nothing to do with us—it\u0027s so rude.\u0022In a section of the show where Schumer suggests we should have more respect for come, given that every one of us is originally from it.Schumer staggers across stage, miming how she imagines Michelle Obama after her weekly sex session, trying to keep everything inside until she gets to the bathroom.Schumer relays dating advice from her mother: \u0022 ‘You need to love like you\u0027ve never been hurt.…\u0027 Like, did somebody say that to Rihanna?\u0022",

And although her offstage (or off-camera) demeanor is far more reserved, the words that come out are not. I have known her for less than two minutes when, in response to some awkward small-talk question about her day so far, she tells me: &quot;I had my annual Pap smear. I got to go back to annual Paps because there&apos;s no HPV detectable in my system. We&quot;&#x2014;she and her gynecologist&#x2014;&quot;had a lot of laughs. She kind of got something stuck in her throat while she was examining me, but from where I was sitting, it seemed like she was kind of gagging looking at my vagina. But it&apos;s always nice to see her.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.1">This doesn&apos;t feel to me like a stunt or some kind of bravado&#x2014;just that I have asked a question, and she can see no reason not to give the answer. That credo&#x2014;that the full contours of life, including all its awkwardness, messiness, and occasional dark places, are nothing to hide from&#x2014;appears central to both her comedy and how she prefers to live.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>How hard is it to be funny?</strong> </p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.3">I think it&apos;s different for everybody. It&apos;s not hard for me to be funny. But it&apos;s really hard. I don&apos;t think a lot of people are funny. I meet a lot of people, and most of them aren&apos;t funny.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>When you started doing stand-up, how quickly did you realize what kinds of things you were going to talk about?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.6">About five or six years in.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>And what were they?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.8">Providing a voice for women that was palatable for men also.

(1) Eating habits. Talking about sex&#x2014;just broaching the subject makes people think of you a certain way.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Well, taking the cabdriver story as an example: Was it fun to talk about that? Or was it really uncomfortable, but that was part of what made it worth doing?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.d">It&apos;s, um&#x2026;it&apos;s a shameful tale. I mean, I&apos;m not proud of that. I felt really awful after that and I was worried for myself that I was gonna act out like that more. At that age, 19 and 20, I acted out, but I didn&apos;t after that.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>But most people have things they&apos;re deeply ashamed about, even if that is a particularly vivid example, and I think most people lock those things in a box and hope that no one ever finds the key.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.f">Right. But I&apos;m putting it out there because it makes me feel better, it makes other people feel better. The first time I ever said it was on the radio, but the way I talk about it in my [stand-up] special years ago, it&apos;s a story I told at a baby shower. Which I did. Well, it was a bachelorette party. I didn&apos;t like how fake those women were&#x2014;I just can&apos;t stand that. That pretend existence. It bugs me. The girl whose party it was was mad at me, and the other women were really uncomfortable. Like, no one laughed. It&apos;s fun to just keep being yourself when the room&apos;s demanding otherwise. I&apos;m putting my dirty laundry out there, and I don&apos;t want to be around people who pretend they don&apos;t have any.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>And when you nonetheless run into people like that&#x2026;?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.h">I act out. I say horrible things. <em>[laughs]</em> It really brings out the worst in me. I&apos;m, like, don&apos;t invite me anywhere if you don&apos;t want me to be an asshole.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Is anyone still encouraging you to be someone you&apos;re not?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.j">Oh, every day of my life. Always. I&apos;ve always had my wrist slapped for being myself.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Who is doing the slapping?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.l">Teachers.

It&apos;s just in rooms&#x2014;I&apos;ll say what I really think but people think I&apos;m joking. So I&apos;m talking to one of the heads of, I think it was NBCUniversal, and I&apos;m like, &quot;Excuse me, I want to go talk to someone who&apos;s fun.&quot; Like just a total asshole.

Its sister restaurant also appears as a location in her forthcoming movie, <em>Trainwreck,</em> a partly autobiographical tale of a woman named Amy with a messy family background and dysfunctional dating habits who, almost despite herself, realizes she might be in love.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.q">The evening before we meet, the latest episode of <em>Inside Amy Schumer</em> has aired, her Comedy Central show that has grown over its three seasons into a titanically smart, weird, and hilarious skewering of our modern idiocies. This season&apos;s highlights: an episode-long remake of <em>12 Angry Men</em> in which the jury debates &quot;Is Amy Schumer hot enough to be on TV?,&quot; a <em>Friday Night Lights</em> parody in which a new coach scandalizes town and team with his new &quot;no raping&quot; rule, and a picnic at which famous actresses (Tina Fey, Patricia Arquette, Julia Louis-Dreyfus) commemorate their &quot;last fuckable day.&quot; Last night&apos;s centerpiece was a memorable Bill Cosby sketch in which she plays an attorney defending the beloved comedian. &quot;We worked so hard trying to figure that scene out,&quot; she says. &quot;I originally pitched it: &#x2018;What if it&apos;s a support group for women who&apos;ve been raped, and they won&apos;t say who did it, but they&apos;re all wearing Cosby sweaters and eating Jell-O?&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>Do you hope he sees it?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.s">I don&apos;t care. I think he&apos;s so far&#x2026; <em>[She lets the thought trail off.]</em> I guess I do hope people see it who are vilifying the women coming forward just so they can enjoy <em>The Cosby Show</em> still.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>Even though this season on your show you&apos;re not fundamentally doing anything different&#x2026;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.u">No, not at all.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>&#x2026;it also seems like you&apos;ve hit a new, confident streak, as though you&apos;ve all kind of realized what this show can be.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.w">I mean, we always just have a little message or a comment in everything, but we did embrace that more this year. People being so receptive to it was a total, total surprise.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>Is that unequivocally a good thing, or is there any danger in that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.y">I truly feel I&apos;m getting a lot of attention right now and it&apos;s just a ticking time bomb. Like, I wonder what the thing is going to be that will make people want to burn me at the stake. There&apos;s no way to control it. I think it will be really arbitrary and a misunderstanding. But yeah, I&apos;m really enjoying the love right now.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>But you think the bonfire&apos;s already built, the stake ready?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.10">I think I&apos;ve got another couple months.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong>You genuinely think there&apos;s a danger?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.12">It&apos;s a certainty, yeah.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>Why?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.14">That&apos;s how it is. Because I&apos;m not going to shut up. And I think people only want women to speak for so long. They build you up, and then they&apos;re just ready to tear you down. Like Hillary&#x2014;when it&apos;s really go time for her, I&apos;ll definitely be active, and that&apos;ll make people hate me. I know inevitably I&apos;ll get more political, just as an adult with changing interests, which is good&#x2014;no one wants to hear me talk about who I fucked or whatever for another twenty years. And I hope I&apos;m wrong, but I just think there&apos;s this &quot;Don&apos;t disappoint me in any way.&quot; If you say one joke that offends, it feels like, &quot;Oh, wait, I thought you were my everything, and now you&apos;re dead to me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>You met Hillary Clinton recently, right?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.16">A couple of months ago, <em>Glamour</em> Women of the Year, but I&apos;ve always been a fan. It was very cool. She was a good audience member&#x2014;she commented on a couple of the jokes I told. I said that in L.A. my arms register as legs, and she really liked that. She was, &quot;I can relate.&quot; And one of the acts that had gone up before me did some stuff that was very disrespectful to her, and I definitely didn&apos;t think it was funny, and I said to her, like, &quot;What the fuck was that?&quot; She just goes, &quot;Par for the course....

You don&apos;t agree?</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.1a"><strong>I hoped things weren&apos;t that bad.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.1b">I think it&apos;s that bad. I&apos;ve opened for male comics for years and see the difference in the treatment. It&apos;s the expectation of how a woman is going to be, or should be: Be sweet and likable and apologize for stealing oxygen from the world. Just be a pleasure and service whatever the experience is. And it&apos;s &quot;What a cunt&#x2014;did you just hear her ask for that thing she&apos;s supposed to have?&quot; All I&apos;ve ever wanted is to be treated like a comedian who&apos;s performing at your venue, who sold it out. Just talk to me how you would talk to Bill Burr, who was here the week before me. Like Patton Oswalt, who&apos;ll be here next week.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><strong>Obviously the <em>12 Angry Men</em> episode was a kind of masterpiece.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.1d">I had that idea and all of a sudden I was really excited about the third season. It was a scene that I would say I wrote 90 percent on because I don&apos;t want the [show&apos;s other] writers to go home and think of ways to insult me. I don&apos;t want to be handed a new insecurity: &quot;Oh, you didn&apos;t know something&apos;s wrong with your knees?&quot; I worked really fucking hard on it. It got to me after hours and hours, but I was laughing the whole time, thinking about Paul Giamatti saying, &quot;Her ass makes me furious.&quot; <em>[laughs]</em> It was empowering, to put all those insults about myself out there. I love being in my own skin, and I hope other women start feeling better about themselves and waste less energy being ashamed of their bodies.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><strong>You&apos;ve often expressed a general feeling that it sucks to be a female.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.1f">Yeah. It fucking sucks. It&apos;s exhausting. I&apos;m very annoyed by all the physical stuff&#x2014;the heels, the makeup, outfits, versus my male counterparts who are rolling out of bed. Women are accomplishing more and more, and men are plateauing, so there are these insane expectations of how you&apos;ll be.

I think it&apos;s more like a worldview.

He just does that for some of his friends. For Aziz and Louis. And then I just texted him: &quot;Will you direct it?&quot; He was, &quot;It&apos;s possible.&quot; And then he called me and said, &quot;Let&apos;s do it.&quot; I started jumping up and down in my hotel, screaming.</p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.22"><strong>How is this set different from what you&apos;ve shown on TV before?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".z41vj9jmyo.1.1.0.0.4.23">I&apos;m just a stronger comic. I think I have more of a pointed message. My special, <em>Mostly Sex Stuff,</em> and the stand-up I&apos;ve done on TV, is like pulling back the curtain, and this special&apos;s like pulling up my dress. <em>[pause]</em> That&apos;s a good description.

She did, a high-concept one that she then wrote and sent to him. He encouraged her to set that aside and write something more personal.

That&apos;s not something I&apos;d noticed before. I thought of falling in love as this fun alternate-type state where you&apos;re just like on Ecstasy.

My dad is hilarious, loves me and my sister to death, and he&apos;s done the best he can, but this is who he is. And he can be mean sometimes. I just love him&#x2014;I made the decision that <em>I&apos;m going to be the one who loves you no matter what.</em> I&apos;m the only one who visits him. And he can be a complete bastard.
