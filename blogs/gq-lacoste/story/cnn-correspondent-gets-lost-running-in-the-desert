  	    "articleBody": "Training while traveling was complicated. I not only had to figure out routes in cities I barely knew, I also had to fit training in with schedules that might require 100 hours of work or more a week. In Vegas, where we\u0027d come to cover stories about the economy, everything was behind schedule. Each interview took twice as long as planned. Every place we visited took much longer to reach than we had budgeted, thanks to stop-and-go Strip traffic. As the day evaporated, I began hating the flashing lights, the gaudy casinos, and the mobs of tourists. In the morning I had visited a website for runners and picked out a wonderful trail in the wilderness. If only I could make it there.\u000A\u000AAs soon as we had our script finished and I had recorded my audio track, I bolted to the rental car and tore off to the west side of Vegas, winding toward a scenic area called Red Rock Canyon. The houses fell away, the countryside opened, and in 20 minutes I was pulling up to a magnificent southwestern scene of low desert brush, red rock formations, and rolling hills laced with fossils. \u000A\u000A\u0022Hi, how much to get into the park?\u0022 I asked the gate attendant, a senior citizen wearing a saggy uniform and a ranger\u0027s badge. His nametag said Dave.\u000A\u000A\u0022Seven dollars, but you don\u0027t want to pay that now.\u0022 \u000A\u000A\u0022Why?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022We\u0027re closing in five minutes.\u0022\u000A\u000AI started to pull away, then hesitated.\u000A\u0022Look, I\u0027m a runner. I\u0027m here on business and I just want a place to knock out a few miles. Do you have any suggestions?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, sure.\u0022  \u000A\u000A\u0022What?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Down the road here about a mile, you\u0027ll see a little pull-off. You can leave your car there and run up through the back entrance of the park for free. Only don\u0027t stay too long. It\u0027ll get dark fast once the sun is gone.\u0022\u000AMinutes later, I was running through the stunning valleys and canyons, grateful for Dave\u0027s advice. Jackrabbits kicked up among the scrub oaks and yuccas. Mounds of ghostly Aztec sandstone poked into the air. The mountains rose three thousand feet up into the dying light.\u000A\u000AThe road was smoothly paved and invitingly windy. Against the sense of deep history and the natural beauty here, Wayne Newton\u0027s nightly antics at the Tropicana, the helicopter rides, the escort services, machine-gun ranges, dancing fountains, and exploding pirate ships might as well have been on another planet. For a good hour I felt nothing but the wind, and heard nothing but faint birdcalls and my own steps. I cut off onto side trails as I saw fit. I watched the sky go pink, then purple, then dark blue, then...\u000A\u000AIt happened considerably quicker than I had expected.\u000AOne moment I was trotting along thinking I was due to head back.  The next instant, I\u0027d made the turn only to find twilight flooding the valley. The path I\u0027d just run was now a faint blur of darkness fading into the wilds of Nevada. Night was not falling; it was crashing down.  \u000A\u000A\u0022You should be carrying a phone on your runs,\u0022 my daughter had told me a few weeks earlier.\u000A\u0022Why? You think I\u0027m going to be attacked by raccoons?\u0022 \u0022I\u0027m serious. What are you going to do if you get into trouble out there one day?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ll be okay,\u0022 I\u0027d responded with the bravado of a father.\u000A\u000A\u0022She has a point,\u0022 my wife had added later. \u0022You\u0027re covering such distances now, do you realize how hard it would be for me to find you?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t want the extra weight. A phone slapping against my side the whole time? Come on. That would be miserable.\u0022\u000A\u0022Let me tell you, finding your carcass in the weeds by the highway won\u0027t be a picnic either. So, will you think about the phone?\u0022\u000AI had sighed. \u0022Sure. I\u0027ll think about it.\u0022\u000A\u000AAt this moment, I was wishing I had. I took stock and tried to keep calm. I\u0027d told my producer, Katie, where I was going in only the vaguest terms. No one knew where I was except Ranger Dave, and by now he was probably home eating soup and watching Golden Girls reruns. I\u0027d been running for well over an hour, so I had at least that far to go to reach the car, assuming I made no wrong turns—and in the growing dark, that was hardly guaranteed. Plus, the temperature was dropping.\u000AI can\u0027t count the number of stories I\u0027ve done over the years about people who set off to hike, picnic, camp, gather wood, or watch birds, only to wind up fighting for their lives at the hands of that cruel harpy, Mother Nature. The West is particularly fertile ground for such tales. The land is filled with sheer cliffs, crumbling escarpments, falling boulders, mine shafts, razor ridges, and mountains so massive that the wrong flank can be as isolated as the dark side of the moon. If you are lucky enough to get lost in a flat section, the advantage is minimal. The landscape is parched in most places, either full-on desert or something close to it. Thorny bushes, nettles, cacti, and other vicious plants abound. And then of course there\u0027s the possibility, however remote, of being throttled by a puma, poisoned by a snake, gored by a bison, or dragged to the ground by fang-baring, slit-eyed coyotes.\u000A\u000AThe result is a trail of carnage and despair for those who are unlucky enough to find themselves lost or stranded: As the light slipped away, it was all too easy to imagine myself joining elderly couples forced to live weeks on nothing but a box of Cheerios, families stuck in labyrinthine canyons so long that they eat their dogs, lovers eternally frozen in compromising positions, and untold numbers of runners who have just disappeared.\u000A\u000A\u0022God, am I stupid,\u0022 I said. It was a confession, prayer, and question all rolled into one. The longer I ran, the less I seemed to be going anywhere. There was almost no ambient light with which to gauge distance or progress. The road I\u0027d started on, by this time, was nothing but a rumor. I could feel a hard surface beneath my feet, but my steps were blind, and I feared I was on one of the side paths that led to parts unknown. \u000A\u000AI gauged the angle of the asphalt by impact, and guessed where my next step should fall. I knew I could easily miscalculate, break an ankle, and tumble off into a ravine.  If I went down out here I would not be found until the next day at the earliest, long after the cold and critters had done their worst.\u000A\u000AI could imagine Ranger Dave shaking his head, surrounded by the search party. \u0022Dang  fool. I told him not to stay too long. Looky there.  The varmints done chewed off his shoes!\u0022  I wondered if Wayne Newton would mention me in his show. \u0022You know, folks, I want to take a moment for a sad song. A song of remembrance...\u0022\u000A\u000AI dared not stop. My frantic scramble to get back to the car had sapped my energy and drenched my clothes. Every time I backed off, tempted to give in to fatigue, the high desert cold bit into my bones. Even at a dead run, I was shivering and wondering if the operative word would be just that: dead. The only thing I could see was the faint glow of Vegas on the horizon far to my left. That bawdy Brigadoon, with its clanging slots, all-you-can-eat buffets, octogenarians toting buckets of nickels, and past-due beauty queens with silicone boobs, seemed so lovely now, and I nearly wept at the idea that I might not make it back.\u000AThe minutes and miles kept passing. I pushed the button on my watch to trigger the luminous numbers, less to keep track of the time than for the comfort of seeing something that looked like civilization. Then my feet struck metal. I staggered, wobbled, and slipped into a crouch, my feet rolling weirdly.  I put a hand down and felt a smooth pole. A cattle crossing.\u000A\u000AA car\u0027s lights came over the hill so suddenly that I was blinded; then they swerved and swept away. I was right next to a highway. I looked back and forth in the blackness.  Another car came in the other direction, and in its lights I saw my own vehicle not more than fifty feet away.\u000A\u000AI have rarely enjoyed starting an automobile so much—the purr of the engine, the lights on the dash. I imagined this was the way an astronaut or deep-sea diver might feel upon returning from a doomed journey. I turned up the heat and the radio and rode back into Vegas, singing along with every song, glorying in every sight and sound.\u000A\u000AAdapted from My Year of Running Dangerously, out today from Blue Rider Press.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARead More:7 New Books to Celebrate the Arrival of Reading SeasonMeet Lauren Groff, Author of This Fall\u0027s Jaw-Dropper Novel",

data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.0">Training while traveling was complicated. I not only had to figure out routes in cities I barely knew, I also had to fit training in with schedules that might require 100 hours of work or more a week. In Vegas, where we&#x2019;d come to cover stories about the economy, everything was behind schedule. Each interview took twice as long as planned. Every place we visited took much longer to reach than we had budgeted, thanks to stop-and-go Strip traffic. As the day evaporated, I began hating the flashing lights, the gaudy casinos, and the mobs of tourists. In the morning I had visited a website for runners and picked out a wonderful trail in the wilderness. If only I could make it there.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.1">As soon as we had our script finished and I had recorded my audio track, I bolted to the rental car and tore off to the west side of Vegas, winding toward a scenic area called Red Rock Canyon. The houses fell away, the countryside opened, and in 20 minutes I was pulling up to a magnificent southwestern scene of low desert brush, red rock formations, and rolling hills laced with fossils. </p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#x201C;Hi, how much to get into the park?&#x201D; I asked the gate attendant, a senior citizen wearing a saggy uniform and a ranger&#x2019;s badge. His nametag said Dave.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.3">&#x201C;Seven dollars, but you don&#x2019;t want to pay that now.&#x201D; </p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.5">&#x201C;Why?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.6">&#x201C;We&#x2019;re closing in five minutes.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.7">I started to pull away, then hesitated.
&#x201C;Look, I&#x2019;m a runner. I&#x2019;m here on business and I just want a place to knock out a few miles. Do you have any suggestions?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.8">&#x201C;Oh, sure.&#x201D;  </p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.9">&#x201C;What?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.a">&#x201C;Down the road here about a mile, you&#x2019;ll see a little pull-off. You can leave your car there and run up through the back entrance of the park for free. Only don&#x2019;t stay too long. It&#x2019;ll get dark fast once the sun is gone.&#x201D;
Minutes later, I was running through the stunning valleys and canyons, grateful for Dave&#x2019;s advice. Jackrabbits kicked up among the scrub oaks and yuccas. Mounds of ghostly Aztec sandstone poked into the air. The mountains rose three thousand feet up into the dying light.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.b">The road was smoothly paved and invitingly windy. Against the sense of deep history and the natural beauty here, Wayne Newton&#x2019;s nightly antics at the Tropicana, the helicopter rides, the escort services, machine-gun ranges, dancing fountains, and exploding pirate ships might as well have been on another planet. For a good hour I felt nothing but the wind, and heard nothing but faint birdcalls and my own steps. I cut off onto side trails as I saw fit. I watched the sky go pink, then purple, then dark blue, then...</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.c">It happened considerably quicker than I had expected.
One moment I was trotting along thinking I was due to head back.  The next instant, I&#x2019;d made the turn only to find twilight flooding the valley. The path I&#x2019;d just run was now a faint blur of darkness fading into the wilds of Nevada. Night was not falling; it was crashing down.  </p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.d">&#x201C;You should be carrying a phone on your runs,&#x201D; my daughter had told me a few weeks earlier.
&#x201C;Why? You think I&#x2019;m going to be attacked by raccoons?&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;m serious. What are you going to do if you get into trouble out there one day?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.e">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be okay,&#x201D; I&#x2019;d responded with the bravado of a father.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.f">&#x201C;She has a point,&#x201D; my wife had added later. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re covering such distances now, do you realize how hard it would be for me to find you?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.g">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want the extra weight. A phone slapping against my side the whole time? Come on. That would be miserable.&#x201D;
&#x201C;Let me tell you, finding your carcass in the weeds by the highway won&#x2019;t be a picnic either. So, will you think about the phone?&#x201D;
I had sighed. &#x201C;Sure. I&#x2019;ll think about it.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.h">At this moment, I was wishing I had. I took stock and tried to keep calm. I&#x2019;d told my producer, Katie, where I was going in only the vaguest terms. No one knew where I was except Ranger Dave, and by now he was probably home eating soup and watching <em>Golden Girls</em> reruns. I&#x2019;d been running for well over an hour, so I had at least that far to go to reach the car, assuming I made no wrong turns&#x2014;and in the growing dark, that was hardly guaranteed. Plus, the temperature was dropping.
I can&#x2019;t count the number of stories I&#x2019;ve done over the years about people who set off to hike, picnic, camp, gather wood, or watch birds, only to wind up fighting for their lives at the hands of that cruel harpy, Mother Nature. The West is particularly fertile ground for such tales. The land is filled with sheer cliffs, crumbling escarpments, falling boulders, mine shafts, razor ridges, and mountains so massive that the wrong flank can be as isolated as the dark side of the moon. If you are lucky enough to get lost in a flat section, the advantage is minimal. The landscape is parched in most places, either full-on desert or something close to it. Thorny bushes, nettles, cacti, and other vicious plants abound. And then of course there&#x2019;s the possibility, however remote, of being throttled by a puma, poisoned by a snake, gored by a bison, or dragged to the ground by fang-baring, slit-eyed coyotes.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.i">The result is a trail of carnage and despair for those who are unlucky enough to find themselves lost or stranded: As the light slipped away, it was all too easy to imagine myself joining elderly couples forced to live weeks on nothing but a box of Cheerios, families stuck in labyrinthine canyons so long that they eat their dogs, lovers eternally frozen in compromising positions, and untold numbers of runners who have just disappeared.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.j">&#x201C;God, am I stupid,&#x201D; I said. It was a confession, prayer, and question all rolled into one. The longer I ran, the less I seemed to be going anywhere. There was almost no ambient light with which to gauge distance or progress. The road I&#x2019;d started on, by this time, was nothing but a rumor. I could feel a hard surface beneath my feet, but my steps were blind, and I feared I was on one of the side paths that led to parts unknown. </p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.k">I gauged the angle of the asphalt by impact, and guessed where my next step should fall. I knew I could easily miscalculate, break an ankle, and tumble off into a ravine.  If I went down out here I would not be found until the next day at the earliest, long after the cold and critters had done their worst.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.l">I could imagine Ranger Dave shaking his head, surrounded by the search party. &#x201C;<em>Dang  fool</em>. <em>I told him not to stay too long. Looky there.  The varmints done chewed off his shoes!&#x201D;</em>  I wondered if Wayne Newton would mention me in his show. <em>&#x201C;You know, folks, I want to take a moment for a sad song. A song of remembrance...&#x201D;</em></p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.m">I dared not stop. My frantic scramble to get back to the car had sapped my energy and drenched my clothes. Every time I backed off, tempted to give in to fatigue, the high desert cold bit into my bones. Even at a dead run, I was shivering and wondering if the operative word would be just that: dead. The only thing I could see was the faint glow of Vegas on the horizon far to my left. That bawdy Brigadoon, with its clanging slots, all-you-can-eat buffets, octogenarians toting buckets of nickels, and past-due beauty queens with silicone boobs, seemed so lovely now, and I nearly wept at the idea that I might not make it back.
The minutes and miles kept passing. I pushed the button on my watch to trigger the luminous numbers, less to keep track of the time than for the comfort of seeing something that looked like civilization. Then my feet struck metal. I staggered, wobbled, and slipped into a crouch, my feet rolling weirdly.  I put a hand down and felt a smooth pole. A cattle crossing.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.n">A car&#x2019;s lights came over the hill so suddenly that I was blinded; then they swerved and swept away. I was right next to a highway. I looked back and forth in the blackness.  Another car came in the other direction, and in its lights I saw my own vehicle not more than fifty feet away.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.o">I have rarely enjoyed starting an automobile so much&#x2014;the purr of the engine, the lights on the dash. I imagined this was the way an astronaut or deep-sea diver might feel upon returning from a doomed journey. I turned up the heat and the radio and rode back into Vegas, singing along with every song, glorying in every sight and sound.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr71t5u5fk.1.1.0.0.4.p"><em>Adapted from</em> My
