  	    "articleBody": "The first thing Ryan Reynolds would like you to know about having kids is: Don\u0027t listen to what Ryan Reynolds thinks about having kids. \u0022Picture advice being loaded into Super Soakers,\u0022 he says, grinning. He looks me up and down—I\u0027m 33, about to be married, on the brink of it. \u0022You\u0027re running around all dry and fancy-free—you\u0027re gonna be, like, drenched,\u0022 he warns me. \u0022The one piece of advice I would say is: Don\u0027t listen to any advice. Because there\u0027s nothing you can do to prepare for it.\u0022\u000A\u000AReynolds is 38 and on his eight or ninth Hollywood lifetime—he\u0027s been the cult-comedy guy from Van Wilder and the romantic-comedy guy from The Proposal and the guy in a CGI suit talking to a tennis ball in Green Lantern. He\u0027s been the next big thing more times than he can count. But right now his life can be summed up in far more elemental terms. There\u0027s the rustic house about an hour of north of New York City, where he and his wife, Blake Lively, have chosen to live and raise their daughter, James. And then there\u0027s the baby-monitor app on his iPhone, which buzzes every couple seconds as we sit upstairs in the renovated barn next to the main house. \u0022This is your future right here,\u0022 he says, showing me the cascade of alerts on his phone. James is 8 months old and about a hundred feet away, with her mother. And that\u0027s what\u0027s become of Ryan Reynolds.\u000A\u000APhotos: Ryan Reynolds Shows Us How To Be the Most Stylish Dad on the Block\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ve learned that an inordinate amount of clichés are completely true,\u0022 he says. \u0022Like, there is this kid here that I would walk through fire for. Or maybe not fire. Like, a very hot pavement, I\u0027d walk through. A shag rug.\u0022\u000A\u000AAre you the father you hoped you\u0027d be?\u000A\u000A\u0022I think I am, yeah. I can\u0027t say I had an easy relationship with my father, and I can\u0027t say my brothers did either, but I look at each of my older brothers, and they\u0027re all fathers, and they\u0027re all great fathers. So I had some good examples. But I don\u0027t think you really necessarily need examples. You just try to not be a complete pile of shit and just be there for them. You know, I like it: I mean that in the heaviest context. I genuinely like it. I like being a father. I like having a daughter. I would like to have more kids. You know, it seems to suit me pretty well.\u0022\u000A\u000ADid that surprise you?\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m surprised how patient I am with it. I feel like I could sometimes have a bit of a short fuse, but there\u0027s just been this weirdly endless supply of patience. I have no problem waking up five times in the middle of the night and changing diapers, and as exhausted as you get, I have this stupid grin on my face all the time. And that\u0027s not because I have a nanny or something like that. It\u0027s just us right now, and I love it.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou were talking about having complicated feelings about the way you were raised. Does having a kid change that?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, in a lot of different ways that I think are cool. One is that you become a lot more forgiving. Once you have a kid, you just think, like, ‘I can\u0027t believe that another person did all this shit for me, that I\u0027m doing for this person right now!\u0027 Like, that somebody woke up in the middle of the night this many times just to wipe my ass. It\u0027s just profound to me. So you start to have a great deal more respect for your own parents. Not that I didn\u0027t already. But I don\u0027t know how my parents did it with four kids. Four boys! Who basically did everything short of setting their own home on fire every single day of their lives. It\u0027s gotta be pretty intense.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhat have you learned about yourself from the experience so far?\u000A\u000A\u0022There are a million clichés that are just true. I get why parents have that sort of predisposition to talk about their child as if they\u0027re the only people that have ever copulated and pumped out a kid. I understand that. I don\u0027t fucking fall victim to it, because, especially celebrities, when they talk about their kid, they talk about their kid like they\u0027re the Chosen One, or they\u0027re the only people who have ever had a child.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Let me tell you about this thing called childbirth.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, man. Honestly, I\u0027ve really seen that line. I find it to be really obnoxious. In fact, every time I talk about my kid in public, I\u0027m generally talking about how average she is. But at home, I\u0027m like, ‘You\u0027re a genius! Oh, my God! You just took a shit in your diaper that came out as a perfect musical note!\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ADo you miss your old life? You can\u0027t just take a spontaneous trip anymore.\u000A\u000A\u0022I didn\u0027t miss it until you fucking said it like that, no.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThis spring, Lively posted an Instagram photo of Reynolds carrying James in a baby carrier, and apparently James\u0027s feet were together when they should\u0027ve been separated or something, who knows really, and the couple found themselves being harangued by millions of mommy bloggers. \u0022Please read your baby product manuals with as much detail as you read a script\u0022—someone really left that comment on Lively\u0027s Instagram. Matt Lauer even grilled Reynolds about the incident on The Today Show.\u000A\u000AAnd it\u0027s funny, because you can tell you\u0027re answering through gritted teeth.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, ‘Can I just make some mistakes and all of you just fuck off?\u0027 Yeah. You want to be able to say that. But you can\u0027t say that. There is almost no community on Earth as intense as the parent-child online community.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt was as if the existence of a child spawned by Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively drove people around them crazy, like actually crazy, and there was a two-week stretch near the beginning when Reynolds wondered if it was always going to be like this.\u000A\u000AFirst he got hit by a car. It was April, a few months after his kid was born, and he was in Vancouver, shooting Deadpool. \u0022I was in an underground parking garage that…The guy has yet to appear in court, so I don\u0027t even know if I can talk about it. But, yeah, I was hit by a car.\u0022 That was drama enough—a paparazzo striking Ryan Reynolds with his car. (He was fine.)\u000A\u000ABut that wasn\u0027t the worst part. \u0022A guy that I\u0027d known for my whole life, one of my closest friends growing up, he had been shopping pictures of my baby around. I kind of got in front of it, which is good. But it was a slightly dark period. A bad couple of weeks.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis was somebody you knew well?\u000A\u000A\u0022Somebody I grew up with, yeah. Somebody I\u0027ve known, who\u0027s been one of my closest friends, for 25 years.\u0022\u000A\u000AWas that an experience you\u0027d had before, being betrayed by someone like that?\u000A\u000A\u0022No. It was like a death. It was like one of those devastating things to find out.\u0022\u000A\u000ADid you have a conversation about it?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. Yeah. It was a pretty strongly worded conversation.\u0022\u000A\u000ADid he do it for money?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, just for money. I mean, I don\u0027t think he thought he would ever be caught. But it\u0027s a pretty narrow group of people that I would send photos like that to. They\u0027re just, like, my closest family and my closest friends: ‘Here\u0027s us in the delivery room!\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AWere you like, \u0022Next time you need a check, just ask\u0022?\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, I think he\u0027d asked for a check enough times where I was like, ‘There\u0027s no more checks to be had.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AProbably no more baby pictures, either.\u000A\u000A\u0022No. It was, like, so kind of shocking. There isn\u0027t really a conversation to have. It\u0027s just, ‘Oh, well, now I\u0027m never going to see you or talk to you again, unfortunately.\u0027 That\u0027s kind of how it worked out.\u0022\u000A\u000AReynolds figures the paparazzi guy hit him because he was trying to get a photo of his daughter before the one his buddy was shopping came out. \u0022The whole thing becomes so absurd that all you can do is laugh about it and just go, ‘This isn\u0027t the real world. This isn\u0027t how real things work.\u0027 But it happens to be happening right now. And it will pass. And it does. It passes. It all passed.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARyan Reynolds\u0027s most recent film, just coming out now, is called Mississippi Grind. Him and Ben Mendelsohn, playing two broken, compulsive gamblers on the road, California Split-style, finding refuge in each other. Reynolds\u0027s character is mouthy, a little bit caustic, but almost pathologically good-hearted and likeable—attributes he shares with the actor playing him. The role seems liberating for Reynolds; he doesn\u0027t have to show off his abs, or his jawline, or even topline the movie, and you can see the delight he takes in that freedom. He\u0027s charismatic in the film the way he was in Adventureland and Van Wilder and all the other cult hits that have maintained his reputation as an actor worth watching even when more high-profile stuff like R.I.P.D. failed him.\u000A\u000AMississippi Grind concludes a run of smaller, more auteur-oriented movies—Tarsem Singh\u0027s Self/less, Atom Egoyan\u0027s The Captive, Marjane Satrapi\u0027s The Voices, and Simon Curtis\u0027s Woman in Gold—for Reynolds, who says his flight from bigger studio films was mostly unintentional. But he is aware of the perception that blockbuster Hollywood, for lack of a better term, has sometimes been unkind to his career. There is a very pointed Green Lantern joke in the trailer for Deadpool, the six-years-in-the-making, passion project/comic-book film he will star in early next year. And there is an even more pointed Ryan Reynolds joke in another Deadpool teaser, which advertises its star as \u0022five-time Academy Award viewer Ryan Reynolds.\u0022 The line came from Reynolds himself.\u000A\u000AIs there a secret note of pain in that joke?\u000A\u000A\u0022A little bit, yeah. But that\u0027s what makes it funny, I think. I wish I was a five-time Academy Award winner. I don\u0027t wake up in the middle of the night at a perfect right angle thinking, why have I not been nominated for five Academy Awards? I can pretty much tell you why.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhy?\u000A\u000A\u0022That hasn\u0027t been the chief sort of goal for me at all. I mean, even if it was the chief goal for me, I don\u0027t know if I could ever be in that ring. I have no idea.\u0022\u000A\u000ADoing smaller, more semi-independent films: Has that been a deliberate choice?\u000A\u000A\u0022Not particularly. It\u0027s not not deliberate. But I find that, like, studio movies have always been much more deliberate choices. You just never know. I\u0027ve done big movies that just absolutely sucked, once they were finally cut together and put up on the big screen. And I\u0027ve done small movies where the same thing can happen. You just never know. I do have faith in directors. I believe that film is a director\u0027s medium.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s something you say a lot. The unspoken part being that you\u0027ve had to learn that lesson through some not-great experiences with directors, right?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yes! There have been some hard-earned experiences with respect to that. But I have to take whatever responsibility I have to take, too. I\u0027m not just saying, ‘Oh, it was them\u0027 or ‘They fucked this up.\u0027 I also chose it, you know. There\u0027s my face up there the whole time. I made those choices.\u0022\u000A\u000AOne of the things I liked about Mississippi Grind, for instance, is how well you cede the screen to Ben Mendelsohn. It\u0027s your face up there, but there\u0027s also his.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, yeah, but I\u0027ve done a lot of movies where the person I was co-starring with is a massive star, and [its underperformance is] still, for some reason, it\u0027s my fault.\u0022\u000A\u000ASuch as?\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t even want to say. Actors get an undeserved amount of credit when a movie works. The same is true when it doesn\u0027t work. So you kind of take the good with the bad.\u0022\u000A\u000AI just watched Self/less—\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m sorry.\u0022\u000A\u000A—which came out a month ago but is already out of theaters. This is a lousy question, but: The amount of time and effort and energy that you put into that film, to see it already gone, what is that experience like?\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s always weird. Like, you know, it sounds like a cliché, but the journey is the reward. You want movies to work, and sometimes they don\u0027t. Movies are an intersection of a number of different talents, and sometimes they work, and sometimes they don\u0027t, and it\u0027s just…are you asking, like, am I lying awake at night going, ‘Why didn\u0027t that work?\u0027 No. Not at all.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhy did you just say \u0022I\u0027m sorry\u0022?\u000A\u000A\u0022I was mostly just kidding. Because the movie didn\u0027t turn out as well as I think I wanted, or Tarsem wanted. But, you know, at the same time, I can\u0027t speak for them. Maybe it turned out exactly how they wanted it.\u0022\u000A\u000ALast year at Cannes, you were there with Atom Egoyan for The Captive, and he told The Hollywood Reporter, \u0022One of the things I\u0027m most proud of with this film is it will completely redefine Ryan\u0027s career.\u0022 [Reynolds laughs] What is your reaction when people say stuff like that?\u000A\u000A\u0022When you\u0027re saying something to a reporter in the press, the same way I am right now—like, I\u0027m talking to you, but I\u0027m also clocking what I\u0027m saying and how I\u0027m saying it, looking for the ‘Gotcha\u0027 moment, because there\u0027s this tendency to have this ‘Gotcha\u0027 journalism these days. And honestly, coming over here, I get fucking nervous, because I\u0027m just like, ‘What am I gonna say that I\u0027m gonna, in a month from now, go like, Wait, did I fucking say that?\u0027 So, yeah, I don\u0027t know what Atom\u0027s saying there. It\u0027s one interview of a fucking hundred he probably did that day, where he\u0027s saying something—yeah, you could look at that and go, like, ‘Well, what about my career needs to be redefined?\u0027 But for a lot of people, if you look at me, maybe my career needs to be redefined. Maybe, like, they think, ‘Oh, he\u0027s better than the movies that he does,\u0027 or, you know, ‘Maybe he\u0027s just perfect for the movies that he does,\u0027 or maybe not. I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s all just sort of like subjective nonsense. And I know Atom personally. I love Atom. And so when Atom says something like that, and—I can tell that you take it, like, well, ‘Isn\u0027t that offensive to you, or is that upsetting to you\u0027…?\u0022\u000A\u000AI did think it might be offensive to you.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, it doesn\u0027t bother me, because I know what it\u0027s like to do a hundred and fifty interviews in a day. And I know how difficult that is, and I know that you say stuff that—like, if I called him about that, he would, I\u0027m sure, say, ‘Oh, my God, I had no idea it came out that way.\u0027 I can think of probably a dozen times that I\u0027ve jammed both of my feet in my mouth in an interview where I just thought, ‘That was never my intention, to say something about somebody else like that.\u0027 Even now, talking about Tarsem, I\u0027m like, ‘Am I gonna read that and go, oh, that\u0027s offensive to Tarsem?\u0027 I mean, to be perfectly frank, I dread these things, because I really want to, like, relax and just, like, have a conversation, but at the same time, I am a veteran of this gig enough to know that I can\u0027t do that.\u0022\u000A\u000AStanley Tucci once suggested that your curse was that you\u0027re a character actor trapped in a leading man\u0027s body.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, that\u0027s an uptown problem, I would say. But no, I love it—because the character roles are the ones that get to be more outrageous. They\u0027re the ones that are imbued with a lot more character. They\u0027re the ones that get to take weird risks, because the whole film isn\u0027t hinged upon their ultimate redemption, like it is for the leading role. Because the audience doesn\u0027t have to like me.\u0022\u000A\u000AAre there times when you\u0027re happy to headline a movie?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. Deadpool, I loved doing that. That\u0027s sort of a dream come true for me. But again, he\u0027s funny and acerbic and a little bit of a head case. But he\u0027s also not trying to be liked. He\u0027s intentionally trying to annoy everyone.\u0022\u000A\u000AWas part of you reluctant to go back to superhero movies?\u000A\u000A\u0022A little bit. But Deadpool was different because there wasn\u0027t a big budget attached to it. There was not a tremendous responsibility to meet some kind of bottom line. Those kinds of superhero movies when you\u0027re out front, there\u0027s a vast and quite frightening budget attached to them. This one had a super-reasonable budget, and it was subversive and a little bit different, and to me a little refreshing in the comic-book world. But you always have trepidation. When you\u0027re out front, you have trepidation.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn the Deadpool trailer, he makes that very pointed joke about not wanting his suit to be green. It made me wonder: What if Green Lantern had actually been successful? Would that have been a good thing or a bad thing for you?\u000A\u000A\u0022I mean, I don\u0027t give a rusty fuck, because—I know that this is gonna sound like some sort of guy who\u0027s spent a little bit of time in a monastery or something, but it all led to here. If I had to do it all again, I\u0027d do the exact same thing. You know, also, Green Lantern—you gotta remember, at the time, everyone was gunning for that role. The guys I was screen-testing against are amazing talents. [Reynolds reportedly beat out Bradley Cooper, Justin Timberlake, and Jared Leto for the role.] But would I change it? No! And if it was as big a success, then it might have offered a whole different avenue of opportunities, or maybe I would just be kind of always that guy. I really don\u0027t know.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou\u0027d be on Green Lantern 3 right now.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, for sure. I think I would be probably in prep for Green Lantern 3 right now. That sounds about right.\u0022\u000A\u000AA couple of years ago you said, \u0022Every time I\u0027ve gotten myself into trouble, it\u0027s because I\u0027m choosing a project based on a long-term career goal as opposed to something that speaks to me at the moment.\u0022 What was the long-term career goal there?\u000A\u000A\u0022I think stability. You always want some semblance of stability. I think everyone does. Particularly if your endgame goal is to have a family and have some semblance of routine and normalcy. You know, it\u0027s stability, I think. And that can be dangerous. Because it\u0027s an illusion.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo you don\u0027t feel like you\u0027re chasing that stability anymore?\u000A\u000A\u0022No, no, no. I really don\u0027t have any immediate or long-term plans, actually, to be perfectly frank. I\u0027ve sort of, in a great way, kind of surrendered to the idea that it\u0027s just gonna be the way it\u0027s gonna be. And I\u0027m gonna work as hard as I\u0027ve always worked. Even on movies that didn\u0027t work, I\u0027ve worked really, really hard. And all the people around you are working really, really hard. But sometimes that creates dysfunction. So you have a hundred and fifty people that are working very hard at something in different directions, and it creates something that doesn\u0027t work.\u0022\u000A\u000AEspecially on the bigger things.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah! Absolutely. And then sometimes that friction can cause something amazing to happen. But that\u0027s more on smaller movies. Because in the bigger movies they\u0027re not willing to have any degree of risk. So there\u0027s no room for the character to be divisive in any way. They have to fulfill some kind of illusory ideal of the perfect man, you know, particularly in superhero films. And you look at them now, and I think why a lot of them are working is that Marvel in particular handles those properties really well. You know, they really know what they\u0027re doing, and they know how to appeal to a vast audience in a way that also has some real artistic merit, too. Then there\u0027s other people that are just totally fatigued by the superhero genre.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADeadpool will arrive at an interesting moment for Reynolds, who will once again headline a large-ish studio film, and for comic-book movies in general. The week we talk, Fantastic Four has just shattered into a thousand brittle pieces at the box office, cooling the ascent, at least temporarily, of a bright young cast that includes Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan—the end of a long summer of indifferent reactions for high-profile Marvel projects like Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man.\u000A\u000AYou were talking about audience fatigue. You look at this summer and you have Avengers: Age of Ultron and Joss Whedon coming out after directing that film and saying, in effect, \u0022I think I\u0027m dead.\u0022 [Whedon to the L.A. Times: \u0022It\u0027s weird because the first one was very, very, very hard. This one was much harder. It a little bit broke me.\u0022]\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. ‘I\u0027ve legally passed away.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AAnd then just last week, you had Fantastic Four really fail spectacularly. I\u0027d be curious what your take is: Do you think that\u0027s audience exhaustion, or do you think there\u0027s something about the machine that\u0027s breaking down right now?\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s a genre. There are good horror movies and bad horror movies. There are good comedies and bad comedies. Think of it like that. Think of it less about just superheroes. I do believe that they explore similar archetypes a lot, so I think that notion can be somewhat fatiguing, maybe. I think one of the reasons that Deadpool has gained a lot of momentum isn\u0027t just that it\u0027s funny or isn\u0027t just that it\u0027s rated R. The meta aspect is very important. So I think Deadpool\u0027s coming along at the right time, because it\u0027s also speaking to that generation and that group of people that have seen them all, seen all these comic-book films and enjoyed them all to varying degrees of success. But I think it\u0027s speaking to them as though the guy in that red suit is one of them, to some degree.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe guy who\u0027s watching the more conventional superheroes and sort of wisecracking along.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. It\u0027s like there\u0027s an element of, like, watching a DVD commentary by someone who\u0027s got some pop-culture savvy and is kind of funny and a little obnoxious and is saying the things that you maybe wouldn\u0027t say. It\u0027s fun. That\u0027s also why the film is budgeted the way it\u0027s budgeted, is released the way it\u0027s released, is allowed to be rated R, kind of all these things. Because for the studio, it\u0027s actually relatively low-risk.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat do you think when you see young, bright, up-and-coming actors in Hollywood steered relentlessly into these franchises?\u000A\u000A\u0022A lot of them are incredible artists, and they need to have a franchise in order to pursue a lot of the other interests that they may have. It works as a bit of a conduit to the material that they want to be pursuing when they\u0027re not shooting the big franchise.\u0022\u000A\u000AI wonder if their commitment to the big franchise films actually prevents them from working on the type of material they want to be working on, because of sequels, contractual obligations, that sort of thing.\u000A\u000A\u0022Maybe. But then again—interestingly, thank God, there\u0027s more and more opportunities for women now than there was. Obviously there\u0027s a pay gap and an age gap in Hollywood that\u0027s kind of insane and at some point needs to be remedied, inch by inch or mile by mile. But, you know, Jennifer Lawrence, she\u0027s a movie star. I personally would go see a movie based exclusively on the fact that she\u0027s in it.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut she\u0027s also in two franchises. And you look at a guy like Miles Teller, who had Whiplash and seems so talented, and now is in this Fantastic Four maelstrom. That\u0027s how we rewarded that guy. We rewarded Michael B. Jordan for being amazing in all his films with—\u000A\u000A\u0022But I\u0027m more frustrated about the Michael B. Jordan aspect than Miles Teller. You know, Miles Teller\u0027s gonna recover. Miles Teller\u0027s gonna go on to do amazing things, you know. It\u0027s important that Michael B. Jordan continues to go on and do amazing things.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd you feel like they\u0027ll make it harder for a black actor than for a white one?\u000A\u000A\u0022I know it\u0027s not easy for a black actor. It\u0027s not easy for a female actor. It\u0027s not easy for a lot of people that are... That entire cast is amazingly talented. And I wouldn\u0027t wish that on anybody. I mean, I know what that feels like. It doesn\u0027t feel good. And it also is difficult, because you don\u0027t feel like you can control that outcome. You know, as much as you want to. You can\u0027t really.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADeadpool is in many ways both the comic-book project and the Ryan Reynolds project people have been waiting for—irreverent, wisecracking, subversive, not too taken with itself. Reynolds was first attached to the film in 2005, he says; the script was begun in 2009; and the film\u0027s director, Tim Miller, joined in 2011. It\u0027s been a long time coming, in other words, even by Hollywood standards.\u000A\u000AIt must have felt really good on the first day of shooting.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah! Oh, I made sure we marked it, too. Like, we just started rolling, and I was like, ‘No, no, hold on.\u0027 We went in the other room and we huddled up: ‘We\u0027re making this movie! We\u0027ve been trying to get this movie made for six fucking years, and here we are. We\u0027re doing it right now. Just remember this second. Just take a moment to be thankful for that.\u0027 And then we all went out and just started shooting and dicking around and had some fun.\u0022\u000A\u000A[In the corner of the barn is a reddish, Mars-colored bust of Reynolds\u0027s face, wrinkled and covered in scars.]\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s a Deadpool bust, right?\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s my scarred face, yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000AIs it liberating to do a movie in which your face looks like that?\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, really liberating, yeah. Because the character is called the Merc with a Mouth, and you have to explain that somehow. He can\u0027t just be this guy who\u0027s walking around and looks like a normal guy who\u0027s just super-obnoxious. There has to be a reason for it. And the reason for it is because he looks like that.\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027m sure your face is in the beginning—\u000A\u000A\u0022You see a little bit of it, yeah, on his road to looking like a fried taint.\u0022\u000A\u000AHave you ever had that experience before, where you\u0027re the star of the movie but your face isn\u0027t really in the movie?\u000A\u000A\u0022Um…have I ever had that experience? I don\u0027t know. I have trouble keeping track of all of that. I have to confess, there\u0027s a ton of films I\u0027ve done that I\u0027ve never seen. I just saw Adventureland recently. I loved it. I thought it was a really good film.\u0022\u000A\u000ACould you still enjoy the movie, even though you were in it?\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, yes, because I\u0027m watching it objectively. I\u0027m not really seeing myself, or I\u0027m not really seeing, ‘Oh, there\u0027s that trick I\u0027ll do in that moment to convey this kind of emotion.\u0027 You can\u0027t remember any of that crap. So you just watch it. And that\u0027s nice.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AZach Baron is GQ\u0027s staff writer.",

He&#x2019;s been the next big thing more times than he can count. But right now his life can be summed up in far more elemental terms. There&#x2019;s the rustic house about an hour of north of New York City, where he and his wife, Blake Lively, have chosen to live and raise their daughter, James. And then there&#x2019;s the baby-monitor app on his iPhone, which buzzes every couple seconds as we sit upstairs in the renovated barn next to the main house. &#x201C;This is your future right here,&#x201D; he says, showing me the cascade of alerts on his phone. James is 8 months old and about a hundred feet away, with her mother.

So I had some good examples. But I don&#x2019;t think you really necessarily need examples. You just try to not be a complete pile of shit and just be there for them. You know, I like it: I mean that in the heaviest context. I genuinely like it. I like being a father. I like having a daughter. I would like to have more kids.

I feel like I could sometimes have a bit of a short fuse, but there&#x2019;s just been this weirdly endless supply of patience. I have no problem waking up five times in the middle of the night and changing diapers, and as exhausted as you get, I have this stupid grin on my face all the time. And that&#x2019;s not because I have a nanny or something like that.

Once you have a kid, you just think, like, &#x2018;I can&#x2019;t believe that another person did all this shit for me, that I&#x2019;m doing for this person right now!&#x2019; Like, that somebody woke up in the middle of the night this many times just to wipe my ass. It&#x2019;s just profound to me. So you start to have a great deal more respect for your own parents. Not that I didn&#x2019;t already. But I don&#x2019;t know how my parents did it with four kids. Four boys! Who basically did everything short of setting their own home on fire every single day of their lives.

I don&#x2019;t fucking fall victim to it, because, especially celebrities, when they talk about their kid, they talk about their kid like they&#x2019;re the Chosen One, or they&#x2019;re the only people who have ever had a child.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.e"><em>&#x201C;Let me tell you about this thing called childbirth.&#x201D;</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.f">&#x201C;Oh, man.

Him and Ben Mendelsohn, playing two broken, compulsive gamblers on the road, <em>California Split-</em>style, finding refuge in each other. Reynolds&#x2019;s character is mouthy, a little bit caustic, but almost pathologically good-hearted and likeable&#x2014;attributes he shares with the actor playing him. The role seems liberating for Reynolds; he doesn&#x2019;t have to show off his abs, or his jawline, or even topline the movie, and you can see the delight he takes in that freedom. He&#x2019;s charismatic in the film the way he was in <em>Adventureland</em> and <em>Van Wilder</em> and all the other cult hits that have maintained his reputation as an actor worth watching even when more high-profile stuff like <em>R.I.P.D.</em> failed him.</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.15"><em>Mississippi Grind</em> concludes a run of smaller, more auteur-oriented movies&#x2014;Tarsem Singh&#x2019;s <em>Self/less</em>, Atom Egoyan&#x2019;s <em>The Captive</em>, Marjane Satrapi&#x2019;s <em>The Voices</em>, and Simon Curtis&#x2019;s <em>Woman in Gold</em>&#x2014;for Reynolds, who says his flight from bigger studio films was mostly unintentional. But he is aware of the perception that blockbuster Hollywood, for lack of a better term, has sometimes been unkind to his career. There is a very pointed <em>Green Lantern</em> joke in the trailer for <em>Deadpool</em>, the six-years-in-the-making, passion project/comic-book film he will star in early next year. And there is an even more pointed Ryan Reynolds joke in another <em>Deadpool</em> teaser, which advertises its star as &#x201C;five-time Academy Award viewer Ryan Reynolds.&#x201D; The line came from Reynolds himself.</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.16"><em>Is there a secret note of pain in that joke</em>?</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.17">&#x201C;A little bit, yeah. But that&#x2019;s what makes it funny, I think. I wish I was a five-time Academy Award winner. I don&#x2019;t wake up in the middle of the night at a perfect right angle thinking, why have I not been nominated for five Academy Awards? I can pretty much tell you why.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.18"><em>Why?</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.19">&#x201C;That hasn&#x2019;t been the chief sort of goal for me at all. I mean, even if it was the chief goal for me, I don&#x2019;t know if I could ever be in that ring. I have no idea.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1a"><em>Doing smaller, more semi-independent films: Has that been a deliberate choice?</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1b">&#x201C;Not particularly. It&#x2019;s not <em>not</em> deliberate. But I find that, like, studio movies have always been much more deliberate choices. You just never know. I&#x2019;ve done big movies that just absolutely sucked, once they were finally cut together and put up on the big screen. And I&#x2019;ve done small movies where the same thing can happen. You just never know. I do have faith in directors. I believe that film is a director&#x2019;s medium.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><em>That&#x2019;s something you say a lot.

There have been some hard-earned experiences with respect to that. But I have to take whatever responsibility I have to take, too. I&#x2019;m not just saying, &#x2018;Oh, it was them&#x2019; or &#x2018;They fucked this up.&#x2019; I also chose it, you know. There&#x2019;s my face up there the whole time. I made those choices.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><em>One of the things I liked about</em> Mississippi Grind<em>, for instance, is how well you cede the screen to Ben Mendelsohn.

Like, you know, it sounds like a clich&#xE9;, but the journey is the reward. You want movies to work, and sometimes they don&#x2019;t. Movies are an intersection of a number of different talents, and sometimes they work, and sometimes they don&#x2019;t, and it&#x2019;s just&#x2026;are you asking, like, am I lying awake at night going, &#x2018;Why didn&#x2019;t that work?&#x2019; No. Not at all.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1m"><em>Why did you just say &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry&#x201D;?</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1n">&#x201C;I was mostly just kidding. Because the movie didn&#x2019;t turn out as well as I think I wanted, or Tarsem wanted. But, you know, at the same time, I can&#x2019;t speak for them. Maybe it turned out exactly how they wanted it.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1o"><em>Last year at Cannes, you were there with Atom Egoyan for</em> The Captive<em>, and he told</em> The Hollywood Reporter<em>, &#x201C;One of the things I&#x2019;m most proud of with this film is it will completely redefine Ryan&#x2019;s career.&#x201D;</em> [Reynolds laughs] <em>What is your reaction when people say stuff like that?</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1p">&#x201C;When you&#x2019;re saying something to a reporter in the press, the same way I am right now&#x2014;like, I&#x2019;m talking to you, but I&#x2019;m also clocking what I&#x2019;m saying and how I&#x2019;m saying it, looking for the &#x2018;Gotcha&#x2019; moment, because there&#x2019;s this tendency to have this &#x2018;Gotcha&#x2019; journalism these days. And honestly, coming over here, I get fucking nervous, because I&#x2019;m just like, &#x2018;What am I gonna say that I&#x2019;m gonna, in a month from now, go like, Wait, did I fucking say that?&#x2019; So, yeah, I don&#x2019;t know what Atom&#x2019;s saying there. It&#x2019;s one interview of a fucking hundred he probably did that day, where he&#x2019;s saying something&#x2014;yeah, you could look at that and go, like, &#x2018;Well, what about my career needs to be redefined?&#x2019; But for a lot of people, if you look at me, maybe my career needs to be redefined. Maybe, like, they think, &#x2018;Oh, he&#x2019;s better than the movies that he does,&#x2019; or, you know, &#x2018;Maybe he&#x2019;s just perfect for the movies that he does,&#x2019; or maybe not. I don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s all just sort of like subjective nonsense. And I know Atom personally. I love Atom. And so when Atom says something like that, and&#x2014;I can tell that you take it, like, well, &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t that offensive to you, or is that upsetting to you&#x2019;&#x2026;?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1q"><em>I did think it might be offensive to you.</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1r">&#x201C;Yeah, it doesn&#x2019;t bother me, because I know what it&#x2019;s like to do a hundred and fifty interviews in a day. And I know how difficult that is, and I know that you say stuff that&#x2014;like, if I called him about that, he would, I&#x2019;m sure, say, &#x2018;Oh, my God, I had no idea it came out that way.&#x2019; I can think of probably a dozen times that I&#x2019;ve jammed both of my feet in my mouth in an interview where I just thought, &#x2018;That was never my intention, to say something about somebody else like that.&#x2019; Even now, talking about Tarsem, I&#x2019;m like, &#x2018;Am I gonna read that and go, oh, that&#x2019;s offensive to Tarsem?&#x2019; I mean, to be perfectly frank, I dread these things, because I really want to, like, relax and just, like, have a conversation, but at the same time, I am a veteran of this gig enough to know that I can&#x2019;t do that.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1s"><em>Stanley Tucci once suggested that your curse was that you&#x2019;re a character actor trapped in a leading man&#x2019;s body.</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1t">&#x201C;Yeah, that&#x2019;s an uptown problem, I would say. But no, I love it&#x2014;because the character roles are the ones that get to be more outrageous. They&#x2019;re the ones that are imbued with a lot more character. They&#x2019;re the ones that get to take weird risks, because the whole film isn&#x2019;t hinged upon their ultimate redemption, like it is for the leading role.

That&#x2019;s sort of a dream come true for me. But again, he&#x2019;s funny and acerbic and a little bit of a head case. But he&#x2019;s also not trying to be liked.

But <em>Deadpool</em> was different because there wasn&#x2019;t a big budget attached to it. There was not a tremendous responsibility to meet some kind of bottom line. Those kinds of superhero movies when you&#x2019;re out front, there&#x2019;s a vast and quite frightening budget attached to them. This one had a super-reasonable budget, and it was subversive and a little bit different, and to me a little refreshing in the comic-book world. But you always have trepidation. When you&#x2019;re out front, you have trepidation.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.1y"><em>In the</em> Deadpool <em>trailer, he makes that very pointed joke about not wanting his suit to be green.</em> <em>It made me wonder: What if</em> Green Lantern <em>had</em> <em>actually</em> <em>been successful?

If I had to do it all again, I&#x2019;d do the exact same thing. You know, also, <em>Green Lantern</em>&#x2014;you gotta remember, at the time, everyone was gunning for that role. The guys I was screen-testing against are amazing talents. [<em>Reynolds reportedly beat out Bradley Cooper, Justin Timberlake, and Jared Leto for the role.</em>] But would I change it? No! And if it was as big a success, then it might have offered a whole different avenue of opportunities, or maybe I would just be kind of always that guy.

You always want some semblance of stability. I think everyone does. Particularly if your endgame goal is to have a family and have some semblance of routine and normalcy. You know, it&#x2019;s stability, I think. And that can be dangerous. Because it&#x2019;s an illusion.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.24"><em>So you don&#x2019;t feel like you&#x2019;re chasing that</em> <em>stability</em> <em>anymore?</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.25">&#x201C;No, no, no. I really don&#x2019;t have any immediate or long-term plans, actually, to be perfectly frank. I&#x2019;ve sort of, in a great way, kind of surrendered to the idea that it&#x2019;s just gonna be the way it&#x2019;s gonna be. And I&#x2019;m gonna work as hard as I&#x2019;ve always worked. Even on movies that didn&#x2019;t work, I&#x2019;ve worked really, really hard. And all the people around you are working really, really hard. But sometimes that creates dysfunction. So you have a hundred and fifty people that are working very hard at something in different directions, and it creates something that doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.26"><em>Especially on the bigger things.</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.27">&#x201C;Yeah! Absolutely. And then sometimes that friction can cause something amazing to happen. But that&#x2019;s more on smaller movies. Because in the bigger movies they&#x2019;re not willing to have any degree of risk. So there&#x2019;s no room for the character to be divisive in any way. They have to fulfill some kind of illusory ideal of the perfect man, you know, particularly in superhero films. And you look at them now, and I think why a lot of them are working is that Marvel in particular handles those properties really well. You know, they really know what they&#x2019;re doing, and they know how to appeal to a vast audience in a way that also has some real artistic merit, too. Then there&#x2019;s other people that are just totally fatigued by the superhero genre.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.28"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.29"><em>Deadpool</em> will arrive at an interesting moment for Reynolds, who will once again headline a large-ish studio film, and for comic-book movies in general. The week we talk, <em>Fantastic Four</em> has just shattered into a thousand brittle pieces at the box office, cooling the ascent, at least temporarily, of a bright young cast that includes Miles Teller and Michael B. Jordan&#x2014;the end of a long summer of indifferent reactions for high-profile Marvel projects like <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> and <em>Ant-Man</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.2a"><em>You were talking about audience fatigue.

I&#x2019;d be curious what your take is: Do you think that&#x2019;s audience exhaustion, or do you think there&#x2019;s something about the machine that&#x2019;s breaking down right now?</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.2d">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s a genre. There are good horror movies and bad horror movies. There are good comedies and bad comedies. Think of it like that. Think of it less about just superheroes. I do believe that they explore similar archetypes a lot, so I think that notion can be somewhat fatiguing, maybe. I think one of the reasons that <em>Deadpool</em> has gained a lot of momentum isn&#x2019;t just that it&#x2019;s funny or isn&#x2019;t just that it&#x2019;s rated R. The meta aspect is very important. So I think <em>Deadpool</em>&#x2019;s coming along at the right time, because it&#x2019;s also speaking to that generation and that group of people that have seen them all, seen all these comic-book films and enjoyed them all to varying degrees of success. But I think it&#x2019;s speaking to them as though the guy in that red suit is one of them, to some degree.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.2e"><em>The guy who&#x2019;s watching the more conventional superheroes and sort of wisecracking along.</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.2f">&#x201C;Yeah. It&#x2019;s like there&#x2019;s an element of, like, watching a DVD commentary by someone who&#x2019;s got some pop-culture savvy and is kind of funny and a little obnoxious and is saying the things that you maybe wouldn&#x2019;t say. It&#x2019;s fun. That&#x2019;s also why the film is budgeted the way it&#x2019;s budgeted, is released the way it&#x2019;s released, is allowed to be rated R, kind of all these things. Because for the studio, it&#x2019;s actually relatively low-risk.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.2g"><em>What do you think when you see young, bright, up-and-coming actors in Hollywood steered relentlessly into these franchises?</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.2h">&#x201C;A lot of them are incredible artists, and they need to have a franchise in order to pursue a lot of the other interests that they may have. It works as a bit of a conduit to the material that they want to be pursuing when they&#x2019;re not shooting the big franchise.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.2i"><em>I wonder if their commitment to the big franchise films actually </em>prevents<em> them from working on the type of material they want to be working on, because of sequels, contractual obligations, that sort of thing.</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.2j">&#x201C;Maybe. But then again&#x2014;interestingly, thank God, there&#x2019;s more and more opportunities for women now than there was. Obviously there&#x2019;s a pay gap and an age gap in Hollywood that&#x2019;s kind of insane and at some point needs to be remedied, inch by inch or mile by mile. But, you know, Jennifer Lawrence, she&#x2019;s a movie star. I personally would go see a movie based exclusively on the fact that she&#x2019;s in it.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.2k"><em>But she&#x2019;s also in two franchises. And you look at a guy like Miles Teller, who had </em>Whiplash<em> and seems so talented, and now is in this </em>Fantastic Four<em> maelstrom. That&#x2019;s how we rewarded that guy. We rewarded Michael B. Jordan for being amazing in all his films with&#x2014;</em></p><p data-reactid=".isukaayhog.1.1.0.0.4.2l">&#x201C;But I&#x2019;m more frustrated about the Michael B. Jordan aspect than Miles Teller. You know, Miles Teller&#x2019;s gonna recover. Miles Teller&#x2019;s gonna go on to do amazing things, you know. It&#x2019;s important that Michael B.

It&#x2019;s not easy for a female actor. It&#x2019;s not easy for a lot of people that are... That entire cast is amazingly talented. And I wouldn&#x2019;t wish that on anybody. I mean, I know what that feels like. It doesn&#x2019;t feel good. And it also is difficult, because you don&#x2019;t feel like you can control that outcome. You know, as much as you want to.
