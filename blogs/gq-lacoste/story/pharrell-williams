  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A  Pari Dukovic Portfolio: 19 Musicians in 76 Days  See All of The Legacy Project\u000A\u000A10:57 a.m. Uniqlo, West Hollywood\u000A\u000A When Pharrell arrives, it\u0027s as if in a bubble. Like Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. Starbucks in one hand, two Asian-American women assistants trailing in his wake, a Chanel scarf waving from his back pocket. Uniqlo has closed this store, in the Beverly Center, for an event: About thirty homeless kids have been given a shopping spree. Pharrell Williams, who of course collaborates on a clothing line with Uniqlo, is the surprise guest.\u000A\u000AHe takes a picture with a girl in a her royal smurfness T-shirt and checks out jeans with a kid in a Lakers jersey. Truth be told, a lot of these kids don\u0027t seem to know who he is. Most 7-year-olds don\u0027t even know what a celebrity is. They don\u0027t know that this is the man who, not long ago, was responsible for 43 percent of songs played on the radio in a single month; they probably don\u0027t watch The Voice, where Pharrell is a celebrity \u0022coach\u0022; they don\u0027t listen to \u0022Blurred Lines\u0022 and know, hey, the genius behind that song wasn\u0027t Robin Thicke, it was longtime super-producer and current pop star Pharrell Williams; and they don\u0027t know that his 2014 album, G I R L, is up for an album-of-the-year Grammy. Free skinny jeans in rainbow colors stacked to the raftersthat\u0027s more intoxicating to a homeless kid than the reigning pop-music genius of our time.\u000A\u000ANone of this bothers Pharrell. He is in his bubble, wandering the consumer video game that is Uniqlo. You could find a worse metaphor for Pharrell than Uniqlo. Post-racial, post-gender, kind of post-national. Its products are bright and happy and totally synthetic and futuristic and irresistible and are born of that high-low mix.\u000A\u000AI\u0027m not saying we won\u0027t discover more about him in the next thirteen hours. But I will come to believe that everything there is to know about Pharrell can be gathered by watching him glide around looking silently at $15 tights. He is aloof, beneficent, curious, otherworldly. It\u0027s like he\u0027s only assumed a human form to make us less frightened. He\u0027s regal. His clothes seem like a royal outfit of his own designshredded jeans, a leopard-print shirt, a baseball jacket made of the thinnest diaphanous chiffon with printed flowers, which is part of his collection for Adidas. And the hat. Flat-brimmed and tall and stiffly perched on his head. Does he realize it\u0027s kind of crown-like? The accessories are exhausting to catalog. The necklaces, the rings, the stacks of sparkly bracelets, the earrings, all of them tasteful but, in accumulation, acquiring a vibe of decoration. He\u0027s a decorated king.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s a quiet little Egyptian space cat of a dude.\u000A\u000A11:48 a.m. Heading north on Cahuenga Boulevard\u000A\u000AWhen he rides in his Cadillac Escalade, Pharrell rides in the front seat. Next to him is Ben, his security man for the past fifteen years.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yo, you remember that guy?\u0022 Pharrell is saying to Ben. \u0022Tall nigga, go by [I\u0027m leaving his name out]?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Nah,\u0022 Ben says. \u0022? I don\u0027t remember any .\u0022\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s no chauffeury tone to their conversation. They seem like two dudes who\u0027ve known each other a long time. Ben drives north toward the Universal lot, where Pharrell will shoot the third-to-last episode of season seven of The Voice.\u000A\u000APharrell slips an earpiece into his ear and answers a call. \u0022Good morning, young man.... I\u0027m all right.... Talk to me.\u0022 I later make an educated guess that it\u0027s his music manager.\u000A\u000A\u0022I wasn\u0027t happy about the T.I. situation,\u0022 Pharrell is saying, presumably talking about the T.I. record Paperwork, which he produced. \u0022They did that record hoping for radio play, and they got nothing out of it.... Great, you got your No. 1 hip-hop song. But what does that do for your sales?\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWhen he\u0027s talking to a journalist, Pharrell shoots rainbows and tarot cards from his eyes. This is something he said to me: \u0022It\u0027s all math. You have a certain number of bones in your body. You have seven holes in your face. There are nine planets, a sun, trillions and trillions of galaxies. Everything quantifies to numbers.\u0022 Or: \u0022The more suspended experiences you have, the more you\u0027re not bound by physical time.\u0022 I don\u0027t doubt that this stuff means a ton to Pharrell, and a lot of what he says reflects deep thought and hard-won wisdom. But if you want to understand the brilliant way his mind works vis--vis the recording industry, you shouldn\u0027t interview him; you should sit in the back of an Escalade and transcribe a conversation he\u0027s having while he\u0027s not paying attention to you.\u000A\u000A\u0022You want to be camouflage?\u0022 he says about the T.I. record. \u0022Go ahead. Blend in. But we want to be that twinkle in the sky.\u0022 It\u0027s a metaphor he likes, and it could serve as a philosophy: Being mass and being special are not mutually exclusive. \u0022We want to be that twinkle in the sky. And you might not be able to see that star now. But it\u0027s daytime. Wait till it gets dark.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn time they move on to another artist. \u0022With Kelly,\u0022 he says, speaking possibly about Kelly Clarkson, \u0022I think we break her out by going to the sync department at Sony. Go put her music on Sons of Anarchy, go put her music on House of Cards. Her songs are so sync-friendly, it\u0027s not even funny. This album is flawless. Let\u0027s get it.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe last order of business is about what seems to be an artist in trouble, someone even whose gender I will withhold.\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t know that I can do anything, bro,\u0022 he says. \u0022It doesn\u0027t look good. I don\u0027t know what I can do. It\u0027s in another place. It\u0027s not even me. There are some serious, serious issues. Music is therapy, but there are deeper issues. I\u0027m really worried. Really worried, man.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well,\u0022 he says, turning back to look at me, \u0022I have a writer in the car. That\u0027s why I\u0027m kind of talking around it.\u0022\u000A\u000A12:53 p.m. The talent compound at The Voice, Universal City\u000A\u000AIn about ten minutes, Pharrell will leave his trailer for the soundstage where he and Blake Shelton and Adam Levine and Christina Aguilera will pre-tape a \u0022Coaches\u0027 Performance\u0022 for next season. Season eight. Officials at The Voice will go ripshit if I divulge the name of the song. Let\u0027s just say you should get your mid-\u002790s leather pants ready to rock. But for these stolen moments in his trailer, Pharrell is making music. He\u0027s got his headphones on, so all I hear is a violent mashing of plastic against plastic as he communes with his keyboard. As he gets up and leaves his headphones behind, basically still smoking, he says to his assistant, Cactus, a woman with purple hair: \u0022Send [Big] Sean an e-mail and tell him he\u0027s got a missile coming.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut he likes it so much, he can\u0027t help but call Sean himself: \u0022It\u0027s not what we talked about, man. But it\u0027s haaaaard. It\u0027s like ghost-of-Shaka-Zulu hard!\u0022\u000A\u000A1:15 p.m. Some soundstage next to the soundstage where The Voice is filmed\u000A\u000AIn the minutes before their performance, the celebrity coaches of The Voice are sitting for an interview with E! News. The thing about The Voice is that it\u0027s not simply a show. It is, like many entertainment products, a lifestyle marketed to infiltrate your life at every moment. NBC does what it can to make sure it\u0027s in OK! magazine and on drive-time radio shows and covered by NBC affiliates as news. And when you\u0027re a \u0022coach,\u0022 being part of this lifestyle is your job. Right now, the hostess from E! wants them to describe the season in three words. \u0022Bituminous, outrageous, lavender\u0022 is what Adam Levine says, because his job is to drive the show by force of his self-aware need for everyone to like him. \u0022Inspiring, peppermint, cloud. I feel like I\u0027m high on cloud nine,\u0022 Gwen Stefani says, because how to respond to a bullshitty question but with a bullshitty answer? \u0022Firm yet soft,\u0022 Blake Shelton says, because ha-ha. Pharrell says, \u0022Uplifting, holistic, a gift,\u0022 because his identity is The Artist, which he is. Still. I wonder if the tremendous reserves of time and fakeness all this stuff requires doesn\u0027t completely drain him. I ask him: Why do The Voice? \u0022The ability,\u0022 he says, \u0022to reach so many people at the same time.\u0022\u000A\u000ABeing cool isn\u0027t cool. You know what\u0027s cool? Talking to 10 million people at once.\u000A\u000A3:32 p.m. The Voice soundstage, Universal City\u000A\u000AThe audience warmer-upper warms up the audience, and the four coaches sing five rousing renditions of [SONG NAME REDACTED FOR SPOILER REASONS] in a row. Then the live broadcast of December 9\u0027s The Voice gets started.\u000A\u000A8:37 p.m. Rooftop of the W hotel, Hollywood\u000A\u000ATonight, Pharrell will record a performance with Gwen Stefani of her song \u0022Spark the Fire,\u0022 which he produced. It will be broadcast, as if it\u0027s happening live, on Carson Daly\u0027s New Year\u0027s Eve special. Before he goes on, Team Pharrell retreats to a dressing room. His assistant, Cactus, is there, along with his art director, Phi, and Fatima, the beautiful choreographer. I ask Pharrell: Why do you surround yourself with women? Not to engage in racial/genre profiling or anything, but the world of hip-hop is dominated by artists surrounded by great clouds of pot smoke and testosterone.\u000A\u000A\u0022Women have a way of expressing themselves that I can relate to more honestly,\u0022 he says. \u0022I am a sensitive person, so I want to be with sensitive people.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe looks meaningfully around the room. \u0022They\u0027re pretty magical, the women that are here. They sense things before it happens.\u0022\u000A\u000A12:30 a.m. Glenwood Place Studios, Burbank\u000A\u000AThe night ends at a recording studio built into a little house. Lots of succulents and aloe plants, a little fountain, the sense that someone might offer you a fresh young coconut smoothie or a bong rip at any moment. The women of Pharrell are crashed on sofas in another room. Pharrell himself is seated at a studio console, eating chicken soup and working on a song he\u0027s writing for Snoop and Gwen Stefani. The song sounds pretty dope. I\u0027m not going to try to describe it, but in honor of Pharrell\u0027s synesthesia, I\u0027ll say: It sounds bright green.\u000A\u000APharrell, besides being a pop star in his own right, is kind of a musical McKinsey consultant for other artists. You come to him when you need a hit, and he\u0027ll guide you toward it, toward your \u0022twinkling star.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022It begins like an interview,\u0022 he says. \u0022And then the interview just turns into music. And sometimes it\u0027s not even talking; it\u0027s just the vibe. The vibe paints the room.\u0022\u000A\u000AOkay, I say, what vibe am I painting the room with? Without really looking up, he delivers a devastatingly precise evaluation of the contents of my soul: You wear plain clothes but have a very complicated interior; you don\u0027t like to glamorize yourself; you\u0027re intense and highly observant and hard on yourself and probably others. I feel instantly like he gets me. That\u0027s what you sign up for with Pharrell, besides hit songs: He understands you; you feel okay being vulnerable with him.\u000A\u000ADon\u0027t you ever get sick of producing content? I ask. It\u0027s a fucking long day. Singing songs for warmed-up studio audiences over and over. Writing songs. Planning to write songs. Don\u0027t you think the world is increasingly insatiable and impatient? Don\u0027t you ever get sick of being a slave to that?\u000A\u000A\u0022I am only a slave to my curiosity,\u0022 he says. Pharrell is the musician for his time. Not just because everyone wants to record songs with him, but because the amount of content required to keep people\u0027s attention, to feel relevant, is increasing mercilessly. The condition suits Pharrell. He can write fast; he wrote \u0022Blurred Lines\u0022 in half an hour. And he never seems to want to stop. He\u0027s like some Greek-myth-type figure, suspended in an act of constant creation, his brain just plugged into the Matrix and a beautiful, terrifying, constant stream of content pouring out.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s got the song going now. It\u0027s not finished, but it\u0027s alive, set in motion, waddling out there into the world on its own two feet, Pharrell following behind adding riffs and effects, clapping and singing Ooh, ooh, ooh and listening to it curiously, as if only now himself discovering its nature.\u000A\u000ADEVIN FRIEDMAN is GQ\u0027s director of editorial projects.",

All of The Legacy Project</strong></a></p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>10:57 a.m. Uniqlo, West Hollywood</strong></p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.3"> <strong>When Pharrell </strong>arrives, it&#x2019;s as if in a bubble. Like Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. Starbucks in one hand, two Asian-American women assistants trailing in his wake, a Chanel scarf waving from his back pocket. Uniqlo has closed this store, in the Beverly Center, for an event: About thirty homeless kids have been given a shopping spree. Pharrell Williams, who of course collaborates on a clothing line with Uniqlo, is the surprise guest.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.5">He takes a picture with a girl in a her royal smurfness T-shirt and checks out jeans with a kid in a Lakers jersey. Truth be told, a lot of these kids don&#x2019;t seem to know who he is. Most 7-year-olds don&#x2019;t even know what a <em>celebrity</em> is. They don&#x2019;t know that this is the man who, not long ago, was responsible for 43 percent of songs played on the radio in a single month; they probably don&#x2019;t watch <em>The Voice,</em> where Pharrell is a celebrity &quot;coach&quot;; they don&#x2019;t listen to &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; and know, hey, the genius behind that song wasn&#x2019;t Robin Thicke, it was longtime super-producer and current pop star Pharrell Williams; and they don&#x2019;t know that his 2014 album, <em>G I R L,</em> is up for an album-of-the-year Grammy. Free skinny jeans in rainbow colors stacked to the raftersthat&#x2019;s more intoxicating to a homeless kid than the reigning pop-music genius of our time.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.6">None of this bothers Pharrell. He is in his bubble, wandering the consumer video game that is Uniqlo. You could find a worse metaphor for Pharrell than Uniqlo. Post-racial, post-gender, kind of post-national. Its products are bright and happy and totally synthetic and futuristic and irresistible and are born of that high-low mix.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.7">I&#x2019;m not saying we won&#x2019;t discover more about him in the next thirteen hours. But I will come to believe that everything there is to know about Pharrell can be gathered by watching him glide around looking silently at $15 tights. He is aloof, beneficent, curious, otherworldly. It&#x2019;s like he&#x2019;s only assumed a human form to make us less frightened. He&#x2019;s regal. His clothes seem like a royal outfit of his own designshredded jeans, a leopard-print shirt, a baseball jacket made of the thinnest diaphanous chiffon with printed flowers, which is part of his collection for Adidas. And the hat. Flat-brimmed and tall and stiffly perched on his head. Does he realize it&#x2019;s kind of crown-like? The accessories are exhausting to catalog. The necklaces, the rings, the stacks of sparkly bracelets, the earrings, all of them tasteful but, in accumulation, acquiring a vibe of decoration. He&#x2019;s a decorated king.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.8">He&#x2019;s a quiet little Egyptian space cat of a dude.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>11:48 a.m.</strong> <strong>Heading north on Cahuenga Boulevard</strong></p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.a">When he rides in his Cadillac Escalade, Pharrell rides in the front seat. Next to him is Ben, his security man for the past fifteen years.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.b">&quot;Yo, you remember that guy?&quot; Pharrell is saying to Ben. &quot;Tall nigga, go by <em>[I&#x2019;m leaving his name out]</em>?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.c">&quot;Nah,&quot; Ben says. &quot;? I don&#x2019;t remember any .&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.d">There&#x2019;s no chauffeury tone to their conversation. They seem like two dudes who&#x2019;ve known each other a long time. Ben drives north toward the Universal lot, where Pharrell will shoot the third-to-last episode of season seven of <em>The Voice.</em></p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.e">Pharrell slips an earpiece into his ear and answers a call. &quot;Good morning, young man.... I&#x2019;m all right.... Talk to me.&quot; I later make an educated guess that it&#x2019;s his music manager.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.f">&quot;I wasn&#x2019;t happy about the T.I. situation,&quot; Pharrell is saying, presumably talking about the T.I. record <em>Paperwork,</em> which he produced. &quot;They did that record hoping for radio play, and they got nothing out of it.... Great, you got your No. 1 hip-hop song. But what does that do for your sales?&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.g"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5592fef16e48e6391a256d08/master/w_806/music-2015-02-pharrell-pharrell-gq-magazine-february-2015-01.jpg" alt="music-2015-02-pharrell-pharrell-gq-magazine-february-2015-01.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpharrell-williams&amp;t=music-2015-02-pharrell-pharrell-gq-magazine-february-2015-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpharrell-williams&amp;t=music-2015-02-pharrell-pharrell-gq-magazine-february-2015-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpharrell-williams&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5592fef16e48e6391a256d08%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmusic-2015-02-pharrell-pharrell-gq-magazine-february-2015-01.jpg&amp;description=music-2015-02-pharrell-pharrell-gq-magazine-february-2015-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpharrell-williams&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5592fef16e48e6391a256d08%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmusic-2015-02-pharrell-pharrell-gq-magazine-february-2015-01.jpg&amp;description=music-2015-02-pharrell-pharrell-gq-magazine-february-2015-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.h">When he&#x2019;s talking to a journalist, Pharrell shoots rainbows and tarot cards from his eyes. This is something he said to me: &quot;It&#x2019;s all math. You have a certain number of bones in your body. You have seven holes in your face. There are nine planets, a sun, trillions and trillions of galaxies. Everything quantifies to numbers.&quot; Or: &quot;The more suspended experiences you have, the more you&#x2019;re not bound by physical time.&quot; I don&#x2019;t doubt that this stuff means a ton to Pharrell, and a lot of what he says reflects deep thought and hard-won wisdom. But if you want to understand the brilliant way his mind works vis--vis the recording industry, you shouldn&#x2019;t interview him; you should sit in the back of an Escalade and transcribe a conversation he&#x2019;s having while he&#x2019;s not paying attention to you.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;You want to be camouflage?&quot; he says about the T.I. record. &quot;Go ahead. Blend in. But we want to be that twinkle in the sky.&quot; It&#x2019;s a metaphor he likes, and it could serve as a philosophy: Being mass and being special are not mutually exclusive. &quot;We want to be that twinkle in the sky. And you might not be able to see that star now. But it&#x2019;s daytime. <em>Wait till it gets dark</em>.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.j">In time they move on to another artist. &quot;With Kelly,&quot; he says, speaking possibly about Kelly Clarkson, &quot;I think we break her out by going to the sync department at Sony. Go put her music on <em>Sons of Anarchy,</em> go put her music on <em>House of Cards.</em> Her songs are so sync-friendly, it&#x2019;s not even funny. This album is <em>flawless</em>. Let&#x2019;s get it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.k">The last order of business is about what seems to be an artist in trouble, someone even whose gender I will withhold.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.l">&quot;I don&#x2019;t know that I can do anything, bro,&quot; he says. &quot;It doesn&#x2019;t look good. I don&#x2019;t know what I can do. It&#x2019;s in another place. It&#x2019;s not even me. There are some serious, serious issues. Music is therapy, but there are deeper issues. I&#x2019;m really worried. Really worried, man.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.m">&quot;Well,&quot; he says, turning back to look at me, &quot;I have a writer in the car. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m kind of talking <em>around</em> it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>12:53 p.m.</strong> <strong>The talent compound at <em>The Voice,</em> Universal City</strong></p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.o">In about ten minutes, Pharrell will leave his trailer for the soundstage where he and Blake Shelton and Adam Levine and Christina Aguilera will pre-tape a &quot;Coaches&#x2019; Performance&quot; for next season. Season eight. Officials at <em>The Voice</em> will go ripshit if I divulge the name of the song. Let&#x2019;s just say you should get your mid-&#x2019;90s leather pants ready to rock. But for these stolen moments in his trailer, Pharrell is making music. He&#x2019;s got his headphones on, so all I hear is a violent mashing of plastic against plastic as he communes with his keyboard. As he gets up and leaves his headphones behind, basically still smoking, he says to his assistant, Cactus, a woman with purple hair: &quot;Send [Big] Sean an e-mail and tell him he&#x2019;s got a missile coming.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.p">But he likes it so much, he can&#x2019;t help but call Sean himself: &quot;It&#x2019;s not what we talked about, man. But it&#x2019;s <em>haaaaard.</em> It&#x2019;s like ghost-of-Shaka-Zulu hard!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>1:15 p.m.</strong> <strong>Some soundstage next to the soundstage where <em>The Voice</em> is filmed</strong></p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.r">In the minutes before their performance, the celebrity coaches of <em>The Voice</em> are sitting for an interview with <em>E! News.</em> The thing about <em>The Voice</em> is that it&#x2019;s not simply a show. It is, like many entertainment products, a lifestyle marketed to infiltrate your life at every moment. NBC does what it can to make sure it&#x2019;s in <em>OK!</em> magazine and on drive-time radio shows and covered by NBC affiliates as news. And when you&#x2019;re a &quot;coach,&quot; being part of this lifestyle is your job. Right now, the hostess from <em>E!</em> wants them to describe the season in three words. &quot;Bituminous, outrageous, lavender&quot; is what Adam Levine says, because his job is to drive the show by force of his self-aware need for everyone to like him. &quot;Inspiring, peppermint, cloud. I feel like I&#x2019;m high on cloud nine,&quot; Gwen Stefani says, because how to respond to a bullshitty question but with a bullshitty answer? &quot;Firm yet soft,&quot; Blake Shelton says, because ha-ha. Pharrell says, &quot;Uplifting, holistic, a gift,&quot; because his identity is The Artist, which he is. Still. I wonder if the tremendous reserves of time and fakeness all this stuff requires doesn&#x2019;t completely drain him. I ask him: Why do <em>The Voice</em>? &quot;The ability,&quot; he says, &quot;to reach so many people at the same time.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.s">Being cool isn&#x2019;t cool. You know what&#x2019;s cool? Talking to 10 million people at once.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>3:32 p.m.</strong> <strong>The <em>Voice</em> soundstage, Universal City</strong></p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.u">The audience warmer-upper warms up the audience, and the four coaches sing five rousing renditions of [SONG NAME REDACTED FOR SPOILER REASONS] in a row. Then the live broadcast of December 9&#x2019;s <em>The Voice</em> gets started.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>8:37 p.m.</strong><strong> Rooftop of the W hotel, Hollywood</strong></p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.w">Tonight, Pharrell will record a performance with Gwen Stefani of her song &quot;Spark the Fire,&quot; which he produced. It will be broadcast, as if it&#x2019;s happening live, on Carson Daly&#x2019;s New Year&#x2019;s Eve special. Before he goes on, Team Pharrell retreats to a dressing room. His assistant, Cactus, is there, along with his art director, Phi, and Fatima, the beautiful choreographer. I ask Pharrell: Why do you surround yourself with women? Not to engage in racial/genre profiling or anything, but the world of hip-hop is dominated by artists surrounded by great clouds of pot smoke and testosterone.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.x">&quot;Women have a way of expressing themselves that I can relate to more honestly,&quot; he says. &quot;I am a sensitive person, so I want to be with sensitive people.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.y">He looks meaningfully around the room. &quot;They&#x2019;re pretty magical, the women that are here. They sense things before it happens.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>12:30 a.m.</strong> <strong>Glenwood Place Studios, Burbank</strong></p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.10">The night ends at a recording studio built into a little house. Lots of succulents and aloe plants, a little fountain, the sense that someone might offer you a fresh young coconut smoothie or a bong rip at any moment. The women of Pharrell are crashed on sofas in another room. Pharrell himself is seated at a studio console, eating chicken soup and working on a song he&#x2019;s writing for Snoop and Gwen Stefani. The song sounds pretty dope. I&#x2019;m not going to try to describe it, but in honor of Pharrell&#x2019;s synesthesia, I&#x2019;ll say: It sounds bright green.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.11">Pharrell, besides being a pop star in his own right, is kind of a musical McKinsey consultant for other artists. You come to him when you need a hit, and he&#x2019;ll guide you toward it, toward your &quot;twinkling star.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.12">&quot;It begins like an interview,&quot; he says. &quot;And then the interview just turns into music. And sometimes it&#x2019;s not even talking; it&#x2019;s just the vibe. The vibe paints the room.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.13">Okay, I say, what vibe am I painting the room with? Without really looking up, he delivers a devastatingly precise evaluation of the contents of my soul: You wear plain clothes but have a very complicated interior; you don&#x2019;t like to glamorize yourself; you&#x2019;re intense and highly observant and hard on yourself and probably others. I feel instantly like he gets me. That&#x2019;s what you sign up for with Pharrell, besides hit songs: He understands you; you feel okay being vulnerable with him.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.14">Don&#x2019;t you ever get sick of producing content? I ask. It&#x2019;s a fucking long day. Singing songs for warmed-up studio audiences over and over. Writing songs. Planning to write songs. Don&#x2019;t you think the world is increasingly insatiable and impatient? Don&#x2019;t you ever get sick of being a slave to that?</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.15">&quot;I am only a slave to my curiosity,&quot; he says. Pharrell is the musician for his time. Not just because everyone wants to record songs with him, but because the amount of content required to keep people&#x2019;s attention, to feel <em>relevant,</em> is increasing mercilessly. The condition suits Pharrell. He can write fast; he wrote &quot;Blurred Lines&quot; in half an hour. And he never seems to want to stop. He&#x2019;s like some Greek-myth-type figure, suspended in an act of constant creation, his brain just plugged into the Matrix and a beautiful, terrifying, constant stream of content pouring out.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.16">He&#x2019;s got the song going now. It&#x2019;s not finished, but it&#x2019;s alive, set in motion, waddling out there into the world on its own two feet, Pharrell following behind adding riffs and effects, clapping and singing <em>Ooh, ooh, ooh</em> and listening to it curiously, as if only now himself discovering its nature.</p><p data-reactid=".r1iwus55og.1.1.0.0.4.17"><strong><a href="../contributors/devin-friedman">DEVIN
