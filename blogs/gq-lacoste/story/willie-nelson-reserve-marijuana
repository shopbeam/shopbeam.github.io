  	    "articleBody": "\u0022I\u0027ve bought a lot of pot in my life,\u0022 Willie Nelson tells me, \u0022and now I\u0027m selling it back.\u0022\u000A\u000AWillie Nelson has this kind of answer—stock, pithy—for all kinds of questions, and he\u0027s been using them for decades. Bring up his brief abortive stint at college studying business administration? Invariably he\u0027ll soon say, \u0022I majored in dominoes.\u0022 Mention the massive sum he owed the IRS in the early \u002790s—somewhere between $17 million and $32 million—and you\u0027ll get the one about how it isn\u0027t so much \u0022if you say it real fast.\u0022\u000A\u000AAs time passes, the world offers up new questions, and so sometimes new answers are required. Once he reached the age when people began asking about retirement, Nelson would reply that he doesn\u0027t do anything but play music and golf: \u0022I wouldn\u0027t know what to quit.\u0022 And now that one of America\u0027s stoner icons is going into the pot business and planning to launch his own proprietary brand called Willie\u0027s Reserve, this bought-a-lot-of-pot-in-my-life line is already on instant replay and you can confidently expect to hear Nelson use it for the next few years, anytime the subject is raised in his vicinity. In fact when we first meet, on the tour bus where he likes to do interviews and live much of his life, less than ninety seconds pass before he deploys it.\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a lot of shade and space behind answers like these. They leave people feeling like they\u0027ve had a funny and intimate encounter with someone who, as Willie Nelson does, knows how to deliver them—with an amiable mischievous half-smile and a wizened wink in his eye, as though the words have just popped into his head. Answers that charm and entertain but also leave his real thoughts unbothered, his real life unruffled.\u000A\u000AWillie Nelson has plenty of real thoughts, and he has lived a life as real and unreal as they come for eighty-two years and counting. Those stories are a little harder to shake loose, but he will share some of them, too. And when it comes to Willie Nelson, it\u0027s worth holding out for the good stuff.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AMaybe all of us are engaged in a lifelong fight to find our better natures. But some of us, perhaps the luckiest ones, find a reliable shortcut. For Willie Nelson, that shortcut has turned out to be pot. It works for him, and he needed it. His public image is a kind of Zen cowboy, a naturally chilled-out elder—Robin Williams used to have a bit in his act about how even Buddha was jealous of how mellow Willie Nelson was—but of course the truth is more complicated. \u0022I can be a real asshole when I\u0027m straight,\u0022 he tells me. \u0022As Annie can probably adhere to.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnnie is Nelson\u0027s fourth wife—\u0022my current wife,\u0022 as he has sometimes described her, though they have now been married for twenty-four years. She sits out of my sight, behind me, but periodically she contributes to the conversation. \u0022He\u0027s not an asshole sober,\u0022 she clarifies, coming to her husband\u0027s defense. Briefly, at least. \u0022Only when he\u0027s drinking. Then he\u0027s an asshole.\u0022\u000A\u000ADid you think you were an asshole at the time?\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, I\u0027ve always known that possibility, you know,\u0022 he says. \u0022I saw a funny cartoon the other day. ‘How do you piss off a redhead?\u0027 ‘Say something.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AAnd you felt like some anger came with your red hair?\u000A\u000A\u0022I could associate with the temper that goes with it.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo are you still as angry as you used to be, but now that you smoke you\u0027ve just learned how to not show it?\u000A\u000A\u0022Probably. I still get pissed off, and take a couple of hits and say, ‘Well, it ain\u0027t that bad.…\u0027 Delete and fast-forward: That\u0027s my new motto.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022It works,\u0022 Annie attests.\u000A\u000AHow long\u0027s that been the motto?\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, six months,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AWhat kind of things can annoy you?\u000A\u000A\u0022Life itself, you know. If you start going over the way things are and you don\u0027t get pissed off, you just haven\u0027t studied the facts yet.\u0022 He laughs.\u000A\u000ASo, overall, you\u0027re proposing that one should study the facts, get pissed off, and then smoke and get un-pissed off?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. Delete and fast-forward, start over again. Admit that you\u0027re an asshole and move on.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve said that you\u0027re naturally a little too revved up, and that pot brings you back closer to normal.\u000A\u000AHe nods. \u0022I have compared myself to the motorboat where the fuel for the motorboat is a little too hot for the motor, where you have to add a little oil in it. I figure that\u0027s my oil, you know. It\u0027s what I have to do to, you know, to make it easier.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd what happens to the motorboat without the oil?\u000A\u000A\u0022Burns out,\u0022 says Annie.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. It wears out. And he does dumb and dumber things.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022The motorboat stays a redhead,\u0022 says Annie.\u000A\u000ADo you ever drink at all now?\u000A\u000A\u0022Very rarely. If you got a drink, I\u0027ll take a drink. But no, I don\u0027t like me drinking.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhy do you think it had that effect on you?\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t know, I\u0027ve got a lot of Indian blood in me, and something true is that Indians can\u0027t do alcohol. So I start out knowing that. My drummer, Paul, we\u0027ve been together for a long time, and back in my drinking days whenever I\u0027d get too drunk and out of order, he\u0027d roll up a joint and hand it and I\u0027d take a couple hits and pass out. So he knew how to handle me.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s said that you always wanted to drive cars when you were drunk.\u000A\u000ANelson\u0027s eyes light up. \u0022Yeah. And see how fast they would go.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s really not a good idea.\u000A\u000A\u0022Thank you.\u0022 He laughs. \u0022No, you\u0027re right.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou crashed a few?\u000A\u000A\u0022A couple.\u0022\u000A\u000ASomeone once said—and I think it was you—that it was maybe a hundred.\u000A\u000A\u0022Couple. I don\u0027t know. Quite a few.\u0022\u000A\u000ANever got hurt?\u000A\u000A\u0022Never got killed. Lucky. Never killed nobody. Lucky. Very, very lucky.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhy do you think you had the impulse to do that?\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t know. I was always a kind of go-fast guy, you know.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd what are you now?\u000A\u000A\u0022I still am a go-fast guy, but I know that and I try to guard against my instincts a little better.\u0022\u000A\u000ADoes it still come out behind the wheel?\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, I have a pickup truck—\u0022 he begins.\u000A\u000A\u0022Don\u0027t get in it,\u0022 Annie interjects.\u000A\u000A\u0022—and I\u0027ve got a ranch down there with a bunch of roads on it and a lot of cedar trees and it\u0027s…\u0022 He grins. \u0022I have to take you for a ride in my truck sometime.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Don\u0027t do it,\u0022 Annie advises. \u0022It\u0027s a bad idea.\u0022\u000A\u000ADo people get scared?\u000A\u000AHe looks gleeful at the thought. \u0022Hopefully. That\u0027s the whole point of it. You take people out and scare the shit out of ‘em. It\u0027s just fun, you know.\u0022 He laughs again.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve got an interesting sense of fun.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. You see why I smoke a lot. I\u0027ve got to calm that out.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhen it comes to explaining how Nelson is, he\u0027ll often go all the way back to the small Texas town, Abbott, in which he was raised after he and his elder sister, Bobbie, were left by their warring parents to live with their grandparents. It\u0027s fair to say that he grew up in a way few people still do.\u000A\u000A\u0022You know, all we did in Abbott,\u0022 he explains, \u0022was fuck, fight, and throw rocks.\u0022\u000A\u000AThrow rocks?\u000A\u000A\u0022That was all we had to do in Abbott,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AWhat would you throw them at?\u000A\u000A\u0022Tin cans. Or at each other, you know. We used to have BB-gun fights—we\u0027d put on leather jackets and shoot each other with BB guns. We were kind of bored. We used to go fight bumblebees on Sunday, go home with our eyes swollen shut for being stung. That\u0027s young and stupid, but fun.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo: fuck, fight, throw rocks…and fight bees. And right from the start, the young Willie Nelson would also smoke. As the Second World War fomented in Europe, he was already experimenting. \u0022Anything you could roll up,\u0022 he recalls, \u0022I would try to smoke it. I don\u0027t know why.\u0022 As a kid, he cast the net of the potentially tokable indiscriminately wide. One early mistake was the bark of cedar trees.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s a little harsh,\u0022 he concedes now. \u0022It tastes exactly like it sounds. It\u0027s too harsh. And after a couple of drags of it you say, ‘Maybe not.\u0027 \u0022  \u000A\u000ASo he tried grapevine.\u000A\u000A\u0022Not as harsh as the cedar bark,\u0022 he considers, \u0022but it was harsh.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd then there was the one inadvisable occasion when he tried to smoke some herbal laxatives known as black draughts.\u000A\u000A\u0022Bad,\u0022 he remembers. \u0022Terrible. Not as harsh, but still no good.\u0022 A momentary grin. \u0022I was regular for a day or two.\u0022\u000A\u000ASoon he graduated to cigarettes, at first ones he\u0027d scavenge off the floor. An improvement. \u0022I said, ‘Well, this is better than cedar bark,\u0027 \u0022 he remembers.\u000A\u000AImprobably, Nelson believes that he tried pot for the first time when he was 11 or 12, though he didn\u0027t realize it until much later on. \u0022I was with a cousin of mine, he was about 15. He had asthma and the doctors gave him a cigarette to smoke. An asthma cigarette. And he offered me a puff off it, and I didn\u0027t particularly care for it so I handed it back to him. But years later, when I smoked my first what-I-knew-was-marijuana, I said, ‘Wait a minute—I\u0027ve had this before.\u0027 And it took me right back to my cousin with the asthma cigarette.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat seems like weird medicine for asthma—I ask whether it worked for his cousin.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah,\u0022 he replies, as though the notion that a joint would be the best medical treatment for asthma were the least unlikely part of the story. \u0022Oh yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhen Willie Nelson first started touring he used to stay in hotels, but many years ago he realized that he preferred life here on the bus. Now, even when the bus is parked outside a hotel for the night and everyone else goes in, he stays on board. He has slept on this bus, and on its four predecessors, maybe six months of the year for the past thirty or forty years. \u0022Got everything I need,\u0022 he says. \u0022Shower, stove, an icebox, a computer, radio, TV. It\u0027s been my home for a long time.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe likes being on the bus and he likes being on the move. \u0022Every place gets old after a while,\u0022 he explains. \u0022I have a nice home in Maui, and even that…you know, I get a little anxious to go away after a while. I just like to travel. That\u0027s what I do. I just enjoy moving. It\u0027s really hard for me to stay somewhere—I have to get up and go somewhere.\u0022 He also has a home near Austin, and he even owns a house in Abbott, but he is usually to be found somewhere else. \u0022I\u0027ve got a lot of Gypsy blood in me, I think,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s not much fonder of lingering in his own past. When I ruffle one too many uncomfortable memories, he halts me. \u0022Nothing to be gained by bringing up all that horseshit again.\u0022 He gestures to a copy of his latest ghosted autobiography, It\u0027s a Long Story, which was published earlier this year. \u0022Have you read the book?\u0022 he asks.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestNelson has lived half the year on his tour bus for nearly half his life; the number of joints he\u0027s blazed on board is impossible to quantify.2005 Getty Images\u000A\u000AOf course, I say. (And not just that. The collected Willie Nelson library is quite large—even setting aside the unofficial books, there\u0027s also an earlier autobiography, three books of reminiscences and advice and jokes, his ghosted Western novel, and his monograph about the benefits of biodiesel.)\u000A\u000AHe smiles. \u0022I\u0027ll get around to it one day.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou haven\u0027t read it?\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s too big,\u0022 he says. \u0022Too long. At some point somewhere in the past I remember most of it. But to me it\u0027s a funny story.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat do you mean?\u000A\u000A\u0022You know, the fact that I\u0027m still here talking to you about it and you give a damn. I\u0027m 82 years old. Lot of people my age are in a home somewhere. So I\u0027m very fortunate, and why I don\u0027t know, but I don\u0027t question it. I figure this is the way it\u0027s supposed to be, and I just enjoy it.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe first time Nelson tried pot as an adult, in the mid-\u002760s, he was unmoved. He was playing in a band in Fort Worth and the fiddle player offered him a hit. \u0022I didn\u0027t like it,\u0022 he remembers. \u0022Didn\u0027t care for it. Of course, I was smoking cigarettes, one after the other. I didn\u0027t even get anything—like, puff and puff and nothing and nothing.\u0022 He\u0027d tell people that pot gave him a headache.\u000A\u000AEventually, as the world knows, he came round. When I ask him what he eventually felt that he hadn\u0027t felt before, he deflects. \u0022I have trouble remembering yesterday,\u0022 he says. (This endlessly adaptable brush-off has been his charming go-to non-answer for years.) I ask whether he doesn\u0027t even foggily remember.\u000A\u000A\u0022I wasn\u0027t enjoying smoking cigarettes,\u0022 he says. \u0022It\u0027s really that simple. I was getting nothing from a cigarette except pneumonia and cancer. And at least from a hit off a joint I got a little brief high off of it.\u0022 And at this point he chooses to digress, in a way that is both revealing and uncharacteristically immodest. \u0022I have a huge tolerance for pot. I can probably smoke with anybody anywhere. Me and Snoop Dogg had a smoke-off in Amsterdam and he crawled away.\u0022\u000A\u000AAh, yes. The legendary First Willie-Snoop Amsterdam Smoke-off. I have listened to a history of this encounter as described by the loser. Snoop Dogg explained how he brought along a blunt only to discover that Nelson already had a joint, a vape pen, and a pipe up and running, and that Nelson simply rotated among all four.\u000A\u000AI ask Nelson whether this is true.\u000A\u000A\u0022As stupid as it sounds, it\u0027s probably true. We had a lot of fun.\u0022\u000A\u000ADo you normally quadruple up like that?\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, I don\u0027t have any set of rules that I follow when I\u0027m smoking. If you have one, I\u0027ll take a hit.\u0022\u000A\u000AIs four types at once your maximum?\u000A\u000AHe looks at me as though for just a moment he thinks I might be bearing a surprise that could enrich his life. \u0022Have you got another one?\u0022 he asks. Sadly, I can only disappoint. \u0022I\u0027ll try any of them,\u0022 he says. \u0022Whatever way you can smoke it or take it, I\u0027m for it.\u0022\u000A\u000AAs this story suggests, it turns out that Nelson is still fairly flexible when it comes to his pot consumption. I had read that he had taken up vaping some years ago and had given up smoking to save his lungs. \u0022I smoke a joint whenever I don\u0027t care if the smoke is out there,\u0022 he explains, \u0022but if there\u0027s people and I don\u0027t want to offend, I\u0027ll take a vaporizer.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022And he eats candy or has oil at night for sleeping,\u0022 Annie clarifies.\u000A\u000AIf Nelson doesn\u0027t smoke or get his high somehow, at night there are consequences.\u000A\u000A\u0022I start having bad dreams,\u0022 he says. (He once described the price of abstention like this: \u0022You remember why you started smoking, to stop them crazy fucking dreams. Those crazy dreams that you never really get used to.\u0022)\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestWillie\u0027s Reserve is expected to hit stores this fall, though Nelson\u0027s own role in the company is more brand ambassador than official bud master.\u000A\u000AI ask him what he dreams about, but Annie answers first.\u000A\u000A\u0022Intruders, usually,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000A\u0022A lot of fighting,\u0022 he elaborates. \u0022Screaming and fighting. I wake up in the middle of the night, scaring the shit out of her.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s dangerous to sleep with him when he hasn\u0027t smoked,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000AI ask him whether he has any dreams at all when he does smoke.\u000A\u000A\u0022No,\u0022 he answers. \u0022No.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, you do,\u0022 says Annie.\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t have any negative dreams,\u0022 he clarifies.\u000A\u000A\u0022Right,\u0022 says Annie. \u0022He\u0027s usually playing music. He plays music, he plays his guitar. Otherwise he\u0027s kicking out and lashing out.\u0022 And she demonstrates how her husband lies on his back, fingering guitar parts with his hands, playing silent music from somewhere deep within him that no one will ever hear.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ANelson first found success as a songwriter, with songs like \u0022Night Life,\u0022 \u0022Funny How Time Slips Away,\u0022 and, most famously, the one recorded by Patsy Cline, \u0022Crazy.\u0022 (Legend has it that he wrote these three in one single week in 1959.) Those were just the tip of the iceberg, just three of the dozens of clever, elegant songs he wrote back then, dark lilting country poems suffused with misery and heartache. \u0022I wrote some of the saddest songs in the world,\u0022 he once said, and it was not an empty claim.\u000A\u000AAt first he seems to dodge when I mention this. \u0022Well, you know, the old love ballads, first of all people like them, and they seem to be commercial.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut all those songs, I persist, they were pretty heavy in what they described.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, yeah,\u0022 he says. \u0022I was going through all those marriages and divorces.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo, I ask, they came directly from what you were feeling?\u000A\u000A\u0022Sure.\u0022 This reminds him of something. \u0022I won\u0027t mention names, but there was one guy who recorded, his manager would tell him horrible things about his wife so that he would feel bad and write another heartbreaker. I thought that was pretty cruel.\u0022\u000A\u000AWillie didn\u0027t need the extra help. But in time he began to think that songs like these created a vortex, a spiral of sorrow from which it was difficult to escape.\u000A\u000A\u0022Sometimes I think that\u0027s why a lot of those singers out there drink so much,\u0022 he says. \u0022Because after you go out and sing those same old motherfucking songs every night, it puts them in that bad mood. And a lot of them, they\u0027re not a good enough actor to go in there and come out without being affected. So they drink a lot. And that\u0027s the beginning of the end, when you start having to drink to go do what you do. I think those old sad songs have a lot to do with it. It makes you want to cry, and then you want to drink, and then you want more sad songs—the one thing calls for the other.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe still sings some of his old ones, of course. \u0022I\u0027m not that highly emotional about anything,\u0022 he says, \u0022and so I feel like I can deliver the song—the lyric—without getting too involved.\u0022 He has been singing those three songs I mentioned the same way for over forty years, as a medley, usually quite early in the set. He says that he\u0027ll play a couple of new songs at a show like tonight\u0027s. (This evening he will sing outdoors in Bend, Oregon, though until he steps out of the bus, he could be anywhere.) \u0022Other than that I\u0027ll just kind of coast through the show,\u0022 he says. It\u0027s pretty much the same most nights: Among old Hank Williams covers, gospel songs, and a Django Reinhardt instrumental, there\u0027ll be those three songs from the ‘50s, something with a fuck-you lyric that chugs along from when he grew his hair and became part of the outlaw country movement in the early ‘70s (\u0022Me and Paul,\u0022 a travelogue that, among other things, details an early near-drug-bust in Laredo), one of the old-time covers that sent his career to new heights in the late ‘70s (\u0022Georgia on My Mind\u0022), hits from the pop heyday that followed (\u0022Always on My Mind,\u0022 \u0022On the Road Again,\u0022 \u0022Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground\u0022), and maybe the recent pot anthem \u0022Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die\u0022 to accompany the new \u0022It\u0027s All Going to Pot.\u0022 Aside from those couple of new songs, very little has changed in the past thirty years, and he sees no reason that it should. \u0022If they show up,\u0022 he argues, \u0022you\u0027re doing it right.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo in some ways a Willie Nelson show is one of the most predictable pieces of mainstream musical theater imaginable. And yet, at the same time, it is also deeply strange. Nelson\u0027s vocal phrasing has always been unusual for country music, sliding over the beat, rushing to and from it in capricious ways, and that tendency has only become more pronounced as time has passed. And his guitar playing is, at times, even more extraordinary—skittering and juddering and lurching, little runs of notes that accelerate, then slow down, like a man speaking a language no one else knows, pacing himself by an erratic metronome. In short bursts, the sound he makes is as close to some kind of Japanese avant-garde art-metal as it is to middle-of-the-road country music. He seems pleased and amused when I touch on this subject, as though it\u0027s something he takes private pleasure in. \u0022I like to surprise myself on the guitar,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s quite a performance. Often, by the way he plays and the way he sings, he can make a song sound as though it\u0027s teetering on the brink of collapse—only, of course, that\u0027s part of the larger trick, because then you realize that he has created a situation where he is the only person in the world who can, and will, save it.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOne Willie Nelson weed story is more famous than all the others, though some key details about it have always remained unclear. It took place during Jimmy Carter\u0027s administration.\u000A\u000AFamously, you smoked on the roof of the White House.\u000A\u000A\u0022I heard that somewhere,\u0022 he replies.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re always coy about it. Why?\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, I don\u0027t know,\u0022 he says. \u0022I\u0027m trying to find out who that was with me up there. I keep asking people. Wasn\u0027t me and you, was it?\u0022\u000A\u000ANelson has told this story in his autobiographies and cagily acknowledged it in endless TV interviews. In his 1988 autobiography he describes being up there \u0022with a beer in one hand and a fat Austin Torpedo in the other,\u0022 enjoying a view you can get from nowhere else of how Washington\u0027s principal streets fan out from the White House. In the 2015 version he describes \u0022a friend of mine who happened to be a White House insider\u0022 coming to his bedroom door at the end of the night and offering him a private tour, which took them to the roof:\u000A\u000ATo top things off, my friend pulled out a joint.\u000A\u000A\u0022Think it\u0027s time to burn one, Willie, if you don\u0027t object.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Think it\u0027s cool?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022If it wasn\u0027t, I wouldn\u0027t be offering.\u0022\u000A\u000ANelson has always declined to identify his accomplice in mischief. But I\u0027ve spent the past few weeks immersed in Nelson\u0027s life, and having picked off little clues from all that\u0027s been written and said over the years, I feel like I might have a pretty good idea. And what Nelson has just said to me seems like an open invitation to chance it.\u000A\u000AI kind of reckon I know who it was.\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, you know who it was?\u0022 He says this in what seems like a gently mocking whisper.\u000A\u000AWasn\u0027t it Jimmy Carter\u0027s middle son, Chip?\u000A\u000AAnd then there\u0027s a pause, not too long, but long enough that I feel pretty sure he wasn\u0027t expecting this name. And long enough that I know the name is right. But then—and maybe there\u0027s just a quarter of a second of delete/fast-forward, and a decision is made that there\u0027s no longer any point in getting too hung up about this—he rolls amiably on with the conversation.\u000A\u000A\u0022Looked a lot like,\u0022 he says. \u0022Could have been, yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhy have you always been shy about saying?\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, it ain\u0027t something you want to brag about, you know.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen you were up there, did you think this is a big deal, this is kind of naughty, or…?\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, not at the time. It seemed like the thing to do. We were there, and there it was, and uh…why not, you know? And they have a great view from the roof.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut it must have been a good story to tell people.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, I don\u0027t really go around bragging about that. It happened, and it\u0027s something that I don\u0027t deny, you know, but I don\u0027t bring it up all the time.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022But it wasn\u0027t you who said it to begin with,\u0022 Annie points out. (These events predate Annie, but she clearly knows the inside story.)\u000A\u000A\u0022No, it wasn\u0027t me who leaked it,\u0022 says Willie.\u000A\u000A\u0022It was probably Chip,\u0022 says Annie.\u000A\u000A\u0022You know, he probably told somewhere, laughing about it,\u0022 says Willie.\u000A\u000ADid you mind that people knew?\u000A\u000A\u0022No, I don\u0027t mind it, no. At all.\u0022\u000A\u000ADid you worry it would embarrass the president at the time?\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, I think he knew me and he knew Chip so, you know, there wasn\u0027t much we could do to embarrass him.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd so there it is: one minor mystery from the Carter administration solved. A few afternoons later, I telephone James Earl \u0022Chip\u0022 Carter III, now 65 years old, at his home in Decatur, Georgia. He answers the phone and listens as I explain: that I have been talking to Nelson for this article about that famous night on the White House roof, and that Nelson did not volunteer his name, but when he realized I had worked it out, he had talked to me about it.\u000A\u000AAt first Carter seems to, very briefly, laugh.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well,\u0022 he says, \u0022he told me not to ever tell anybody.\u0022\u000A\u000AI tell Carter that I believe the cat is now out of the bag.\u000A\u000A\u0022Okay,\u0022 he says evenly.\u000A\u000AThen I continue, inquiring whether I can ask him some more about what happened.\u000A\u000A\u0022No,\u0022 he says. \u0022No, you can\u0027t. Thank you.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd that is when James Earl Carter III hangs up.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFor someone with Nelson\u0027s experience, and for someone who is planning to launch his own brand of pot, you might think that he would have the very specific tastes and preferences of a connoisseur, but if this is the case, he is not keen to share.\u000A\u000A\u0022There\u0027s only two kinds,\u0022 he tells me. \u0022It\u0027s like sex—it\u0027s all good, but some\u0027s better.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd with pot, what differentiates the good and the better?\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, you\u0027ll know it when you smoke it, and you might not know it until you do. A good hit off a good joint and you know you don\u0027t have to smoke the whole thing. A good joint\u0027ll last me all day.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou haven\u0027t settled on particular favorites you like?\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, wherever I am there are favorites. You know, you got your Maui Wowie, you got your Humboldt County in California, and you got the purple, you know, uh, in Florida…lot of different places that have their own brand that\u0027s from the area. The growers and the farmers around can tell you what grows best in their area.\u0022\u000A\u000AI know a lot of people who avoid some of the modern stuff that\u0027s just too strong for them.\u000A\u000A\u0022Really?\u0022 says Willie, his attention perking up. \u0022I\u0027m looking for that.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve never found any too strong?\u000A\u000A\u0022No,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A\u0022No, that\u0027s not true,\u0022 Annie tells him. \u0022You found a couple of those really strong ones…\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I found some of it that was really, really strong,\u0022 he disagrees. \u0022But too strong? No.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022His resistance is better than yours,\u0022 Mickey Raphael, Nelson\u0027s longtime harmonica player, who\u0027s been listening in on our conversation, points out.\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s the difference,\u0022 says Willie. \u0022I\u0027ve been smoking cedar bark.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027d beg to have the shit he throws away,\u0022 says Raphael.\u000A\u000AIs there any stoned that\u0027s too stoned?\u000A\u000A\u0022Too stoned?\u0022 Nelson repeats. \u0022I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know what too stoned is.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Well,\u0022 says Annie, \u0022that time I found you in the back when my brother brought that purple African something and you were laying on the floor with your feet on the bed.\u0022 She laughs. \u0022And you said, ‘I\u0027m too high.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AHe nods in acknowledgment. \u0022However, I think if I had to I could have got up, washed my face, and went and do a two-hour show.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You did,\u0022 she points out.\u000A\u000A\u0022By the time I get through ‘Whiskey River,\u0027 two or three songs, I\u0027m okay.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo when you think of the prime Willie\u0027s Reserve brand, are you able to describe what qualities you want it to have?\u000A\u000A\u0022No,\u0022 he says. \u0022You\u0027ll know it when you smoke it.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You want the shit that killed Elvis, is what you said,\u0022 prompts Raphael.\u000A\u000AWillie grins, glad to have been reminded. \u0022That\u0027s what I\u0027m looking for.\u0022\u000A\u000AHow hard have you looked?\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, how hard can you look, you know?\u0022 Willie says, smiling, as though there are things in life he has cared about more than this, but not too many.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIt is hard to work out just how involved Nelson is in Willie\u0027s Reserve. When I first ask him what he wants the company to be, he just says \u0022successful.\u0022 And other than mentioning that he wants to make sure that what they sell is \u0022the best quality,\u0022 that\u0027s about it. \u0022I don\u0027t know who first came up with that idea,\u0022 he says vaguely. \u0022Annie may have come up with the title, Willie\u0027s Reserve. I don\u0027t know exactly where that came from.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn an attempt to learn more, I speak with two people from the company, the CEO, Andrew Davison, and a vice president, Elizabeth Hogan. Davison explains that the first business meeting took place with Willie and Annie around the kitchen table at their ranch just outside Austin in March 2014, and presents the basic Willie\u0027s Reserve pitch: \u0022For fifty years he\u0027s been such an icon in this space that [for] everybody taking part in the artistic development of this plant over the last thirty, forty years, it\u0027s kind of their bucket list to get product to Willie. And so Willie\u0027s experienced the best cornucopia that has been grown over the decades and, you know, he really developed a legendary stash. And he\u0027s developed a point of view about how he feels about the category and how he feels about the product and how he feels about consumers. So it\u0027s taking that and distilling that vision and those values, translating that into the marketplace.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn fact, there won\u0027t be just one Willie\u0027s Reserve Legendary Stash. Far from it. This is business. Davison says that according to their research, consumers want \u0022high-quality flower,\u0022 concentrates, vape pens, and edibles, and so they \u0022envision going to a market with a variety and a collection of smokable products as well as concentrate products.\u0022\u000A\u000ANelson participated in a \u0022tasting\u0022 of Willie\u0027s Reserve in June, when he was brought ten different strains to smoke. Hogan says that Nelson sampled them over two days; she took notes on his comments and left him and Annie with a workbook to fill out thoughts as his research continued.\u000A\u000AI ask what conclusions were drawn.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, you know,\u0022 Hogan replies, \u0022Willie Nelson likes pot.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn truth, at least some of the key selections had already been made, and the impression she gives is that Nelson\u0027s views are more to be used in the packaging and marketing than in determining specific pot choices. This seems wise, because when I catch up with Nelson after this tasting, he is characteristically breezy about the experience—\u0022How bad a job can it be, testing the best weed in the world?\u0022—but sidesteps any expectation that he should be considered an expert. \u0022I think it all depends on the individual,\u0022 he says, \u0022and I\u0027ve been smoking weed a long time and I\u0027ve got a great tolerance for it, so whatever I say about it won\u0027t necessarily be the same thing that someone else would say, so I\u0027m not really the best guy to ask about those things.\u0022\u000A\u000ADavison says they hope that the first Willie\u0027s Reserve products will go on sale in Colorado and Washington \u0022by late fall or end of year.\u0022 Merle Haggard, who recently recorded the top ten Django and Jimmie album with Nelson, is optimistic about its prospects: \u0022I think he\u0027s got a new brand that will probably be bigger than Sir Walter Raleigh.\u0022 Typically, it is Nelson who dodges every opportunity to oversell it. He makes clear that while he\u0027s enthusiastic about Willie\u0027s Reserve, what really excites him is the wider evolution of society\u0027s attitude toward pot.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m just glad to see all this happening,\u0022 he says. \u0022Whether there\u0027s a Willie Reserve or not, that\u0027s not a big deal.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhen it comes to the benefits of the weed-lived life, Nelson\u0027s point of view is that he is an unscientifically representative sample of one. \u0022I\u0027m kinda like the canary in the mine,\u0022 he says. \u0022Here\u0027s the old fart, 82, out there doing an hour-and-a-half, two-hour show, remembering all the goddamn words—you know, he don\u0027t have a set list out or none of that shit out there. At least watch me and see what happens.\u0022 And so far the canary is thriving. Merle Haggard says that Nelson thinks they\u0027re both alive because of these lifestyle choices: \u0022The main thing is that we\u0027re both healthy. That\u0027s in contrast to what they say about people who indulge. He told me—and I don\u0027t disagree with him—that had we not smoked pot during our life, then we would probably be dead from drinking whiskey or smoking Camels.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen Willie Nelson first made records, he was clean-shaven and short-haired, and favored a suit and tie. He started growing his hair in the early 1970s, and for well over thirty years now he has been alternating between letting his long gray hair hang freely and wearing it in two braids. Recently some braids he cut off in the early 1980s were put up for auction, where it was explained that he had given them to Waylon Jennings at a sobriety party in 1983. Nelson says this isn\u0027t quite true—he cut them off in Maui and gave them to his manager and \u0022some way it got back to Waylon.\u0022 Either way, they were auctioned off as part of Jennings\u0027s estate and sold for $37,000.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s weird—very weird,\u0022 he comments, though you can tell by the way he says it that this doesn\u0027t even come close to some of the weirdness he has known.\u000A\u000AStill, it also made him realize that if everything goes wrong, at least he can feel safe knowing that the Willie Nelson emergency pension plan is close at hand, hanging down both sides of his ears.\u000A\u000AAs we talk, he fingers his right braid.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ve got six months of groceries right here,\u0022 he announces.\u000A\u000AAnd then he jiggles its twin, the braid that dangles down over his heart. That, he explains, is the best side. \u0022Things grow better over here,\u0022 he says. And, come the need and come the day, he reckons it\u0027d see him right in times of trouble, get him what he\u0027d really want.\u000A\u000A\u0022Two or three pounds,\u0022 he estimates, \u0022of good pot.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AChris Heath is a GQ correspondent.",

march toward full legalization would never have happened without Willie Nelson. He’s 82 now, and he’s spent nearly half his life as <em>America’s most famous stoner.</em> But this fall he’ll be making the leap from aficionado to entrepreneur. What Paul Newman did for tomato sauce, what Francis Coppola did for Cabernet, <em>Willie Nelson is hoping to do for weed</em></h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.0">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve bought a lot of pot in my life,&#x201D; Willie Nelson tells me, &#x201C;and now I&#x2019;m selling it back.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.1">Willie Nelson has this kind of answer&#x2014;stock, pithy&#x2014;for all kinds of questions, and he&#x2019;s been using them for decades. Bring up his brief abortive stint at college studying business administration? Invariably he&#x2019;ll soon say, &#x201C;I majored in dominoes.&#x201D; Mention the massive sum he owed the IRS in the early &#x2019;90s&#x2014;somewhere between $17 million and $32 million&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ll get the one about how it isn&#x2019;t so much &#x201C;if you say it real fast.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.2">As time passes, the world offers up new questions, and so sometimes new answers are required. Once he reached the age when people began asking about retirement, Nelson would reply that he doesn&#x2019;t do anything but play music and golf: &#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t know what to quit.&#x201D; And now that one of America&#x2019;s stoner icons is going into the pot business and planning to launch his own proprietary brand called Willie&#x2019;s Reserve, this bought-a-lot-of-pot-in-my-life line is already on instant replay and you can confidently expect to hear Nelson use it for the next few years, anytime the subject is raised in his vicinity. In fact when we first meet, on the tour bus where he likes to do interviews and live much of his life, less than ninety seconds pass before he <br>deploys it.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3">There&#x2019;s a lot of shade and space behind answers like these. They leave people feeling like they&#x2019;ve had a funny and intimate encounter with someone who, as Willie Nelson does, knows how to deliver them&#x2014;with an amiable mischievous half-smile and a wizened wink in his eye, as though the words have just popped into his head. Answers that charm and entertain but also leave his real thoughts unbothered, his real life unruffled.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5">Willie Nelson has plenty of real thoughts, and he has lived a life as real and unreal as they come for eighty-two years and counting. Those stories are a little harder to shake loose, but he will share some of them, too. And when it comes to Willie Nelson, it&#x2019;s worth holding out for the good stuff.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.6"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Maybe all of us are engaged in a lifelong fight to</strong> find our better natures. But some of us, perhaps the luckiest ones, find a reliable shortcut. For Willie Nelson, that shortcut has turned out to be pot. It works for him, and he needed it. His public image is a kind of Zen cowboy, a naturally chilled-out elder&#x2014;Robin Williams used to have a bit in his act about how even Buddha was jealous of how mellow Willie Nelson was&#x2014;but of course the truth is more complicated. &#x201C;I can be a real asshole when I&#x2019;m straight,&#x201D; he tells me. &#x201C;As Annie can probably adhere to.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.8">Annie is Nelson&#x2019;s fourth wife&#x2014;&#x201C;my current wife,&#x201D; as he has sometimes described her, though they have now been married for twenty-four years. She sits out of my sight, behind me, but periodically she contributes to the conversation. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s not an asshole sober,&#x201D; she clarifies, coming to her husband&#x2019;s defense. Briefly, at least. &#x201C;Only when he&#x2019;s drinking.

And right from the start, the young Willie Nelson would also smoke. As the Second World War fomented in Europe, he was already experimenting. &#x201C;Anything you could roll up,&#x201D; he recalls, &#x201C;I would try to smoke it. I don&#x2019;t know why.&#x201D; As a kid, he cast the net of the potentially tokable indiscriminately wide.

He had asthma and the doctors gave him a cigarette to smoke. An asthma cigarette. And he offered me a puff off it, and I didn&#x2019;t particularly care for it so I handed it back to him. But years later, when I smoked my first what-I-knew-was-marijuana, I said, &#x2018;Wait a minute&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve had this before.&#x2019; And it took me right back to my cousin with the asthma cigarette.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.1z">That seems like weird medicine for asthma&#x2014;I ask whether it worked for his cousin.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.20">&#x201C;Yeah,&#x201D; he replies, as though the notion that a joint would be the best medical treatment for asthma were the least unlikely part of the story. &#x201C;Oh yeah.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.21"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.22"><strong>When Willie Nelson first started touring he used to</strong> stay in hotels, but many years ago he realized that he preferred life here on the bus.

Those were just the tip of the iceberg, just three of the dozens of clever, elegant songs he wrote back then, dark lilting country poems suffused with misery and heartache. &#x201C;I wrote some of the saddest songs in the world,&#x201D; he once said, and it was not an empty claim.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.33">At first he seems to dodge when I mention this. &#x201C;Well, you know, the old love ballads, first of all people like them, and they seem to be commercial.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.34">But all those songs, I persist, they were pretty heavy in what they described.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.35">&#x201C;Well, yeah,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I was going through all those marriages and divorces.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.36">So, I ask, they came directly from what you were feeling?</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.37">&#x201C;Sure.&#x201D; This reminds him of something. &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t mention names, but there was one guy who recorded, his manager would tell him horrible things about his wife so that he would feel bad and write another heartbreaker. I thought that was pretty cruel.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.38">Willie didn&#x2019;t need the extra help. But in time he began to think that songs like these created a vortex, a spiral of sorrow from which it was difficult to escape.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.39">&#x201C;Sometimes I think that&#x2019;s why a lot of those singers out there drink so much,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Because after you go out and sing those same old motherfucking songs every night, it puts them in that bad mood. And a lot of them, they&#x2019;re not a good enough actor to go in there and come out without being affected. So they drink a lot. And that&#x2019;s the beginning of the end, when you start having to drink to go do what you do. I think those old sad songs have a lot to do with it. It makes you want to cry, and then you want to drink, and then you want more sad songs&#x2014;the one thing calls for the other.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3a">He still sings some of his old ones, of course. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not that highly emotional about anything,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;and so I feel like I can deliver the song&#x2014;the lyric&#x2014;without getting too involved.&#x201D; He has been singing those three songs I mentioned the same way for over forty years, as a medley, usually quite early in the set. He says that he&#x2019;ll play a couple of new songs at a show like tonight&#x2019;s. (This evening he will sing outdoors in Bend, Oregon, though until he steps out of the bus, he could be anywhere.) &#x201C;Other than that I&#x2019;ll just kind of coast through the show,&#x201D; he says. It&#x2019;s pretty much the same most nights: Among old Hank Williams covers, gospel songs, and a Django Reinhardt instrumental, there&#x2019;ll be those three songs from the &#x2018;50s, something with a fuck-you lyric that chugs along from when he grew his hair and became part of the outlaw country movement in the early &#x2018;70s (&#x201C;Me and Paul,&#x201D; a travelogue that, among other things, details an early near-drug-bust in Laredo), one of the old-time covers that sent his career to new heights in the late &#x2018;70s (&#x201C;Georgia on My Mind&#x201D;), hits from the pop heyday that followed (&#x201C;Always on My Mind,&#x201D; &#x201C;On the Road Again,&#x201D; &#x201C;Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground&#x201D;), and maybe the recent pot anthem &#x201C;Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die&#x201D; to accompany the new &#x201C;It&#x2019;s All Going to Pot.&#x201D; Aside from those couple of new songs, very little has changed in the past thirty years, and he sees no reason that it should. &#x201C;If they show up,&#x201D; he argues, &#x201C;you&#x2019;re doing it right.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3b">So in some ways a Willie Nelson show is one of the most predictable pieces of mainstream musical theater imaginable. And yet, at the same time, it is also deeply strange. Nelson&#x2019;s vocal phrasing has always been unusual for country music, sliding over the beat, rushing to and from it in capricious ways, and that tendency has only become more pronounced as time has passed. And his guitar playing is, at times, even more extraordinary&#x2014;skittering and juddering and lurching, little runs of notes that accelerate, then slow down, like a man speaking a language no one else knows, pacing himself by an erratic metronome. In short bursts, the sound he makes is as close to some kind of Japanese avant-garde art-metal as it is to middle-of-the-road country music. He seems pleased and amused when I touch on this subject, as though it&#x2019;s something he takes private pleasure in. &#x201C;I like to surprise myself on the guitar,&#x201D; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3c">It&#x2019;s quite a performance. Often, by the way he plays and the way he sings, he can make a song sound as though it&#x2019;s teetering on the brink of collapse&#x2014;only, of course, that&#x2019;s part of the larger trick, because then you realize that he has created a situation where he is the only person in the world who can, and will, save it.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3d"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55df4873f83274863bb0048b/master/w_768/WeedChart.jpg" alt="WeedChart.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwillie-nelson-reserve-marijuana&amp;t=WeedChart.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwillie-nelson-reserve-marijuana&amp;t=WeedChart.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwillie-nelson-reserve-marijuana&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55df4873f83274863bb0048b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FWeedChart.jpg&amp;description=WeedChart.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fwillie-nelson-reserve-marijuana&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55df4873f83274863bb0048b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FWeedChart.jpg&amp;description=WeedChart.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3e"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3f"><strong>One Willie Nelson weed story is more famous than</strong> all the others, though some key details about it have always remained unclear.

In his 1988 autobiography he describes being up there &#x201C;with a beer in one hand and a fat Austin Torpedo in the other,&#x201D; enjoying a view you can get from nowhere else of how Washington&#x2019;s principal streets fan out from the White House. In the 2015 version he describes &#x201C;a friend of mine who happened to be a White House insider&#x201D; coming to his bedroom door at the end of the night and offering him a private tour, which took them to the roof:</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3l">To top things off, my friend pulled out a joint.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3m">&#x201C;Think it&#x2019;s time to burn one, Willie, if you don&#x2019;t object.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3n">&#x201C;Think it&#x2019;s cool?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3o">&#x201C;If it wasn&#x2019;t, I wouldn&#x2019;t be offering.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3p">Nelson has always declined to identify his accomplice in mischief. But I&#x2019;ve spent the past few weeks immersed in Nelson&#x2019;s life, and having picked off little clues from all that&#x2019;s been written and said over the years, I feel like I might have a pretty good idea. And what Nelson has just said to me seems like an open invitation to chance it.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3q"><em>I kind of reckon I know who it was.</em></p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3r">&#x201C;Oh, you know who it was?&#x201D; He says this in what seems like a gently mocking whisper.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3s"><em>Wasn&#x2019;t it Jimmy Carter&#x2019;s middle son, Chip?</em></p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.3t">And then there&#x2019;s a pause, not too long, but long enough that I feel pretty sure he wasn&#x2019;t expecting this name.

A few afternoons later, I telephone James Earl &#x201C;Chip&#x201D; Carter III, now 65 years old, at his home in Decatur, Georgia. He answers the phone and listens as I explain: that I have been talking to Nelson for this article about that famous night on the White House roof, and that Nelson did not volunteer his name, but when he realized I had worked it out, he had talked to me about it.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.4a">At first Carter seems to, very briefly, laugh.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.4b">&#x201C;Well,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;he told me not to ever tell anybody.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.4c">I tell Carter that I believe the cat is now out of the bag.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.4d">&#x201C;Okay,&#x201D; he says evenly.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.4e">Then I continue, inquiring whether I can ask him some more about what happened.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.4f">&#x201C;No,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;No, you can&#x2019;t.

When I first ask him what he wants the company to be, he just says &#x201C;successful.&#x201D; And other than mentioning that he wants to make sure that what they sell is &#x201C;the best quality,&#x201D; that&#x2019;s about it. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know who first came up with that idea,&#x201D; he says vaguely. &#x201C;Annie may have come up with the title, Willie&#x2019;s Reserve. I don&#x2019;t know exactly where that came from.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5b">In an attempt to learn more, I speak with two people from the company, the CEO, Andrew Davison, and a vice president, Elizabeth Hogan. Davison explains that the first business meeting took place with Willie and Annie around the kitchen table at their ranch just outside Austin in March 2014, and presents the basic Willie&#x2019;s Reserve pitch: &#x201C;For fifty years he&#x2019;s been such an icon in this space that [for] everybody taking part in the artistic development of this plant over the last thirty, forty years, it&#x2019;s kind of their bucket list to get product to Willie. And so Willie&#x2019;s experienced the best cornucopia that has been grown over the decades and, you know, he really developed a legendary stash. And he&#x2019;s developed a point of view about how he feels about the category and how he feels about the product and how he feels about consumers. So it&#x2019;s taking that and distilling that vision and those values, translating that into the marketplace.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5c">In fact, there won&#x2019;t be just one Willie&#x2019;s Reserve Legendary Stash. Far from it. This is business. Davison says that according to their research, consumers want &#x201C;high-quality flower,&#x201D; concentrates, vape pens, and edibles, and so they &#x201C;envision going to a market with a variety and a collection of smokable products as well as concentrate products.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5d">Nelson participated in a &#x201C;tasting&#x201D; of Willie&#x2019;s Reserve in June, when he was brought ten different strains to smoke. Hogan says that Nelson sampled them over two days; she took notes on his comments and left him and Annie with a workbook to fill out thoughts as his research continued.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5e">I ask what conclusions were drawn.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5f">&#x201C;Well, you know,&#x201D; Hogan replies, &#x201C;Willie Nelson likes pot.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5g">In truth, at least some of the key selections had already been made, and the impression she gives is that Nelson&#x2019;s views are more to be used in the packaging and marketing than in determining specific pot choices. This seems wise, because when I catch up with Nelson after this tasting, he is characteristically breezy about the experience&#x2014;&#x201C;How bad a job can it be, testing the best weed in the world?&#x201D;&#x2014;but sidesteps any expectation that he should be considered an expert. &#x201C;I think it all depends on the individual,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;and I&#x2019;ve been smoking weed a long time and I&#x2019;ve got a great tolerance for it, so whatever I say about it won&#x2019;t necessarily be the same thing that someone else would say, so I&#x2019;m not really the best guy to ask about those things.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5h">Davison says they hope that the first Willie&#x2019;s Reserve products will go on sale in Colorado and Washington &#x201C;by late fall or end of year.&#x201D; Merle Haggard, who recently recorded the top ten <em>Django and Jimmie</em> album with Nelson, is optimistic about its prospects: &#x201C;I think he&#x2019;s got a new brand that will probably be bigger than Sir Walter Raleigh.&#x201D; Typically, it is Nelson who dodges every opportunity to oversell it. He makes clear that while he&#x2019;s enthusiastic about Willie&#x2019;s Reserve, what really excites him is the wider evolution of society&#x2019;s attitude toward pot.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5i">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m just glad to see all this happening,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Whether there&#x2019;s a Willie Reserve or not, that&#x2019;s not a big deal.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5j"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5k"><strong>When it comes to</strong> the benefits of the weed-lived life, Nelson&#x2019;s point of view is that he is an unscientifically representative sample of one. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m kinda like the canary in the mine,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Here&#x2019;s the old fart, 82, out there doing an hour-and-a-half, two-hour show, remembering all the goddamn words&#x2014;you know, he don&#x2019;t have a set list out or none of that shit out there. At least watch me and see what happens.&#x201D; And so far the canary is thriving. Merle Haggard says that Nelson thinks they&#x2019;re both alive because of these lifestyle choices: &#x201C;The main thing is that we&#x2019;re both healthy. That&#x2019;s in contrast to what they say about people who indulge. He told me&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t disagree with him&#x2014;that had we not smoked pot during our life, then we would probably be dead from drinking whiskey or smoking Camels.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5l">When Willie Nelson first made records, he was clean-shaven and short-haired, and favored a suit and tie. He started growing his hair in the early 1970s, and for well over thirty years now he has been alternating between letting his long gray hair hang freely and wearing it in two braids. Recently some braids he cut off in the early 1980s were put up for auction, where it was explained that he had given them to Waylon Jennings at a sobriety party in 1983. Nelson says this isn&#x2019;t quite true&#x2014;he cut them off in Maui and gave them to his manager and &#x201C;some way it got back to Waylon.&#x201D; Either way, they were auctioned off as part of Jennings&#x2019;s estate and sold for $37,000.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5m">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s weird&#x2014;very weird,&#x201D; he comments, though you can tell by the way he says it that this doesn&#x2019;t even come close to some of the weirdness he has known.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5n">Still, it also made him realize that if everything goes wrong, at least he can feel safe knowing that the Willie Nelson emergency pension plan is close at hand, hanging down both sides of his ears.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5o">As we talk, he fingers his right braid.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5p">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve got six months of groceries right here,&#x201D; he announces.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5q">And then he jiggles its twin, the braid that dangles down over his heart. That, he explains, is the best side. &#x201C;Things grow better over here,&#x201D; he says. And, come the need and come the day, he reckons it&#x2019;d see him right in times of trouble, get him what he&#x2019;d really want.</p><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5r">&#x201C;Two or three pounds,&#x201D; he estimates, &#x201C;of good pot.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5s"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".oedt0ivrpc.1.1.0.0.4.5t"><em>Chris Heath is a
