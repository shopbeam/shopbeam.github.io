  	    "articleBody": "Before we bring him in, maybe we can open the floor to some questions. This will be your first time meeting him. He\u0027s very comfortable with people evaluating him. Because right now he\u0027s being looked at almost as an experiment. Which he is. He\u0027s a human-subjects experiment.\u000A\u000ARichard Norris was 22 when he shot himself in the face. This was back in 1997. He doesn\u0027t remember how or why it happened, but his mom, who was three feet away, said it was an accident. She remembers pieces of Richard\u0027s face showering her body. This was in the living room. The gunshot had blown off his nose, cheekbones, lips, tongue, teeth, jaw, and chin, leaving just his wide brown eyes and a swirl of nameless twisted flesh.\u000A\u000AThe miracle that would come to define Richard\u0027s life begins with these tragic details. Like most miracles, with each retelling, the edges of the story sharpen, the colors become more vibrant, and the shadows disappear. Ashamed of his appearance, Richard became a hermit, living for nearly a decade on a foggy mountaintop in rural Virginia with his parents. They covered the mirrors in the house so Richard wouldn\u0027t have to look at his hideous face. He stayed in his room even to eat, wore a black mask on the rare occasions he came out. According to legend, one time the cops stopped him at gunpoint, mistaking him for a robber.\u000A\u000AThen one day, searching on the Internet, his mom found Eduardo Rodriguez, a Baltimore reconstructive facial surgeon. He promised Richard he would make him normal. Over the next few years, Rodriguez performed dozens of surgeries using Richard\u0027s own flesh, fashioning a nose-shaped appendage out of tissue from his forearm and a small chin out of flesh from his legs, but these crude approximations failed to make Richard normal. Meantime, Rodriguez had a grander idea in mind. He was driven to achieve perfection. He had been practicing face transplants on cadavers. What he envisioned for Richard was the most extensive transplant any surgeon had ever attempted: He would give Richard a whole new face.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s showtime,\u0022 Rodriguez said one day.\u000A\u000A\u0022You\u0027re my godsend,\u0022 Richard\u0027s mom said.\u000A\u000A\u0022Let\u0027s do this thing,\u0022 Richard said.\u000A\u000AThe surgery started at dawn on March 19, 2012. The face of a recently deceased 21-year-old man came off as one solid flap, skin, muscle, bone, nerves, blood vessels, tongue—everything as one piece. Rodriguez removed what was left of Richard\u0027s disfigured face, dissected down to the skull. He attached the new face midway back on Richard\u0027s scalp. He stabilized it with screws, tapped the jaw together, and finally draped the skin and sewed it down like a patch on a coat or a pair of jeans.\u000A\u000AYou can see the junction; the incision actually goes here in the coronal, extends in front of the ear, and goes posteriorly all the way down, uh, to the neck.\u000A\u000ARodriguez and his team worked nonstop for thirty-six hours, and when they were finished, Richard\u0027s mom looked at her son and felt like he was somehow resurrected. \u0022We have Richard back!\u0022 she said on the phone to Richard\u0027s dad, who had not had much of anything to say for many years.\u000A\u000AWith his new face, Richard, now 39, became a media sensation for a time, the story of the miracle told many times over until it hardened even in Richard\u0027s mind into a kind of precious jewel.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AMaybe we can scroll through some of the clinical photographs while we\u0027re talking. I feel very happy about the bony union here. That\u0027s the donor palate. And that\u0027s the donor floor mouth. The donor hair, it\u0027s a little darker than his. His is a little bit more salt-and-pepper.\u000A\u000AMost of the thirty or so people gathered in the conference room are wearing white coats or lanyards or both, and they sit visibly captivated by the photographs Rodriguez is describing. The mood is electric, scrambled, like a show on opening night. The pictures show Richard, who\u0027s waiting in an adjacent room for his cue to enter. The expectation lends an extra edge of drama to the presentation. He\u0027s flown up here to New York from the foggy mountaintop where he still lives, so that the assembled doctors and other clinicians at NYU Langone Medical Center can meet him.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Splash News/ Corbis\u000A\u000ARodriguez is an imposing figure, tall and broad, with a big dimple on his giant chin, wide pinstripes, cuff links, and unbuckled galoshes affecting a disheveled nonchalance. In the wake of his world-famous work on Richard, he was just named NYU\u0027s chair of plastic surgery, a substantial professional promotion (\u0022like I\u0027ve just been handed the keys to the starship Enterprise,\u0022 he told me). In part, he\u0027s been hired to get NYU into the face-transplant business, and today, as the hospital begins the process for its first one, he\u0027s brought his star patient before his new colleagues.\u000A\u000AOne of the things you\u0027ll notice is he has a couple of these scratches. He tends to pick and scratch a bit.\u000A\u000ASince the first face transplant, in 2005, only three American hospitals have performed the procedure. Many of the twenty-eight transplants were partial, sections of the face transplanted from deceased donors. Richard\u0027s transplant was a full face and is said to be the most ambitious ever. Rodriguez likens the medically complex procedure to the Apollo moon landing.\u000A\u000ASurgical difficulty aside, the fact that Richard didn\u0027t need a new face to survive raised an ethically grim question: Is a \u0022life-enhancing\u0022 surgery worth the risk? There was a good chance he\u0027d die—either on the operating table or later, if his body rejected the face. Of course, for people disfigured like Richard, the breakthrough represents something far beyond a mere enhancement. Here was new hope for millions of people disfigured by trauma, burns, disease, or birth defects. Wounded warriors suffering ballistic facial injuries would now have a surgical option that would go light-years beyond the currently available treatments. No more Band-Aid cosmetic surgeries. No more skin grafts that might only complicate your appearance. Now you could get rid of that face and replace it whole. \u0022We\u0027ve gone beyond the boundary of what we thought was even possible,\u0022 Rodriguez tells me.\u000A\u000AOne by one, some of the specialists in the conference room who had a chance to evaluate Richard earlier today stand up to speak of their findings. Concerns emerge, principally about Richard\u0027s state of mind. Has he become too emotionally attached to Rodriguez, the medical attention, the fame? What will happen to him now that Rodriguez has moved on to a new hospital, new face transplants, new miracles?\u000A\u000AWe were both struck by how good he looks and the really excellent aesthetic result.\u000A\u000AHe reported to me no chewing or swallowing problems.\u000A\u000AI was having trouble understanding him.\u000A\u000AI asked: Do people understand you? Are you mostly intelligible?\u000A\u000AHe hasn\u0027t done any ercises.\u000A\u000AHe said he just wants to move on, do his own thing.\u000A\u000AI think he\u0027s maybe overwhelmed, like you said.\u000A\u000AHe is not in any kind of psychotherapy.\u000A\u000AHe seems to have somewhat habituated to all the media attention.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s sort of had this Mick Jagger status.\u000A\u000AHe feels there\u0027s a sense of abandonment.\u000A\u000AI did not get the sense that he was open to therapy at this time.\u000A\u000AIn terms of any concerns about suicidality or low mood, severe depression, I would say that he denies it. I don\u0027t know fully if that\u0027s exactly accurate. I would want to speak with him again.\u000A\u000AWhen Rodriguez gives the nod, the door flies open and Richard saunters in, dressed in a bright purple Baltimore Ravens hat and jacket. He\u0027s been living with his new face for two years now, and he\u0027s undeniably attractive—clean-shaven, youthful, the kind of guy you would hire to run the front office. He takes a seat facing the crowd, arms splayed out, cool as Justin Bieber on a late-night talk show. Everyone stares at him, and some cock their heads. He\u0027s used to this; sometimes people applaud. Is he smiling? His new face doesn\u0027t move a lot. Does it move at all? He might be smiling, or it might just be the will of the room. His eyes, the one part of his original face still intact, dart like anyone\u0027s eyes, and I find myself chasing them, the only reliable clue as to what might really be going on in there.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOne of the things I wanted to know when I first reached out to Richard was how he felt about the miracle. What was it like to walk around with someone else\u0027s face? I thought it might be kind of unsettling, or confusing. You\u0027re chewing with another man\u0027s teeth? When I wrote to him to ask, he told me he had an agent. Cal Ripken\u0027s agent, he pointed out. He said everything about his new face was great. He has received thousands of letters from fans. One of the fans is now his girlfriend. She lives in New Orleans. He said he was planning to go meet her in person. He said he was in college now, wanted to focus on school, on being normal. Then he invited me to the foggy mountaintop. The fog was famous, he said, had recently made national news when it caused seventeen pileups involving ninety-five vehicles in one night.\u000A\u000AWhen I get there, the sun has already burned the fog off the morning, which is oddly disappointing. Richard\u0027s house isn\u0027t actually at the top of the mountain. There\u0027s a street carved about midway up with a dozen or so homes, and his is a small yellow double-wide with red trim, a carport, and a for sale sign out front. The storm door has a bear etched into the glass. Richard opens it and welcomes me inside. He\u0027s wearing a black Under Armour shirt and cargo pants and he\u0027s thin, old-man thin. His posture has curved into a slump from years of hanging his head low, from years spent feeling he was hideous to look at, so now he has to make a conscious effort to stand up straight.\u000A\u000AHe seems nervous. His hands tremble, bringing constant sips of water to his mouth. His lips can\u0027t quite grip the bottle, so each sip is more a little pour. He fights a constant drool with the help of a towel. His new face is a marvel nonetheless. It\u0027s a new face. Wide and open, the cheekbones of an Irishman and the wrinkle-free complexion of a college kid. It\u0027s difficult to reconcile the youthful face with the body of a man nearly 40. I am trying not to stare. I am trying to stop looking for the seams, where the new connects to the old, the eyelids, the neck, the scar in front of his ears. I am trying to stop thinking about his beard, which isn\u0027t really his beard, except now it is, and it grows. I\u0027m distracted by a thousand little thoughts like these. Coupled with his lack of facial expression—a solid, largely unmoving veneer—in all these ways the barrier to getting to know Richard feels to me immediately and appreciably steep. Microexpressions, split-second movements of the face, are said to communicate wide arrays of meaning. Even infants who are blind are said to use facial cues to tell their parents how they feel. You don\u0027t recognize how true these theories likely are until you are with someone with a face frozen in place.\u000A\u000A\u0022Here you go,\u0022 Richard says, picking up a DVD. It\u0027s a copy of the hour-long TV special Ann Curry did about him. He takes a Sharpie from his pocket, signs his name on the DVD, hands it to me.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a little bit awkward. I don\u0027t know where to begin. A face is a surprisingly intimate and complex subject. Part personal, part public. Partly a thing, partly an idea. Part physiology, part psychology.\u000A\u000AI spin the Ann Curry DVD on my finger.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ARichard leads me through the living room past his mother, who is on a recliner, staring into a laptop. She does not look up. He shows me his room. It\u0027s neat as a hotel. No clutter. Just pictures on the walls, every newspaper and magazine article ever written about him, each of them framed. \u0022They even did me on Ripley\u0027s Believe It or Not!,\u0022 he says, pointing to one of his clippings. \u0022In Japan I got rated in the top fifty miracles.\u0022\u000A\u000AI ask him about school, how it\u0027s going, how it feels to interact with students. Do they know he has a new face?\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t have any classes right now,\u0022 he says. His voice is muffled, like it\u0027s coming from the same place his eyes are, somewhere deep inside. New lips, new mouth, new tongue—it\u0027s remarkable he can form words at all. He says he\u0027s between classes. At the moment. Well, he isn\u0027t actually in school. He\u0027s taken some online courses. A lot of what Richard presents to the world is vague. The girlfriend. He says they\u0027re soul mates, but so far she\u0027s still just a Facebook profile. He says they text all the time. He can\u0027t wait to meet her in person.\u000A\u000AHe leads me back into the living room, where his mom is poking her keyboard angrily. He leaves me here. Two dachshunds sniff at my feet.\u000A\u000A\u0022So you like my two little wieners, huh?\u0022 his mom says to me, closing her laptop. She has a round face surrounded by gray curls, a soft neck, wide arms. \u0022That one is Raven and that one is Mark—after the race-car driver. She\u0027s spoiled rotten. Mark is, too. He\u0027s got cancer.\u0022\u000A\u000ARaven climbs a set of doggie steps up to the couch, digs intently at a blanket, around and around, until she has made herself a cocoon fully covering her body, with just her little nose popping out.\u000A\u000AI compliment Richard\u0027s mom on the house, the homey feeling, the beautiful views off the back deck.\u000A\u000A\u0022You want to buy it?\u0022 she asks. It was a mistake moving up here, she says. She never liked it, and neither did Richard. The old house, they gave it to Richard\u0027s sister, because she was having trouble making rent. \u0022We\u0027re below poverty line,\u0022 she says. She invites me to sit down on an adjacent recliner. \u0022I have fibromyalgia,\u0022 she says. \u0022That\u0027s why I have these heated blankets.\u0022\u000A\u000ARichard comes back, carrying pill bottles. \u0022This is what I take every day,\u0022 he says. \u0022These are my pills.\u0022 It\u0027s a five-pill maintenance regimen he\u0027ll need to keep up for the rest of his life; his body will always regard his new face as a foreign object, prompting his immune system to constantly attack it. The drugs trick the immune system by kicking it into its lowest possible gear. This leaves Richard vulnerable to every conceivable health problem down the line. Cancer, diabetes—all the majors.\u000A\u000A\u0022He\u0027s not supposed to smoke,\u0022 his mom says. He can\u0027t get sunburn. He can\u0027t get a cold. He can\u0027t drink. He can\u0027t fall and risk injury. He can\u0027t afford to tax his immune system at all. Even a cut could trigger rejection. It starts as a blotchy rash; it means his body is winning the fight to reject the transplant, and Richard has to be flown to the hospital to receive rounds of emergency drugs intravenously. Uncontrollable rejection would mean an almost certain death; the only things left of Richard\u0027s old face are his eyes and the back of his throat. Everything else is now gone for good. \u0022I have to keep watch that his face doesn\u0027t go yellow,\u0022 his mom says. \u0022He\u0027s had two rejections so far.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ll leave you two talking,\u0022 Richard says, and he heads outside for a smoke.\u000A\u000AHis mom motions toward the mantel on the fireplace, where two framed photographs stand side by side. One is Richard\u0027s high school portrait. The other is Josh, the 21-year-old donor, who used to have the face Richard now has.\u000A\u000A\u0022Isn\u0027t that amazing?\u0022 she says of the resemblance.\u000A\u000AIt really is. I don\u0027t know which is which, who is which, or what. Pronoun problems emerge. I didn\u0027t know Richard as a young man, and now the young face of one is attached to the aged body of the other.\u000A\u000A\u0022The likeness?\u0022 she says. \u0022It\u0027s Richard.\u0022 She tells me she met Josh\u0027s mom, visited her at her home. \u0022Real down-to-earth person. I said, \u0027I really like your kitchen.\u0027 That was the kitchen I wanted. Island in the middle of it. Her cabinets had glass in them. I said, \u0027I\u0027m gonna have to get Eddie to make me a kitchen like that.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AEddie is Richard\u0027s dad. He used to be a long-haul trucker, but he had to quit when he started needing insulin. He was not in favor of the idea of Richard getting a face transplant. \u0022I like your regular face,\u0022 he said at the time. Richard\u0027s mom told him to back off. \u0022It\u0027s Richard\u0027s choice,\u0022 she said. Rodriguez told Richard and his parents that the surgery would be extremely risky—it would take a day and a half—and that Richard would have only a 50 percent chance of surviving it. \u0022And he told us that if the face transplant didn\u0027t take, Richard would die because there would be nothing of his old face left,\u0022 his mother tells me. \u0022But it worked out great.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI ask her if she thinks Richard has changed since his surgery. Does she see a big difference in his personality?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, he gets out a little more than what he did,\u0022 she says. Which still isn\u0027t a whole lot. He can\u0027t drive, because he could have seizures. She can\u0027t drive on account of her fibromyalgia. So the two of them are mostly stuck here, dependent on Eddie.\u000A\u000AI lean up in the recliner, stretch my legs out straight. Right now this story is not screaming: miracle.\u000A\u000A\u0022What Richard is, he\u0027s a lab rat,\u0022 she says. \u0022He gets to be a brat sometimes. Gets on my nerves so bad. I\u0027ve always told my kids I don\u0027t care if I\u0027m 95 years old, if you do something I don\u0027t think you should, I\u0027ll climb up on a chair and I\u0027ll slap you good.\u0022\u000A\u000AI ask her what she means by \u0022lab rat,\u0022 and she says exactly that: an animal people do experiments on. \u0022Lab rat,\u0022 she says. \u0022I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll ever be able to work like in a normal life. He spends his time in hospitals, everybody poking and prodding, studying him. A boss don\u0027t want somebody that\u0027s gonna be absent 99 percent of the time.\u0022\u000A\u000AShe says Richard doesn\u0027t complain about being a lab rat. He\u0027ll do anything for Rodriguez, and so will she.\u000A\u000A\u0022Did you meet Dr. Rodriguez?\u0022 she asks me. \u0022Me and the nurses, we said, \u0027Yeah, he sure is good candy-looking stuff.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARodriguez, 47, didn\u0027t start out wanting to be great. Or not this great. He was in dental school. His parents had emigrated from Cuba. A Miami drill, fill, and bill dentist—that was his destination.\u000A\u000AHe speaks in the present tense when he talks about his past. \u0022It\u0027s this pursuit of understanding,\u0022 he tells me, sucking on a peppermint. \u0022Pursuit of knowledge.\u0022 He tells me about medical school after dental school. General surgery. Plastic surgery. Microsurgery. \u0022Pursuit of being better. Aim for excellence. I think humility is an important factor.\u0022 He discovered in himself all the components of a star surgeon, and he could not quiet his urge to learn: \u0022Like being in a library and you keep looking, and it leads you to another thing and you keep going.\u0022 Soon he\u0027s in surgery heaven, in Taipei, Taiwan, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a mecca for craniofacial and microsurgery, ninety-nine operating rooms, reattaching fingers, attaching toes to hands, round-the-clock microsurgery, free flaps—taking tissue from one part of a person\u0027s body and attaching it to another—a hundred free flaps every single month. \u0022Crank it up,\u0022 Rodriguez tells me, bouncing his head with the memory. \u0022Push and push and push.\u0022\u000A\u000AEventually he comes home, accepts a post in Baltimore at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. \u0022Now I\u0027m treating soldiers. Gunshot wounds. Explosions,\u0022 he tells me. He\u0027s fixing faces. A guy needs a nose; Rodriguez takes flesh from his leg and makes him a nose, a chin, a cheek. \u0022Everything is, like, happening now. These patients start coming out of the woodwork. \u0027There\u0027s this crazy guy in Baltimore; I think he might help you.\u0027 It\u0027s like Doctor Dolittle. People just come from everywhere.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut there are limitations, sculpture-wise, when it comes to making a nose. It would be so much better to put a real nose on someone. People had of course been doing organ transplants for years. But a face is a whole new ball game.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AA face isn\u0027t an organ, like a liver or a heart. A face is muscles, nerves, bones, and skin. A face is more like a hand or a foot. These kinds of transplants, composite-tissue transplants, sparked a fiery ethical debate from the beginning, back in 1998, when the first successful hand transplant occurred. This sort of surgery was, after all, elective surgery. Would it be worth the risk that a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs would present? Composite-tissue transplantation became a reality when Clint Hallam, a 48-year-old man from New Zealand, got a new hand that was bigger and pinker than his other hand. But it was a hand. If they could do a hand, what about a face? Should they?\u000A\u000AHallam\u0027s own experience was not particularly encouraging. The new hand freaked him out. One hand his, one hand somebody else\u0027s. He couldn\u0027t handle it. \u0022Take if off,\u0022 he said to his doctors. They refused. He persisted. They refused. So he stopped taking his meds, hid the hand from view so no one could tell what was happening to it. Doctors ended up having to amputate what was left. A mess. How stupid can you get? Hallam, they said, was a psychopath. Physical rejection may be a conundrum, but psychological rejection was the stuff of madmen.\u000A\u000AIn 2003, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and a year later, a national ethics committee in France, said that face transplantation would be going too far. The risk of complication would far outweigh the benefits. A new hand might be a reversible decision. But a new face? Once you take your old face off, you\u0027re committed. You live your whole life like that, taking medications to keep your new face on so you don\u0027t die. All this, for elective surgery?\u000A\u000ANevertheless, the first face transplant was performed in France in 2005. It caught the surgical world by surprise. It was a partial, a triangle. The nose and lips from a deceased donor were removed and sewn onto a woman whose face had been bitten off by a dog. Everyone had thought the first face transplant would be done in the U.S. Just a year earlier, the Cleveland Clinic had gotten ethical approval and had started testing prospective patients. But then France did it first, and the worldwide race to do something bigger, better, was on.\u000A\u000AMeanwhile, Rodriguez—with all the cowboys in his field now talking face transplants—is imagining something bolder than what\u0027s been tried. He\u0027s practicing on cadavers, taking the face off one and putting it on another, not just the triangle but the whole face. He isn\u0027t sure about the procedure. Could he do it? Like a fighter pilot on a flight simulator, he practices the surgery on his computer. He\u0027s got all his training behind him, and all the technology before him, and he\u0027s looking at Richard. He\u0027s looking at two or three other people who might be good candidates. \u0022But I\u0027m not totally convinced yet,\u0022 he tells me, still engrossed in the unfolding dramatization of his life. \u0022I\u0027m apprehensive about it. I think it\u0027s a big deal. Taking someone\u0027s face off.\u0022 There is no turning back once you do something like that. The old face is mangled and useless; you can\u0027t put it back on. \u0022I\u0027m thinking about it very systematically.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe tells me about going to Paris, having lunch with Pascal Coler, a 30-year-old man who got a new face in 2008. Coler had lived with big tumors all over his face. A terrible life. \u0022And I have a very good steak tartare,\u0022 Rodriguez says. \u0022And next to me is Pascal, chowing down the biggest porterhouse. As normal as can be. No one looks at him. He has a job, a potential girlfriend. I\u0027m like, holy mackerel, this is huge. We\u0027ve gone beyond clinical; now we can change someone\u0027s life.\u0022\u000A\u000AI want to ask Rodriguez how one patient who seemed reasonably content during one meal is enough to quiet an entire internal moral crisis, but he\u0027s on fast-forward, the adventure playing out like an action movie.\u000A\u000A\u0022Let\u0027s go!\u0022 he tells me. \u0022It\u0027s on!\u0022\u000A\u000ASo in Baltimore, a team of five surgeons are mobilized—two to work on the donor, three on Richard—and the operating rooms are readied. \u0022I go, \u0027Richard, if you want to pull the plug right now, do it,\u0027 \u0022 says Rodriguez. \u0022 \u0027I don\u0027t want you to feel any pressure; there\u0027s a lot going on here, and I just need you to tell me right now if you\u0027re ready, and if you aren\u0027t, we just walk away and it\u0027s all good.\u0027\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A The World\u0027s Most Daring Transplant\u000A\u000A The surgery, which started with incisions from Richard\u0027s scalp to his neck, began at dawn on March 19, 2012, and continued nonstop for the next thirty-six hours.\u000A Richard\u0027s old face was removed to expose his skull, eye sockets, and throat and neck muscles.\u000A The donor face was applied in one solid piece that included the jaw, tongue, muscles, skin, nose, teeth, and eyelids.\u000AHammers and saws were used to shape Richard\u0027s new jaw. Metal plates stabilized the donor face and allowed doctors to attach it to Richard\u0027s skull with screws.\u000A\u000A\u0022He said, \u0027Let\u0027s go. We\u0027re doing it.\u0027 That\u0027s it. You get yourself in your mental game. It\u0027s fourth and goal, and we are going into the end zone. We\u0027re going to win the Super Bowl. This is the moment of no return. Complete silence in the room; like, holy mackerel. Tough moment. No failure. This is it. We\u0027re going to make this thing. The face is one unit. I\u0027m picking it up. I\u0027m laying it on him. I\u0027ve got to get everything centered, it can\u0027t be off-kilter, the nose has gotta be straight, everything\u0027s gotta land perfectly.\u000A\u000A\u0022Now, this organ is not receiving blood. It needs to receive blood. The longer it takes to receive blood increases the chance for acute rejection. We gotta get this thing drinking.\u000A\u000A\u0022Connecting the artery, then the vein, and then we release, and it really is like a miracle. Impressive. You see the blood just coming from the neck, crossing the lips. Seeing the nose—it\u0027s white and it turns pink, like normal flesh. It takes seconds. And now we\u0027re thinking, Okay, I can take a little breather, but we still have to push ahead, I have to get Richard out of the operating room. We still have to connect the nerves, a lot of nerves. We have to suture the inside of his mouth and tongue; everything has to be sutured. And fix the rest of the bones. Line up the soft tissue. Line up his hairline. Line up his eyebrows. Get the eyelids. So all that needs to happen.\u000A\u000A\u0022We\u0027re at about eighteen to twenty hours. We\u0027ve still got a lot to go. I predicted twenty-four to thirty-six hours. I think the unique thing about this face transplant is that it was so extensive and comprehensive. I say this very humble, up to that point, nothing of that level had been performed.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADoubt, when it comes to miracles, is like steam on a mirror. You have to wipe it off if you want to see anything. And what choice do you have? You\u0027ve already moved forward. You\u0027ve given a guy a new face. You\u0027ve gotten a new face. Your kid has a new face. There is no turning back.\u000A\u000AOne day on the foggy mountaintop, Richard and I get bored sitting around his house, so we decide to take a drive. He is a man of hard-earned platitudes. \u0022Sometimes God will put you on your back to make you look up. Sometimes you need that nudge.\u0022 He\u0027s grateful for his new face. He\u0027s grateful to Josh, the donor. Five other people are now living with organs from Josh. \u0022It helps you understand...I\u0027m not going to say the afterlife, but what you do here on earth and what you leave here on earth—it\u0027s totally two different things.\u0022 He tells me about his efforts to raise awareness for organ donation; he\u0027s become something of a national spokesman for the cause.\u000A\u000AIn the car, we talk about all the fun things we\u0027ll do on our drive. His sister lives about an hour away, in the house Richard grew up in, the house where this whole mess started fifteen years ago, when he shot himself in the face. We haven\u0027t talked much about the accident. He doesn\u0027t remember anything. Morning or night, nothing. \u0022It\u0027s just a cobweb.\u0022 He suggests we stop at a beautiful lookout place, too. First, though, he asks me to stop at a store. \u0022Something for my throat,\u0022 he says. He comes out of the store carrying a brown bag. We continue our journey, go up into the voluminous mountains rolling every which way you look.\u000A\u000AWe talk about cracked iPhones. He\u0027s going to start a business fixing cracked iPhones. We talk about his girlfriend. \u0022Melanie,\u0022 he says, pulling up a picture of her as if to offer proof. \u0022She\u0027s real.\u0022 He can\u0027t wait to meet her in person. We talk about being a lab rat. On this matter he says he\u0027s honored. In a way, his whole life has been volunteering. When he was in high school, he was a volunteer firefighter. Now, with his new face, doctors are learning so much about how to treat soldiers suffering ballistic facial injuries. He likes helping people. He likes giving people hope. \u0022A drop of hope can create an ocean,\u0022 he says. \u0022But a bucket of faith can create an entire world.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s true,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A\u0022My throat,\u0022 he says. We\u0027re getting higher, and my ears have popped. He\u0027s stretched out, relad. He reaches into the brown bag, pulls out a bottle of Wild Turkey.\u000A\u000A\u0022For my throat,\u0022 he says. He can\u0027t take over-the-counter medications, he says. Too risky with his meds. There\u0027s a backpack at his feet. He opens it, pulls out some tubing and a wide syringe, about a half-inch across, the kind you use to give medicine to horses.\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t like the taste,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AHe hooks the syringe to the tubing, lifts up his shirt. I think I\u0027m supposed to pretend this is not happening. I\u0027m driving. There\u0027s a port under his shirt, connected to his stomach. I was not aware of that. He hooks the tubing to the port, so now the fat syringe is standing straight up.\u000A\u000AHe opens the Wild Turkey and starts pouring.\u000A\u000A\u0022Richard, I don\u0027t think Dr. Rodriguez would want you doing this—\u0022\u000A\u000AAll this talk of risk, all the meds, no smoking, no drinking, no falling. A lab rat. Everything measured and quantified and documented.\u000A\u000AThe Wild Turkey isn\u0027t going down. It\u0027s clogged. He jiggles the syringe. Nothing is happening.\u000A\u000A\u0022Can you pull over?\u0022 he asks. \u0022This isn\u0027t working right.\u0022\u000A\u000AI pull over. There are no cars anywhere. We are deep into the mountain range.\u000A\u000AHe gets out, flips the syringe, emptying it. He gets back in and examines all the tubing, pinches this and that, allowing some stomach juices to squirt out.\u000A\u000A\u0022So that\u0027s how you eat?\u0022 I ask. \u0022You use the tube?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022No,\u0022 he says. He used to. He doesn\u0027t need it anymore.\u000A\u000AHe reconnects everything, pours again. The whiskey goes quickly inside him, like water down a drain.\u000A\u000AHe looks at me. \u0022This is how it\u0027s supposed to work.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022This is for your throat?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I can\u0027t take over-the-counter medication,\u0022 he says again.\u000A\u000AEverything about him is vague. Except this isn\u0027t vague. He refills the syringe, lets another round drain into him, and another. I don\u0027t know how much. It seems like a lot. I wonder what it will be like to be with a drunk Richard. I imagine his sister, the beautiful lookout place. It doesn\u0027t happen. Within five minutes he folds, like a shot animal folds, over himself, folded, eyes open, his body deflated, the tube hanging out, dignity depleted.\u000A\u000A\u0022Richard?\u0022 I say. \u0022Richard?\u0022 I shove his shoulder and nothing happens. He is dead. He is on my watch and he is dead. I hear gurgling. Breathing. He\u0027s on my watch and he is not dead.\u000A\u000AMy watch?\u000A\u000AThe breathing is going in his mouth and out his nose. I am studying his face to make sure air is moving. In his mouth. Out his nose. This didn\u0027t used to be his mouth or his nose. He can smell with that nose. He can chew food with a dead man\u0027s jaw and teeth. There is no denying how fantastic that is.\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t know where to go. I don\u0027t know one foggy mountaintop from another. I can\u0027t wake him up.\u000A\u000AI have his address in my GPS. I hit \u0022previous destination.\u0022 When we get to his house, I drag him out of the car, exactly the way you drag a drunk out of a car, one arm over my shoulder, little steps. I kick the etched bear on the storm door to open it.\u000A\u000A\u0022Hello? Hello?\u0022 I deposit him in his mom\u0027s recliner, wait for someone to come home, or for him to wake up.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOne day I ask Rodriguez how he picked Richard over the other candidates he had for his epic heroic story. \u0022I had developed a relationship with Richard, so I knew the kind of person he is,\u0022 he tells me. \u0022This is an individual that I can trust as someone that can really care for this gift. Keep in mind, someone had to die for him to receive this face. So there\u0027s a certain sense of responsibility and burden that I need to make sure that this is not going to be wasted. This has to be a responsible person that will share the precious gift and take this gift and make something with it, and of it.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022A lot of responsibility,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A\u0022A lot,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AI ask him if he thinks people can get overly invested in the happily-ever-after in his line of work.\u000A\u000A\u0022Of course,\u0022 he says. \u0022Of course.\u0022\u000A\u000AA recent article by Rodriguez in the medical journal The Lancet features before-and-after pictures of Richard. Side by side, the change is stunning, from a man with a mangled swirl of a face to regular guy. The more I look at the picture of Richard\u0027s disfigured face, the more I wish I knew it. His eyes are bigger, rounder, provide a wider window. His eyebrows are all mid up, one curved sharply, the other a gentle swoop, thick scars in between. His lower face is cartoonish, like a drawing of an old guy who took his dentures out. There is so much to find in this face, so many avenues of inquiry.\u000A\u000APatient selection, Rodriguez writes in The Lancet, is the key to success when it comes to face transplantation. \u0022Patient selection by a thorough screening process...serves as the best safeguard against ethical challenges,\u0022 he writes. \u0022Rigorous preoperative psychiatric and psychological selection of patients deemed to be stable, motivated, and compliant by a multidisciplinary team is a crucial determinant of a safe and rapid recovery.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe article looks back at all twenty-eight face transplants that have occurred and represents Rodriguez\u0027s full circle from doubt to certainty. Three people have died from complications. Everyone else is said to be doing great.\u000A\u000ANYU hospital issued a press release when the article was published, extolling Rodriguez\u0027s call for a \u0022moral imperative\u0022 to offer face transplants, the \u0022Mount Everest\u0022 of medical-surgical treatments.\u000A\u000AAnd yet while the debate about the ethics of face transplantation has shifted dramatically since the early days of harsh warnings against the procedure, researchers in a recent academic survey of the \u0022successful\u0022 transplants note a distinct paucity of data on the psychological outcomes for these patients, who, they point out, often suffer from PTSD, alcohol abuse, and opiate dependence as a result of the trauma leading to their initial disfigurement.\u000A\u000AAnother journal article, in Anthropology Today, considered the topic under the heading \u0022Ethical slippage and quiet death,\u0022 with Richard\u0027s picture occupying an entire page.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AI try to tell Richard\u0027s mom about the Wild Turkey, but this is a difficult conversation, and I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s the right thing to do. She\u0027s in her recliner, and she has a migraine hangover. The medicine leaves her woozy. Eddie is over there feeding Slim Jims to Mark and Raven. Richard is in his room.\u000A\u000A\u0022Richard isn\u0027t supposed to smoke,\u0022 I start.\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, I know,\u0022 she says. \u0022And you know, sometimes he drinks until he passes out.\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027m relieved, but not.\u000A\u000AShe talks about God. She talks about Rodriguez. Everything comes back to Rodriguez: \u0022My godsend.\u0022 That\u0027s a lot of pressure on a savior. I wonder what exactly happened back in 1997 when Richard shot himself in the face. In an e-book version of the story, Richard says he was blindingly drunk, had come home and become verbally abusive with his mom, who sent him to his room to sleep it off. That part appears to be true, according to a police report filed in the Henry County Sheriff\u0027s Office. But the rest of the story—that a shotgun happened to be tilted in a gun case and, upon coming out of his room, Richard was asked by his mom to straighten it, causing it to fire accidentally—appears to be apocryphal. According to the report: \u0022Mrs. Norris was standing in the doorway of Richard\u0027s bedroom; fussing at Richard about him wanting to go out again. Richard took a shotgun from his gun cabinet and told Mrs. Norris that he would just shoot himself. When Richard racked a shell into the shotgun\u0027s chamber, the gun fired.... There was what appeared to be human flesh, bone, and teeth on all four walls in Richard\u0027s bedroom.\u0022 Mrs. Norris told police, \u0022Richard\u0027s face exploded.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt would take fifteen years to fix what had gone wrong that night—or at least to try to.\u000A\u000A\u0022The really weird thing is, me and Richard\u0027s girlfriend found Dr. Rodriguez at the same time,\u0022 his mom tells me. She pulls her blankets up. I\u0027m sitting on the couch with Raven. Richard has joined us, is seated in the other recliner.\u000A\u000A\u0022Girlfriend?\u0022 I ask. Richard had a girlfriend before the transplant?\u000A\u000A\u0022She was looking online for doctors to help Richard same time I was,\u0022 his mom says. \u0022She found him same time as I did.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Wait, who is this?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022His girlfriend,\u0022 she says. \u0022Me and her could not get along.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Girlfriend?\u0022 I say, looking over at Richard.\u000A\u000A\u0022An old one,\u0022 he says. \u0022Old, old. She was going to college to be a nurse.\u0022\u000A\u000AI need a time-out. What year are we in? The accident happened in 1997. The new face didn\u0027t come until 2012.\u000A\u000A\u0022You had a girlfriend when you were disfigured?\u0022 I ask Richard.\u000A\u000A\u0022I lived with her,\u0022 he says. \u0022For two years.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022When you were disfigured?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022But I thought you were a hermit,\u0022 I say. What about the foggy mountaintop? The covered mirrors and the black mask?\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A How to Care For a Brand New Face\u000A\u000AGetting Richard Norris his new face wasn\u0027t easy. For starters, doctors needed a donor who wasn\u0027t just a favorable blood match but also had the proper skeletal features and skin color—they calculated only a 14 percent chance they\u0027d find one. Then there was the epic surgery that took a team of 150 people. Now Richard just needs to win the daily battle against his body\u0027s impulse to reject the face. Here\u0027s what that routine entails. —Christopher Swetala\u000A\u000A The First Days\u000A\u000ATo keep his highly sensitive face protected, Richard couldn\u0027t so much as shave or brush his teeth. Abrasive contact could have damaged the sutures holding together the incisions, and even a scratch could have caused dangerous swelling and irritation.\u000A\u000A The First Six Months\u000A\u000ARichard was given large doses of drugs to help suppress his immune system and blunt rejection. But in his weakened state, a simple cold sore could have left him gravely ill, so doctors also gave Richard things like antiviral medication so he could fight off infections we\u0027re all commonly exposed to when we do something as innocent as take a sip from a friend\u0027s Coke. Those drugs came with risks, too—Richard was monitored for signs of diabetes, arthritis, and kidney failure. At times, he was taking some thirty pills each day through a feeding tube to his stomach.\u000A\u000A The Rest of His Life\u000A\u000AThese days, Richard swallows three pills in the morning and two at night in order to keep his immune system at 50 percent strength—just enough to ward off common viral and bacteria infections but not so strong that his own antibodies attack his new face. In addition to avoiding things that tax his body—everything from the sun to cigarettes—Richard visits his doctors every month.\u000A\u000A\u0022This was during the whole stage of my disfigurement when I was working for race teams,\u0022 Richard says. \u0022When I was at the racetrack, it was like nobody didn\u0027t care. They didn\u0027t care what I looked like. Only thing they cared about was how good I could set that race car up.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You had a job? And a girlfriend? And an apartment? You were living a whole life?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo why did he need a new face? Why had he endured the complications involved in freeing him from disfigurement? The thirty-six-hour operation, a 50 percent chance of dying on the table, a life of anti-rejection medications. No sunburn. No falling. Watch out for yellow. Two rejections so far.\u000A\u000A\u0022I didn\u0027t like the girl,\u0022 his mom says. \u0022She tried to cut me out of everything.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere was a fight. At their apartment. Richard was convalescing after a surgery, and his mom came by. \u0022She wouldn\u0027t let me in to see Richard,\u0022 she says. \u0022So I went through her. And she told me, get out of her house, the doctor said nobody could see Richard. I said, \u0027I ain\u0027t just nobody, I\u0027m his mother. I\u0027m gonna see him.\u0027 I whopped her. And I had her on the floor. I just told her, I said, \u0027You don\u0027t take my son away from me. Nobody takes my son.\u0027 And she said, \u0027I\u0027m gonna call the law.\u0027 I said, \u0027Well, just call the law.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I got rid of her,\u0022 Richard says.\u000A\u000A\u0022Then we moved up here in 2005, away from everybody,\u0022 his mom says.\u000A\u000AWhich is right about the time they found Rodriguez.\u000A\u000A\u0022We don\u0027t like it here,\u0022 his mom says.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s the most boringest place on earth,\u0022 Richard says.\u000A\u000ABeing famous is better. One of Japan\u0027s top fifty miracles. And he was willing to go through with getting a new face. And there was all that salvation his mom needed. And the wounded warriors needed him. And humanity needed him. And having a new face is better than some old disfigured one. You can\u0027t argue with that.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARichard wishes Rodriguez had stayed in Baltimore. He doesn\u0027t like New York. But wherever in the world Rodriguez needs him, he\u0027ll be there. And yes, as to smoking, he shouldn\u0027t. And yes, the incident in the car? \u0022Uh-huh,\u0022 he says. There\u0027s a certain amount of self-medication, he says. \u0022But that\u0027s just self-medication.\u0022 We\u0027re at NYU again, and he\u0027s not exactly sure what today\u0027s event is. Some kind of fund-raiser, he thinks. We\u0027re in the waiting room. He looks great in his suit. \u0022I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll be very nice people,\u0022 he says. He likes people. He likes visiting patients. People come to talk to Rodriguez, or the team back in Baltimore, and Richard joins them. They want face transplants. They want to know what it\u0027s like. He tells them what it\u0027s like. He knows exactly how they feel. It\u0027s something positive he can do with his life. A face. \u0022This is what I am,\u0022 he tells me. \u0022There is nothing more important than a face.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe brings up Hallam, the guy with the hand. \u0022He couldn\u0027t take it, so he had to cut it off,\u0022 he says. \u0022So now they say, \u0027Is the face transplant going to have that identity crisis, too?\u0027 Well, if he does, we\u0027re screwed.\u0022\u000A\u000AA woman with curly dark hair peeks into the waiting room. \u0022We\u0027re ready!\u0022 she says. We head down the hall. Richard takes two steps into the conference room, and the people burst into spontaneous applause.\u000A\u000A\u0022Hi, Richard!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Hello, Richard!\u0022\u000A\u000ARodriguez sits at the head of the table. Pretty little cookies are laid out. \u0022This institute was made possible by these incredible people,\u0022 he says to Richard.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s our pleasure, Richard.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022God bless you.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You\u0027re very brave.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You\u0027re a real ambassador.\u0022\u000A\u000ARichard thanks them on behalf of all the people in the future who might be helped. \u0022A drop of hope can create an entire ocean,\u0022 he says. \u0022A little speck of faith can create a world. You give that speck of faith to them.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022He never really thought about himself in all of this,\u0022 Rodriguez says. \u0022He\u0027s always thought about helping the wounded warriors and the other people, and providing hope. He\u0027s a remarkable man.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022And they can do research on me as well,\u0022 Richard says.\u000A\u000AAnd that about wraps it up?\u000A\u000AA woman has a question. She has wide shoulders, blond hair.\u000A\u000A\u0022What about your family?\u0022 she says. \u0022Do they have therapeutic resources available to them to support you?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Actually, the support I get mainly is from therapists,\u0022 Richard says. \u0022They send me home with homework, give me ercises to practice, to help with my speech, my swallowing, you know. Physical therapy helps a whole lot, played a huge role in my recovery.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe woman tries again.\u000A\u000A\u0022Emotionally, did you feel you got the support you needed?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Emotionally I can get lab work done no matter where I am, if I\u0027m home, if I\u0027m in Baltimore. If I\u0027m here, I get it done here. That way the lab work is always current.\u0022\u000A\u000AI want to jump in here. I want to tell the woman with the questions about Wild Turkey, the poverty line, lab rats and wiener dogs, illness and violence.\u000A\u000ARodriguez jumps in. \u0022The answer is yes and no,\u0022 he says. \u0022This is a new field. Every transplant has to be well thought out. One thing that you can appreciate with Richard is there was not a step missed in this rehearsal and this practice. And now Richard is our ambassador, and he can help us.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You are one of the greatest people I\u0027ve ever met,\u0022 one in the crowd says to Richard.\u000A\u000A\u0022Terrific. So handsome.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Thank you,\u0022 Richard says, reaching for Rodriguez. \u0022It comes from his hands. His hands.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARichard calls me shortly before he heads to New Orleans to meet Melanie, the new girlfriend. I wish him well. I feel nervous for him, want her to be real. For all his guile, he\u0027s a trusting soul. And he needs a girlfriend or some companion to assist him through life. If there\u0027s a future for him, it is almost assuredly off the foggy mountaintop. But under whose watch? Who will drive him around? He\u0027s a science experiment. He\u0027s a lab rat. He\u0027s not a normal sort of boyfriend.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Courtesy of Richard Norris\u000A\u000AOne day Melanie appears on my Skype screen. She\u0027s real. She\u0027s lovely. Richard is sitting next to her, waving to me. He wipes constant drool with the help of a towel. She just came home from work and put a pot roast in the oven. Richard folded the laundry. She wants to care for him. She finds a well of kindness in him. She\u0027s been burned so many times. She says nothing about his medical-rock-star status, nothing about the drool. \u0022Why does anyone fall in love?\u0022 she says with a shrug, when I ask about the relationship. She\u0027s the first person I meet who talks about Richard as just a regular person. He\u0027s not: a miracle. He\u0027s not: a medical circus act. He\u0027s not: an ambassador of anything. He\u0027s a guy with barely a tick of a functioning immune system, thanks to the inexorable march forward of technology and a worldwide race for surgical glory. But for now, at least, she doesn\u0027t need to have that conversation. I get the sense she would have liked Richard with his old face just the same.\u000A\u000AIn short order she introduces Richard to her kids, her mom; everybody likes everybody. She meets Richard\u0027s mom by phone, and so far so good. One day she notices maybe a rash? \u0022What is that?\u0022 she asks Richard. \u0022I don\u0027t think it\u0027s anything,\u0022 he says. He doesn\u0027t want it to be anything. He\u0027s finally with her, and he wants to stay. \u0022I\u0027m worried,\u0022 she says. \u0022It\u0027s getting worse.\u0022 She takes a picture of the rash, insists that Richard send it to the doctors in Baltimore keeping track of his medical care.\u000A\u000A\u0022Get here,\u0022 they say. \u0022Next plane out.\u0022\u000A\u000AIf it\u0027s acute rejection and they can\u0027t reverse it, he dies.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s hospitalized for two weeks, pumped full of stuff to get the rejection under control, then sent back to the foggy mountaintop to recover.\u000A\u000A\u0022Come back,\u0022 Melanie tells him. \u0022Please come back. We\u0027ll eat crawfish. You\u0027ll wear your sunscreen. I\u0027ll keep you safe.\u0022\u000A\u000AJeanne Marie Laskas (@jmlaskas) is a GQ correspondent.",

Norris had a face too hideous to show. Then, one day, a maverick doctor gave him a miracle too fantastic to believe. Richard got a face transplant, a new life, and a new set of burdens too strange to predict. What&#39;s it like to live with a face that wasn&#39;t yours—and that may never quite be?</h2><div class="byline-top-flex" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3"><div class="grid" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0"><div class="row" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0"><div class="col col-sm-15" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0"><div class="component-byline byline single avatars" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0"><div class="byline-item" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author"><div class="component-contributor" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author.1:$0"><span class="byline-label" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author.1:$0.1">By </span><a class="byline-contributor-link" rel="author" href="../contributor/jeanne-marie-laskas" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.0:$author.1:$0.2">Jeanne Marie Laskas</a></div></div><time class="publish-date" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.0.0.1">August 27, 2014 8:00 pm</time></div></div><div class="col col-sm-5" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1"><div class="social-share-top" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0"><div class="component-social-share default" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=The%20New%20Face%20of%20Richard%20Norris" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=The%20New%20Face%20of%20Richard%20Norris" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook.0"><span class="icon" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook.0.0"></span><span class="label" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-facebook.0.1">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item twitter" data-href="https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20New%20Face%20of%20Richard%20Norris&amp;via=GQMagazine&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20New%20Face%20of%20Richard%20Norris&amp;via=GQMagazine&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter.0"><span class="icon" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter.0.0"></span><span class="label" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.1.3.0.0.1.0.0.0:$share-item-twitter.0.1">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.0"><em>Before we bring him in, maybe we can open the floor to some questions. This will be your first time meeting him. He&#x2019;s very comfortable with people evaluating him. Because right now he&#x2019;s being looked at almost as an experiment. Which he is. He&#x2019;s a human-subjects experiment.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1">Richard Norris was 22 when he shot himself in the face. This was back in 1997. He doesn&#x2019;t remember how or why it happened, but his mom, who was three feet away, said it was an accident. She remembers pieces of Richard&#x2019;s face showering her body. This was in the living room. The gunshot had blown off his nose, cheekbones, lips, tongue, teeth, jaw, and chin, leaving just his wide brown eyes and a swirl of nameless twisted flesh.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2">The miracle that would come to define Richard&#x2019;s life begins with these tragic details. Like most miracles, with each retelling, the edges of the story sharpen, the colors become more vibrant, and the shadows disappear. Ashamed of his appearance, Richard became a hermit, living for nearly a decade on a foggy mountaintop in rural Virginia with his parents. They covered the mirrors in the house so Richard wouldn&#x2019;t have to look at his hideous face. He stayed in his room even to eat, wore a black mask on the rare occasions he came out. According to legend, one time the cops stopped him at gunpoint, mistaking him for a robber.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3">Then one day, searching on the Internet, his mom found Eduardo Rodriguez, a Baltimore reconstructive facial surgeon. He promised Richard he would make him normal. Over the next few years, Rodriguez performed dozens of surgeries using Richard&#x2019;s own flesh, fashioning a nose-shaped appendage out of tissue from his forearm and a small chin out of flesh from his legs, but these crude approximations failed to make Richard normal. Meantime, Rodriguez had a grander idea in mind. He was driven to achieve perfection. He had been practicing face transplants on cadavers. What he envisioned for Richard was the most extensive transplant any surgeon had ever attempted: He would give Richard a whole new face.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5">&quot;It&#x2019;s showtime,&quot; Rodriguez said one day.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.6">&quot;You&#x2019;re my godsend,&quot; Richard&#x2019;s mom said.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.7">&quot;Let&#x2019;s do this thing,&quot; Richard said.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.8">The surgery started at dawn on March 19, 2012. The face of a recently deceased 21-year-old man came off as one solid flap, skin, muscle, bone, nerves, blood vessels, tongue&#x2014;everything as one piece. Rodriguez removed what was left of Richard&#x2019;s disfigured face, dissected down to the skull. He attached the new face midway back on Richard&#x2019;s scalp. He stabilized it with screws, tapped the jaw together, and finally draped the skin and sewed it down like a patch on a coat or a pair of jeans.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.9"><em>You can see the junction; the incision actually goes here in the coronal, extends in front of the ear, and goes posteriorly all the way down, uh, to the neck.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.a">Rodriguez and his team worked nonstop for thirty-six hours, and when they were finished, Richard&#x2019;s mom looked at her son and felt like he was somehow resurrected. &quot;We have Richard back!&quot; she said on the phone to Richard&#x2019;s dad, who had not had much of anything to say for many years.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.b">With his new face, Richard, now 39, became a media sensation for a time, the story of the miracle told many times over until it hardened even in Richard&#x2019;s mind into a kind of precious jewel.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.d"><em>Maybe we can scroll through some of the clinical photographs while we&#x2019;re talking. I feel very happy about the bony union here. That&#x2019;s the donor palate. And that&#x2019;s the donor floor mouth. The donor hair, it&#x2019;s a little darker than his. His is a little bit more salt-and-pepper.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.e">Most of the thirty or so people gathered in the conference room are wearing white coats or lanyards or both, and they sit visibly captivated by the photographs Rodriguez is describing. The mood is electric, scrambled, like a show on opening night. The pictures show Richard, who&#x2019;s waiting in an adjacent room for his cue to enter. The expectation lends an extra edge of drama to the presentation. He&#x2019;s flown up here to New York from the foggy mountaintop where he still lives, so that the assembled doctors and other clinicians at NYU Langone Medical Center can meet him.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.f"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583069609f0bee56440e5f0/master/w_806/life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-02.jpg" alt="life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069609f0bee56440e5f0%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-02.jpg&amp;description=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069609f0bee56440e5f0%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-02.jpg&amp;description=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Splash News/ Corbis</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.g">Rodriguez is an imposing figure, tall and broad, with a big dimple on his giant chin, wide pinstripes, cuff links, and unbuckled galoshes affecting a disheveled nonchalance. In the wake of his world-famous work on Richard, he was just named NYU&#x2019;s chair of plastic surgery, a substantial professional promotion (&quot;like I&#x2019;ve just been handed the keys to the starship <em>Enterprise</em>,&quot; he told me). In part, he&#x2019;s been hired to get NYU into the face-transplant business, and today, as the hospital begins the process for its first one, he&#x2019;s brought his star patient before his new colleagues.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.h"><em>One of the things you&#x2019;ll notice is he has a couple of these scratches. He tends to pick and scratch a bit.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.i">Since the first face transplant, in 2005, only three American hospitals have performed the procedure. Many of the twenty-eight transplants were partial, sections of the face transplanted from deceased donors. Richard&#x2019;s transplant was a full face and is said to be the most ambitious ever. Rodriguez likens the medically complex procedure to the Apollo moon landing.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.j">Surgical difficulty aside, the fact that Richard didn&#x2019;t need a new face to survive raised an ethically grim question: Is a &quot;life-enhancing&quot; surgery worth the risk? There was a good chance he&#x2019;d die&#x2014;either on the operating table or later, if his body rejected the face. Of course, for people disfigured like Richard, the breakthrough represents something far beyond a mere enhancement. Here was new hope for millions of people disfigured by trauma, burns, disease, or birth defects. Wounded warriors suffering ballistic facial injuries would now have a surgical option that would go light-years beyond the currently available treatments. No more Band-Aid cosmetic surgeries. No more skin grafts that might only complicate your appearance. Now you could get rid of that face and replace it whole. &quot;We&#x2019;ve gone beyond the boundary of what we thought was even possible,&quot; Rodriguez tells me.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.k">One by one, some of the specialists in the conference room who had a chance to evaluate Richard earlier today stand up to speak of their findings. Concerns emerge, principally about Richard&#x2019;s state of mind. Has he become too emotionally attached to Rodriguez, the medical attention, the fame? What will happen to him now that Rodriguez has moved on to a new hospital, new face transplants, new miracles?</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.l"><em>We were both struck by how good he looks and the really excellent aesthetic result.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.m"><em>He reported to me no chewing or swallowing problems.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.n"><em>I was having trouble understanding him.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.o"><em>I asked: Do people understand you? Are you mostly intelligible?</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.p"><em>He hasn&#x2019;t done any ercises.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.q"><em>He said he just wants to move on, do his own thing.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.r"><em>I think he&#x2019;s maybe overwhelmed, like you said.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.s"><em>He is not in any kind of psychotherapy.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.t"><em>He seems to have somewhat habituated to all the media attention.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.u"><em>He&#x2019;s sort of had this Mick Jagger status.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.v"><em>He feels there&#x2019;s a sense of abandonment.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.w"><em>I did not get the sense that he was open to therapy at this time.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.x"><em>In terms of any concerns about suicidality or low mood, severe depression, I would say that he denies it. I don&#x2019;t know fully if that&#x2019;s exactly accurate. I would want to speak with him again.</em></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.y">When Rodriguez gives the nod, the door flies open and Richard saunters in, dressed in a bright purple Baltimore Ravens hat and jacket. He&#x2019;s been living with his new face for two years now, and he&#x2019;s undeniably attractive&#x2014;clean-shaven, youthful, the kind of guy you would hire to run the front office. He takes a seat facing the crowd, arms splayed out, cool as Justin Bieber on a late-night talk show. Everyone stares at him, and some cock their heads. He&#x2019;s used to this; sometimes people applaud. Is he smiling? His new face doesn&#x2019;t move a lot. Does it move at all? He might be smiling, or it might just be the will of the room. His eyes, the one part of his original face still intact, dart like anyone&#x2019;s eyes, and I find myself chasing them, the only reliable clue as to what might really be going on in there.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.z"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.10">One of the things I wanted to know when I first reached out to Richard was how he felt about the miracle. What was it like to walk around with someone else&#x2019;s face? I thought it might be kind of unsettling, or confusing. You&#x2019;re chewing with another man&#x2019;s teeth? When I wrote to him to ask, he told me he had an agent. Cal Ripken&#x2019;s agent, he pointed out. He said everything about his new face was great. He has received thousands of letters from fans. One of the fans is now his girlfriend. She lives in New Orleans. He said he was planning to go meet her in person. He said he was in college now, wanted to focus on school, on being normal. Then he invited me to the foggy mountaintop. The fog was famous, he said, had recently made national news when it caused seventeen pileups involving ninety-five vehicles in one night.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.11">When I get there, the sun has already burned the fog off the morning, which is oddly disappointing. Richard&#x2019;s house isn&#x2019;t actually at the top of the mountain. There&#x2019;s a street carved about midway up with a dozen or so homes, and his is a small yellow double-wide with red trim, a carport, and a for sale sign out front. The storm door has a bear etched into the glass. Richard opens it and welcomes me inside. He&#x2019;s wearing a black Under Armour shirt and cargo pants and he&#x2019;s thin, old-man thin. His posture has curved into a slump from years of hanging his head low, from years spent feeling he was hideous to look at, so now he has to make a conscious effort to stand up straight.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.12">He seems nervous. His hands tremble, bringing constant sips of water to his mouth. His lips can&#x2019;t quite grip the bottle, so each sip is more a little pour. He fights a constant drool with the help of a towel. His new face is a marvel nonetheless. <em>It&#x2019;s a new face.</em> Wide and open, the cheekbones of an Irishman and the wrinkle-free complexion of a college kid. It&#x2019;s difficult to reconcile the youthful face with the body of a man nearly 40. I am trying not to stare. I am trying to stop looking for the seams, where the new connects to the old, the eyelids, the neck, the scar in front of his ears. I am trying to stop thinking about his beard, which isn&#x2019;t really <em>his</em> beard, except now it is, and it grows. I&#x2019;m distracted by a thousand little thoughts like these. Coupled with his lack of facial expression&#x2014;a solid, largely unmoving veneer&#x2014;in all these ways the barrier to getting to know Richard feels to me immediately and appreciably steep. Microexpressions, split-second movements of the face, are said to communicate wide arrays of meaning. Even infants who are blind are said to use facial cues to tell their parents how they feel. You don&#x2019;t recognize how true these theories likely are until you are with someone with a face frozen in place.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.13">&quot;Here you go,&quot; Richard says, picking up a DVD. It&#x2019;s a copy of the hour-long TV special Ann Curry did about him. He takes a Sharpie from his pocket, signs his name on the DVD, hands it to me.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.14">It&#x2019;s a little bit awkward. I don&#x2019;t know where to begin. A face is a surprisingly intimate and complex subject. Part personal, part public. Partly a thing, partly an idea. Part physiology, part psychology.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.15">I spin the Ann Curry DVD on my finger.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.16"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5583069609f0bee56440e5ed/master/w_806/life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-03.jpg" alt="life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069609f0bee56440e5ed%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-03.jpg&amp;description=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5583069609f0bee56440e5ed%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-03.jpg&amp;description=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.17">Richard leads me through the living room past his mother, who is on a recliner, staring into a laptop. She does not look up. He shows me his room. It&#x2019;s neat as a hotel. No clutter. Just pictures on the walls, every newspaper and magazine article ever written about him, each of them framed. &quot;They even did me on <em>Ripley&#x2019;s Believe It or Not!</em>,&quot; he says, pointing to one of his clippings. &quot;In Japan I got rated in the top fifty miracles.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.18">I ask him about school, how it&#x2019;s going, how it feels to interact with students.

His voice is muffled, like it&#x2019;s coming from the same place his eyes are, somewhere deep inside. New lips, new mouth, new tongue&#x2014;it&#x2019;s remarkable he can form words at all. He says he&#x2019;s between classes. At the moment. Well, he isn&#x2019;t actually in school. He&#x2019;s taken some online courses. A lot of what Richard presents to the world is vague. The girlfriend. He says they&#x2019;re soul mates, but so far she&#x2019;s still just a Facebook profile. He says they text all the time. He can&#x2019;t wait to meet her in person.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1a">He leads me back into the living room, where his mom is poking her keyboard angrily. He leaves me here.

She has a round face surrounded by gray curls, a soft neck, wide arms. &quot;That one is Raven and that one is Mark&#x2014;after the race-car driver. She&#x2019;s spoiled rotten. Mark is, too. He&#x2019;s got cancer.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1c">Raven climbs a set of doggie steps up to the couch, digs intently at a blanket, around and around, until she has made herself a cocoon fully covering her body, with just her little nose popping out.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1d">I compliment Richard&#x2019;s mom on the house, the homey feeling, the beautiful views off the back deck.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1e">&quot;You want to buy it?&quot; she asks. It was a mistake moving up here, she says. She never liked it, and neither did Richard. The old house, they gave it to Richard&#x2019;s sister, because she was having trouble making rent. &quot;We&#x2019;re below poverty line,&quot; she says. She invites me to sit down on an adjacent recliner. &quot;I have fibromyalgia,&quot; she says. &quot;That&#x2019;s why I have these heated blankets.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1f">Richard comes back, carrying pill bottles. &quot;This is what I take every day,&quot; he says. &quot;These are my pills.&quot; It&#x2019;s a five-pill maintenance regimen he&#x2019;ll need to keep up for the rest of his life; his body will always regard his new face as a foreign object, prompting his immune system to constantly attack it. The drugs trick the immune system by kicking it into its lowest possible gear. This leaves Richard vulnerable to every conceivable health problem down the line. Cancer, diabetes&#x2014;all the majors.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1g">&quot;He&#x2019;s not supposed to smoke,&quot; his mom says. He can&#x2019;t get sunburn. He can&#x2019;t get a cold. He can&#x2019;t drink. He can&#x2019;t fall and risk injury. He can&#x2019;t afford to tax his immune system at all. Even a cut could trigger rejection. It starts as a blotchy rash; it means his body is winning the fight to reject the transplant, and Richard has to be flown to the hospital to receive rounds of emergency drugs intravenously. Uncontrollable rejection would mean an almost certain death; the only things left of Richard&#x2019;s old face are his eyes and the back of his throat. Everything else is now gone for good. &quot;I have to keep watch that his face doesn&#x2019;t go yellow,&quot; his mom says. &quot;He&#x2019;s had two rejections so far.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1h">&quot;I&#x2019;ll leave you two talking,&quot; Richard says, and he heads outside for a smoke.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1i">His mom motions toward the mantel on the fireplace, where two framed photographs stand side by side. One is Richard&#x2019;s high school portrait. The other is Josh, the 21-year-old donor, who used to have the face Richard now has.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1j">&quot;Isn&#x2019;t that amazing?&quot; she says of the resemblance.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1k">It really is. I don&#x2019;t know which is which, who is which, or what. Pronoun problems emerge. I didn&#x2019;t know Richard as a young man, and now the young face of one is attached to the aged body of the other.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1l">&quot;The likeness?&quot; she says. &quot;It&#x2019;s <em>Richard.</em>&quot; She tells me she met Josh&#x2019;s mom, visited her at her home. &quot;Real down-to-earth person. I said, &#x2019;I really like your kitchen.&#x2019; That was the kitchen I wanted. Island in the middle of it. Her cabinets had glass in them. I said, &#x2019;I&#x2019;m gonna have to get Eddie to make me a kitchen like that.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1m">Eddie is Richard&#x2019;s dad. He used to be a long-haul trucker, but he had to quit when he started needing insulin. He was not in favor of the idea of Richard getting a face transplant. &quot;I like your regular face,&quot; he said at the time. Richard&#x2019;s mom told him to back off. &quot;It&#x2019;s Richard&#x2019;s choice,&quot; she said. Rodriguez told Richard and his parents that the surgery would be extremely risky&#x2014;it would take a day and a half&#x2014;and that Richard would have only a 50 percent chance of surviving it. &quot;And he told us that if the face transplant didn&#x2019;t take, Richard would die because there would be nothing of his old face left,&quot; his mother tells me. &quot;But it worked out great.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1n"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558306963655c24c6c956f1d/master/w_806/life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-04.jpg" alt="life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-04.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306963655c24c6c956f1d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-04.jpg&amp;description=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306963655c24c6c956f1d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-04.jpg&amp;description=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1o">I ask her if she thinks Richard has changed since his surgery.

He spends his time in hospitals, everybody poking and prodding, studying him.

Or not this great. He was in dental school. His parents had emigrated from Cuba. A Miami drill, fill, and bill dentist&#x2014;that was his destination.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1x">He speaks in the present tense when he talks about his past. &quot;It&#x2019;s this pursuit of understanding,&quot; he tells me, sucking on a peppermint. &quot;Pursuit of knowledge.&quot; He tells me about medical school after dental school. General surgery. Plastic surgery. Microsurgery. &quot;Pursuit of being better. Aim for excellence. I think humility is an important factor.&quot; He discovered in himself all the components of a star surgeon, and he could not quiet his urge to learn: &quot;Like being in a library and you keep looking, and it leads you to another thing and you keep going.&quot; Soon he&#x2019;s in surgery heaven, in Taipei, Taiwan, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a mecca for craniofacial and microsurgery, ninety-nine operating rooms, reattaching fingers, attaching toes to hands, round-the-clock microsurgery, free flaps&#x2014;taking tissue from one part of a person&#x2019;s body and attaching it to another&#x2014;<em>a hundred free flaps every single month.</em> &quot;Crank it up,&quot; Rodriguez tells me, bouncing his head with the memory. &quot;Push and push and push.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.1y">Eventually he comes home, accepts a post in Baltimore at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. &quot;Now I&#x2019;m treating soldiers.

A guy needs a nose; Rodriguez takes flesh from his leg and makes him a nose, a chin, a cheek. &quot;Everything is, like, happening now. These patients start coming out of the woodwork. &#x2019;There&#x2019;s this crazy guy in Baltimore; I think he might help you.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s like Doctor Dolittle.

A face is muscles, nerves, bones, and skin. A face is more like a hand or a foot. These kinds of transplants, composite-tissue transplants, sparked a fiery ethical debate from the beginning, back in 1998, when the first successful hand transplant occurred. This sort of surgery was, after all, elective surgery. Would it be worth the risk that a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs would present? Composite-tissue transplantation became a reality when Clint Hallam, a 48-year-old man from New Zealand, got a new hand that was bigger and pinker than his other hand. <em>But it was a hand.</em> If they could do a hand, what about a face? Should they?</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.22">Hallam&#x2019;s own experience was not particularly encouraging. The new hand freaked him out. One hand his, one hand somebody else&#x2019;s. He couldn&#x2019;t handle it. &quot;Take if off,&quot; he said to his doctors. They refused. He persisted. They refused. So he stopped taking his meds, hid the hand from view so no one could tell what was happening to it. Doctors ended up having to amputate what was left. A mess. <em>How stupid can you get?</em> Hallam, they said, was a psychopath. Physical rejection may be a conundrum, but psychological rejection was the stuff of madmen.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.23">In 2003, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and a year later, a national ethics committee in France, said that face transplantation would be going too far. The risk of complication would far outweigh the benefits. A new hand might be a reversible decision. But a new face? Once you take your old face off, you&#x2019;re committed. You live your whole life like that, taking medications to keep your new face on so you don&#x2019;t die. All this, for elective surgery?</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.24">Nevertheless, the first face transplant was performed in France in 2005. It caught the surgical world by surprise. It was a partial, a triangle. The nose and lips from a deceased donor were removed and sewn onto a woman whose face had been bitten off by a dog. Everyone had thought the first face transplant would be done in the U.S. Just a year earlier, the Cleveland Clinic had gotten ethical approval and had started testing prospective patients. But then France did it first, and the worldwide race to do something bigger, better, was on.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.25">Meanwhile, Rodriguez&#x2014;with all the cowboys in his field now talking face transplants&#x2014;is imagining something bolder than what&#x2019;s been tried. He&#x2019;s practicing on cadavers, taking the face off one and putting it on another, not just the triangle but the whole face. He isn&#x2019;t sure about the procedure. Could he do it? Like a fighter pilot on a flight simulator, he practices the surgery on his computer. He&#x2019;s got all his training behind him, and all the technology before him, and he&#x2019;s looking at Richard. He&#x2019;s looking at two or three other people who might be good candidates. &quot;But I&#x2019;m not totally convinced yet,&quot; he tells me, still engrossed in the unfolding dramatization of his life. &quot;I&#x2019;m apprehensive about it. I think it&#x2019;s a big deal. Taking someone&#x2019;s face off.&quot; There is no turning back once you do something like that. The old face is mangled and useless; you can&#x2019;t put it back on. &quot;I&#x2019;m thinking about it very systematically.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.26">He tells me about going to Paris, having lunch with Pascal Coler, a 30-year-old man who got a new face in 2008. Coler had lived with big tumors all over his face. A terrible life. &quot;And I have a very good steak tartare,&quot; Rodriguez says. &quot;And next to me is Pascal, chowing down the biggest porterhouse. As normal as can be. No one looks at him. He has a job, a potential girlfriend. I&#x2019;m like, holy mackerel, this is huge. We&#x2019;ve gone beyond clinical; now we can change someone&#x2019;s life.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.27">I want to ask Rodriguez how one patient who seemed reasonably content during one meal is enough to quiet an entire internal moral crisis, but he&#x2019;s on fast-forward, the adventure playing out like an action movie.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.28">&quot;Let&#x2019;s go!&quot; he tells me. &quot;It&#x2019;s on!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.29">So in Baltimore, a team of five surgeons are mobilized&#x2014;two to work on the donor, three on Richard&#x2014;and the operating rooms are readied. &quot;I go, &#x2019;Richard, if you want to pull the plug right now, do it,&#x2019; &quot; says Rodriguez. &quot; &#x2019;I don&#x2019;t want you to feel any pressure; there&#x2019;s a lot going on here, and I just need you to tell me right now if you&#x2019;re ready, and if you aren&#x2019;t, we just walk away and it&#x2019;s all good.&#x2019;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2a"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558306963655c24c6c956f28/master/w_806/life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-06.jpg" alt="life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-06.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306963655c24c6c956f28%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-06.jpg&amp;description=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306963655c24c6c956f28%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-06.jpg&amp;description=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2b"> <strong>The World&#x2019;s Most Daring Transplant</strong></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2c"> The surgery, which started with incisions from Richard&#x2019;s scalp to his neck, began at dawn on March 19, 2012, and continued nonstop for the next thirty-six hours.
 Richard&#x2019;s old face was removed to expose his skull, eye sockets, and throat and neck muscles.
 The donor face was applied in one solid piece that included the jaw, tongue, muscles, skin, nose, teeth, and eyelids.
Hammers and saws were used to shape Richard&#x2019;s new jaw. Metal plates stabilized the donor face and allowed doctors to attach it to Richard&#x2019;s skull with screws.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2d">&quot;He said, &#x2019;Let&#x2019;s go. We&#x2019;re doing it.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s it. You get yourself in your mental game. It&#x2019;s fourth and goal, and we are going into the end zone. We&#x2019;re going to win the Super Bowl. This is the moment of no return. Complete silence in the room; like, holy mackerel. Tough moment. No failure. This is it. We&#x2019;re going to make this thing. The face is one unit. I&#x2019;m picking it up. I&#x2019;m laying it on him. I&#x2019;ve got to get everything centered, it can&#x2019;t be off-kilter, the nose has gotta be straight, everything&#x2019;s gotta land perfectly.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2e">&quot;Now, this organ is not receiving blood. It needs to receive blood. The longer it takes to receive blood increases the chance for acute rejection. We gotta get this thing drinking.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2f">&quot;Connecting the artery, then the vein, and then we release, and it really is like a miracle. Impressive. You see the blood just coming from the neck, crossing the lips. Seeing the nose&#x2014;it&#x2019;s white and it turns pink, like normal flesh. It takes seconds. And now we&#x2019;re thinking, Okay, I can take a little breather, but we still have to push ahead, I have to get Richard out of the operating room. We still have to connect the nerves, a lot of nerves. We have to suture the inside of his mouth and tongue; everything has to be sutured. And fix the rest of the bones. Line up the soft tissue. Line up his hairline. Line up his eyebrows. Get the eyelids. So all that needs to happen.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2g">&quot;We&#x2019;re at about eighteen to twenty hours. We&#x2019;ve still got a lot to go. I predicted twenty-four to thirty-six hours. I think the unique thing about this face transplant is that it was so extensive and comprehensive.

You have to wipe it off if you want to see anything. And what choice do you have? You&#x2019;ve already moved forward. You&#x2019;ve given a guy a new face. You&#x2019;ve gotten a new face. Your kid has a new face. There is no turning back.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2j">One day on the foggy mountaintop, Richard and I get bored sitting around his house, so we decide to take a drive. He is a man of hard-earned platitudes. &quot;Sometimes God will put you on your back to make you look up. Sometimes you need that nudge.&quot; He&#x2019;s grateful for his new face. He&#x2019;s grateful to Josh, the donor. Five other people are now living with organs from Josh. &quot;It helps you understand...I&#x2019;m not going to say the afterlife, but what you do here on earth and what you leave here on earth&#x2014;it&#x2019;s totally two different things.&quot; He tells me about his efforts to raise awareness for organ donation; he&#x2019;s become something of a national spokesman for the cause.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2k">In the car, we talk about all the fun things we&#x2019;ll do on our drive. His sister lives about an hour away, in the house Richard grew up in, the house where this whole mess started fifteen years ago, when he shot himself in the face. We haven&#x2019;t talked much about the accident. He doesn&#x2019;t remember anything. Morning or night, nothing. &quot;It&#x2019;s just a cobweb.&quot; He suggests we stop at a beautiful lookout place, too. First, though, he asks me to stop at a store. &quot;Something for my throat,&quot; he says. He comes out of the store carrying a brown bag. We continue our journey, go up into the voluminous mountains rolling every which way you look.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2l">We talk about cracked iPhones. He&#x2019;s going to start a business fixing cracked iPhones. We talk about his girlfriend. &quot;Melanie,&quot; he says, pulling up a picture of her as if to offer proof. &quot;She&#x2019;s real.&quot; He can&#x2019;t wait to meet her in person. We talk about being a lab rat. On this matter he says he&#x2019;s honored. In a way, his whole life has been volunteering. When he was in high school, he was a volunteer firefighter. Now, with his new face, doctors are learning so much about how to treat soldiers suffering ballistic facial injuries. He likes helping people. He likes giving people hope. &quot;A drop of hope can create an ocean,&quot; he says. &quot;But a bucket of faith can create an entire world.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2m">&quot;That&#x2019;s true,&quot; I say.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2n">&quot;My throat,&quot; he says. We&#x2019;re getting higher, and my ears have popped. He&#x2019;s stretched out, relad. He reaches into the brown bag, pulls out a bottle of Wild Turkey.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2o">&quot;For my throat,&quot; he says. He can&#x2019;t take over-the-counter medications, he says. Too risky with his meds. There&#x2019;s a backpack at his feet. He opens it, pulls out some tubing and a wide syringe, about a half-inch across, the kind you use to give medicine to horses.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2p">&quot;I don&#x2019;t like the taste,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2q">He hooks the syringe to the tubing, lifts up his shirt. I think I&#x2019;m supposed to pretend this is not happening. I&#x2019;m driving. There&#x2019;s a port under his shirt, connected to his stomach. I was not aware of that. He hooks the tubing to the port, so now the fat syringe is standing straight up.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2r">He opens the Wild Turkey and starts pouring.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2s">&quot;Richard, I don&#x2019;t think Dr. Rodriguez would want you doing this&#x2014;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2t">All this talk of risk, all the meds, no smoking, no drinking, no falling. A lab rat. Everything measured and quantified and documented.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2u">The Wild Turkey isn&#x2019;t going down. It&#x2019;s clogged. He jiggles the syringe.

There are no cars anywhere. We are deep into the mountain range.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2x">He gets out, flips the syringe, emptying it. He gets back in and examines all the tubing, pinches this and that, allowing some stomach juices to squirt out.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2y">&quot;So that&#x2019;s how you eat?&quot; I ask. &quot;You use the tube?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.2z">&quot;No,&quot; he says. He used to. He doesn&#x2019;t need it anymore.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.30">He reconnects everything, pours again. The whiskey goes quickly inside him, like water down a drain.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.31">He looks at me. &quot;This is how it&#x2019;s supposed to work.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.32">&quot;This is for your <em>throat?</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.33">&quot;I can&#x2019;t take over-the-counter medication,&quot; he says again.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.34">Everything about him is vague. Except this isn&#x2019;t vague. He refills the syringe, lets another round drain into him, and another. I don&#x2019;t know how much. It seems like a lot. I wonder what it will be like to be with a drunk Richard. I imagine his sister, the beautiful lookout place. It doesn&#x2019;t happen. Within five minutes he folds, like a shot animal folds, over himself, folded, eyes open, his body deflated, the tube hanging out, dignity depleted.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.35">&quot;Richard?&quot; I say. &quot;Richard?&quot; I shove his shoulder and nothing happens. He is dead. He is on my watch and he is dead. I hear gurgling. Breathing. He&#x2019;s on my watch and he is not dead.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.36">My watch?</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.37">The breathing is going in his mouth and out his nose. I am studying his face to make sure air is moving. In his mouth. Out his nose. This didn&#x2019;t used to be his mouth or his nose. He can smell with that nose. He can chew food with a dead man&#x2019;s jaw and teeth. There is no denying how fantastic that is.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.38">I don&#x2019;t know where to go. I don&#x2019;t know one foggy mountaintop from another. I can&#x2019;t wake him up.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.39">I have his address in my GPS. I hit &quot;previous destination.&quot; When we get to his house, I drag him out of the car, exactly the way you drag a drunk out of a car, one arm over my shoulder, little steps. I kick the etched bear on the storm door to open it.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3a">&quot;Hello?

Keep in mind, someone had to die for him to receive this face. So there&#x2019;s a certain sense of responsibility and burden that I need to make sure that this is not going to be wasted. This has to be a responsible person that will share the precious gift and take this gift and make something with it, and of it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3d">&quot;A lot of responsibility,&quot; I say.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3e">&quot;A lot,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3f">I ask him if he thinks people can get overly invested in the happily-ever-after in his line of work.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3g">&quot;Of course,&quot; he says. &quot;Of course.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3h">A recent article by Rodriguez in the medical journal <em>The Lancet</em> features before-and-after pictures of Richard. Side by side, the change is stunning, from a man with a mangled swirl of a face to regular guy. The more I look at the picture of Richard&#x2019;s disfigured face, the more I wish I knew it. His eyes are bigger, rounder, provide a wider window. His eyebrows are all mid up, one curved sharply, the other a gentle swoop, thick scars in between. His lower face is cartoonish, like a drawing of an old guy who took his dentures out. There is so much to find in this face, so many avenues of inquiry.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3i">Patient selection, Rodriguez writes in <em>The Lancet,</em> is the key to success when it comes to face transplantation. &quot;Patient selection by a thorough screening process...serves as the best safeguard against ethical challenges,&quot; he writes. &quot;Rigorous preoperative psychiatric and psychological selection of patients deemed to be stable, motivated, and compliant by a multidisciplinary team is a crucial determinant of a safe and rapid recovery.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3j">The article looks back at all twenty-eight face transplants that have occurred and represents Rodriguez&#x2019;s full circle from doubt to certainty. Three people have died from complications. Everyone else is said to be doing great.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3k">NYU hospital issued a press release when the article was published, extolling Rodriguez&#x2019;s call for a &quot;moral imperative&quot; to offer face transplants, the &quot;Mount Everest&quot; of medical-surgical treatments.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3l">And yet while the debate about the ethics of face transplantation has shifted dramatically since the early days of harsh warnings against the procedure, researchers in a recent academic survey of the &quot;successful&quot; transplants note a distinct paucity of data on the psychological outcomes for these patients, who, they point out, often suffer from PTSD, alcohol abuse, and opiate dependence as a result of the trauma leading to their initial disfigurement.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3m">Another journal article, in <em>Anthropology Today,</em> considered the topic under the heading &quot;Ethical slippage and quiet death,&quot; with Richard&#x2019;s picture occupying an entire page.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3n"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3o">I try to tell Richard&#x2019;s mom about the Wild Turkey, but this is a difficult conversation, and I&#x2019;m not sure it&#x2019;s the right thing to do.

She talks about Rodriguez. Everything comes back to Rodriguez: &quot;My godsend.&quot; That&#x2019;s a lot of pressure on a savior. I wonder what exactly happened back in 1997 when Richard shot himself in the face. In an e-book version of the story, Richard says he was blindingly drunk, had come home and become verbally abusive with his mom, who sent him to his room to sleep it off. That part appears to be true, according to a police report filed in the Henry County Sheriff&#x2019;s Office. But the rest of the story&#x2014;that a shotgun happened to be tilted in a gun case and, upon coming out of his room, Richard was asked by his mom to straighten it, causing it to fire accidentally&#x2014;appears to be apocryphal. According to the report: &quot;Mrs. Norris was standing in the doorway of Richard&#x2019;s bedroom; fussing at Richard about him wanting to go out again. Richard took a shotgun from his gun cabinet and told Mrs. Norris that he would just shoot himself. When Richard racked a shell into the shotgun&#x2019;s chamber, the gun fired.... There was what appeared to be human flesh, bone, and teeth on all four walls in Richard&#x2019;s bedroom.&quot; Mrs. Norris told police, &quot;Richard&#x2019;s face exploded.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3t">It would take fifteen years to fix what had gone wrong that night&#x2014;or at least to try to.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.3u">&quot;The really weird thing is, me and Richard&#x2019;s girlfriend found Dr. Rodriguez at the same time,&quot; his mom tells me.

For starters, doctors needed a donor who wasn&#x2019;t just a favorable blood match but also had the proper skeletal features and skin color&#x2014;they calculated only a 14 percent chance they&#x2019;d find one. Then there was the epic surgery that took a team of 150 people. Now Richard just needs to win the daily battle against his body&#x2019;s impulse to reject the face. Here&#x2019;s what that routine entails. &#x2014;Christopher Swetala</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4a"> <strong>The First Days</strong></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4b">To keep his highly sensitive face protected, Richard couldn&#x2019;t so much as shave or brush his teeth. Abrasive contact could have damaged the sutures holding together the incisions, and even a scratch could have caused dangerous swelling and irritation.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4c"> <strong>The First Six Months</strong></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4d">Richard was given large doses of drugs to help suppress his immune system and blunt rejection. But in his weakened state, a simple cold sore could have left him gravely ill, so doctors also gave Richard things like antiviral medication so he could fight off infections we&#x2019;re all commonly exposed to when we do something as innocent as take a sip from a friend&#x2019;s Coke. Those drugs came with risks, too&#x2014;Richard was monitored for signs of diabetes, arthritis, and kidney failure. At times, he was taking some thirty pills each day through a feeding tube to his stomach.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4e"> <strong>The Rest of His Life</strong></p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4f">These days, Richard swallows three pills in the morning and two at night in order to keep his immune system at 50 percent strength&#x2014;just enough to ward off common viral and bacteria infections but not so strong that his own antibodies attack his new face. In addition to avoiding things that tax his body&#x2014;everything from the sun to cigarettes&#x2014;Richard visits his doctors every month.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4g">&quot;This was during the whole stage of my disfigurement when I was working for race teams,&quot; Richard says. &quot;When I was at the racetrack, it was like nobody didn&#x2019;t care. They didn&#x2019;t care what I looked like. Only thing they cared about was how good I could set that race car up.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4h">&quot;You had a job? And a girlfriend? And an apartment? You were living a whole life?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4i">&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4j">So why did he need a new face? Why had he endured the complications involved in freeing him from disfigurement? The thirty-six-hour operation, a 50 percent chance of dying on the table, a life of anti-rejection medications. No sunburn. No falling. Watch out for yellow. Two rejections so far.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4k">&quot;I didn&#x2019;t like the girl,&quot; his mom says. &quot;She tried to cut me out of everything.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4l">There was a fight. At their apartment. Richard was convalescing after a surgery, and his mom came by. &quot;She wouldn&#x2019;t let me in to see Richard,&quot; she says. &quot;So I went through her. And she told me, get out of her house, the doctor said nobody could see Richard. I said, &#x2019;I ain&#x2019;t just nobody, I&#x2019;m his mother. I&#x2019;m gonna see him.&#x2019; I whopped her. And I had her on the floor. I just told her, I said, &#x2019;You don&#x2019;t take my son away from me. Nobody takes my son.&#x2019; And she said, &#x2019;I&#x2019;m gonna call the law.&#x2019; I said, <em>&#x2019;Well, just call the law.&#x2019;</em> &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4m">&quot;I got rid of her,&quot; Richard says.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4n">&quot;Then we moved up here in 2005, away from everybody,&quot; his mom says.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4o">Which is right about the time they found Rodriguez.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4p">&quot;We don&#x2019;t like it here,&quot; his mom says.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4q">&quot;It&#x2019;s the most boringest place on earth,&quot; Richard says.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4r">Being famous is better. One of Japan&#x2019;s top fifty miracles. And he was willing to go through with getting a new face. And there was all that salvation his mom needed. And the wounded warriors needed him. And humanity needed him. And having a new face is better than some old disfigured one. You can&#x2019;t argue with that.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4s"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4t">Richard wishes Rodriguez had stayed in Baltimore.

And yes, the incident in the car? &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; he says. There&#x2019;s a certain amount of self-medication, he says. &quot;But that&#x2019;s just self-medication.&quot; We&#x2019;re at NYU again, and he&#x2019;s not exactly sure what today&#x2019;s event is. Some kind of fund-raiser, he thinks. We&#x2019;re in the waiting room. He looks great in his suit. &quot;I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;ll be very nice people,&quot; he says. He likes people. He likes visiting patients. People come to talk to Rodriguez, or the team back in Baltimore, and Richard joins them. They want face transplants. They want to know what it&#x2019;s like. He tells them what it&#x2019;s like. He knows exactly how they feel. It&#x2019;s something positive he can do with his life. A face. &quot;This is what I am,&quot; he tells me. &quot;There is nothing more important than a face.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4u">He brings up Hallam, the guy with the hand. &quot;He couldn&#x2019;t take it, so he had to cut it off,&quot; he says. &quot;So now they say, &#x2019;Is the face transplant going to have that identity crisis, too?&#x2019; Well, if he does, <em>we&#x2019;re screwed.</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4v">A woman with curly dark hair peeks into the waiting room. &quot;We&#x2019;re ready!&quot; she says. We head down the hall. Richard takes two steps into the conference room, and the people burst into spontaneous applause.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4w">&quot;Hi, Richard!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4x">&quot;Hello, Richard!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4y">Rodriguez sits at the head of the table. Pretty little cookies are laid out. &quot;This institute was made possible by these incredible people,&quot; he says to Richard.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.4z">&quot;It&#x2019;s our pleasure, Richard.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.50">&quot;God bless you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.51">&quot;You&#x2019;re very brave.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.52">&quot;You&#x2019;re a real ambassador.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.53">Richard thanks them on behalf of all the people in the future who might be helped. &quot;A drop of hope can create an entire ocean,&quot; he says. &quot;A little speck of faith can create a world. You give that speck of faith to them.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.54">&quot;He never really thought about himself in all of this,&quot; Rodriguez says. &quot;He&#x2019;s always thought about helping the wounded warriors and the other people, and providing hope. He&#x2019;s a remarkable man.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.55">&quot;And they can do research on me as well,&quot; Richard says.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.56">And that about wraps it up?</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.57">A woman has a question. She has wide shoulders, blond hair.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.58">&quot;What about your family?&quot; she says. &quot;Do they have therapeutic resources available to them to support you?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.59">&quot;Actually, the support I get mainly is from therapists,&quot; Richard says. &quot;They send me home with homework, give me ercises to practice, to help with my speech, my swallowing, you know. Physical therapy helps a whole lot, played a huge role in my recovery.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5a">The woman tries again.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5b">&quot;Emotionally, did you feel you got the support you needed?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5c">&quot;Emotionally I can get lab work done no matter where I am, if I&#x2019;m home, if I&#x2019;m in Baltimore. If I&#x2019;m here, I get it done here. That way the lab work is always current.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5d">I want to jump in here. I want to tell the woman with the questions about Wild Turkey, the poverty line, lab rats and wiener dogs, illness and violence.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5e">Rodriguez jumps in. &quot;The answer is yes and no,&quot; he says. &quot;This is a new field. Every transplant has to be well thought out. One thing that you can appreciate with Richard is there was not a step missed in this rehearsal and this practice. And now Richard is our ambassador, and he can help us.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5f">&quot;You are one of the greatest people I&#x2019;ve ever met,&quot; one in the crowd says to Richard.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5g">&quot;Terrific. So handsome.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5h">&quot;Thank you,&quot; Richard says, reaching for Rodriguez. &quot;It comes from his hands. His hands.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5i"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5j">Richard calls me shortly before he heads to New Orleans to meet Melanie, the new girlfriend. I wish him well. I feel nervous for him, want her to be real. For all his guile, he&#x2019;s a trusting soul. And he needs a girlfriend or some companion to assist him through life. If there&#x2019;s a future for him, it is almost assuredly off the foggy mountaintop. But under whose watch? Who will drive him around? He&#x2019;s a science experiment. He&#x2019;s a lab rat. He&#x2019;s not a normal sort of boyfriend.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5k"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558306963655c24c6c956f2a/master/w_806/life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-07.jpg" alt="life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-07.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;t=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306963655c24c6c956f2a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-07.jpg&amp;description=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frichard-norris&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558306963655c24c6c956f2a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-07.jpg&amp;description=life-2014-08-richard-norris-richard-norris-gq-magazine-august-2014-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Courtesy of Richard Norris</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5l">One day Melanie appears on my Skype screen. She&#x2019;s real. She&#x2019;s lovely. Richard is sitting next to her, waving to me. He wipes constant drool with the help of a towel. She just came home from work and put a pot roast in the oven. Richard folded the laundry. She wants to care for him. She finds a well of kindness in him. She&#x2019;s been burned so many times. She says nothing about his medical-rock-star status, nothing about the drool. &quot;Why does anyone fall in love?&quot; she says with a shrug, when I ask about the relationship. She&#x2019;s the first person I meet who talks about Richard as just a regular person. He&#x2019;s not: a miracle. He&#x2019;s not: a medical circus act. He&#x2019;s not: an ambassador of anything. He&#x2019;s a guy with barely a tick of a functioning immune system, thanks to the inexorable march forward of technology and a worldwide race for surgical glory. But for now, at least, she doesn&#x2019;t need to have that conversation. I get the sense she would have liked Richard with his old face just the same.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5m">In short order she introduces Richard to her kids, her mom; everybody likes everybody. She meets Richard&#x2019;s mom by phone, and so far so good. One day she notices maybe a rash? &quot;What is that?&quot; she asks Richard. &quot;I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s anything,&quot; he says. He doesn&#x2019;t want it to be anything. He&#x2019;s finally with her, and he wants to stay. &quot;I&#x2019;m worried,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#x2019;s getting worse.&quot; She takes a picture of the rash, insists that Richard send it to the doctors in Baltimore keeping track of his medical care.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5n">&quot;Get here,&quot; they say. &quot;Next plane out.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5o">If it&#x2019;s acute rejection and they can&#x2019;t reverse it, he dies.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5p">He&#x2019;s hospitalized for two weeks, pumped full of stuff to get the rejection under control, then sent back to the foggy mountaintop to recover.</p><p data-reactid=".l6lmioyrk0.1.1.0.0.4.5q">&quot;Come back,&quot; Melanie tells him. &quot;Please come back.
