  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A In the beginning, there was the tube. The cathode-ray tube, that is, and \u0022The Tube,\u0022 that squat shiny box that ate up half the living room and all of your family\u0027s attention. Then came cable, and videocassettes, HBO, DVDs, and the Sony PlayStation and TiVo, satellite and Blu-ray, and the ninety-six-inch flat-screen and a slew of awkward little bos with those mysterious colored lights, all of which changed the way we entertain ourselves. But most important, there came the Internet and Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos and Reed Hastings, who blew up all the old paradigms about who, what, when, where, why, and even how we watch, busting the chains that bind us to our cable bos, to the never-ending scroll of 739 channels, to our prime-time prison.\u000A\u000A Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, has a name for this prison and what it does to the people trapped inside it: managed dissatisfaction. \u0022The traditional entertainment ecosystem is built on it, and it\u0027s a totally artificial concept,\u0022 says Hastings. \u0022The point of managed dissatisfaction is waiting. You\u0027re supposed to wait for your show that comes on Wednesday at 8 p.m., wait for the new season, see all the ads everywhere for the new season, talk to your friends at the office about how excited you are.\u0022 If it\u0027s a movie, he adds, you wait till the night it opens, you wait for the pay-channel window, you wait for it to come to cable. Waiting means pent-up demand, millions of people watching the same thing at the same time, preferably at night, when they\u0027re pliant with exhaustion and ready to believe they need the stuff being hawked in all those commercials. Waiting, Hastings says, is dead.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Arrested Development is back!\u000A\u000A Hastings is a rangy, goateed 52-year-old with a master\u0027s in computer science from Stanford who left the Marine Corps officers\u0027 training program to teach in the Peace Corps in Swaziland. It\u0027s a mild California morning in November, and he\u0027s sitting at a weathered teak table outside the modest house he shares with his wife and two teenage kids in hippie-inflected Santa Cruz, thirty minutes from Netflix headquarters in upscale Los Gatos. Barely 1,800 square feet and furnished with puffy couches and few personal touches beyond some family pictures on the mantel and four sleeping dogs his wife rescued from the shelter, it looks like the sort of pad a newly hired midlevel software ecutive might rent while he was looking for something to buy. Hastings\u0027s only domestic indulgence is a $5,000 handmade Italian espresso machine—\u0022the closest I\u0027m going to get to a Bentley,\u0022 he jokes—in the cozy Sub-Zero-less kitchen.\u000A\u000A But just because Hastings doesn\u0027t care about boats and cars doesn\u0027t mean he isn\u0027t relentlessly ambitious. After all, the guy is betting everything on a breathtakingly expensive plan to transform his once humble DVD-by-mail company into a worldwide on-demand behemoth and a major force in original programming, a supercharged HBO. Within the next decade, probably the next five years, he figures, ours will be a seamless, multidevice on-demand world, a place where services like Netflix will be so fat with content that the idea of paying a $150 monthly cable bill for a bundle of unwatchable crap will seem as quaint as gathering around the Sony Trinitron with Ma and Pa on Tuesday at 8 p.m. for All in the Family.\u000A\u000A  \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Is It Time to Cut the Cable Cord? (click to enlarge) On February 1, all of Hollywood will be watching the debut of House of Cards, David Fincher\u0027s drama starring Kevin Spacey, for which Netflix outmaneuvered HBO. (Fincher, the director of Fight Club and The Social Network, has never before done television; Hastings gave him $100 million and let him make two thirteen-episode seasons.) Subscribers will be able to stream the entire first season of the pitch-black Beltway thriller—imagine the anti&amp;#x2013;West Wing—in a single sitting. Within months of that debut, two other series, Orange Is the New Black (by Weeds creator Jenji Kohan, from a memoir about a Smith girl in a women\u0027s prison) and Hemlock Grove, an adaptation of the supernaturally tinged novel, will also stream exclusively on Netflix. And in the spring, Netflix will debut the long-awaited season four of Arrested Development, the beloved series that Fox canceled seven years ago. (Also on the tarmac: Derek, Ricky Gervais\u0027s much maligned show about a dim-witted eccentric who works in a nursing home, and season two of Lilyhammer, Netflix\u0027s first attempt at an original series, which debuted last February and stars Steven Van Zandt as a mobster taking shelter in a small Norwegian town.)\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Netflix\u0027s first original series, Lilyhammer.\u000A\u000A The strategy may gut some media conglomerates along the way and could prove too costly for even a cash-rich company like Netflix to sustain, but one thing is certain: It will make a lot of viewers—bingeing on brand-new shows made by the hottest writers, directors, and producers—deliriously happy. \u0022This is the direction that storytelling is evolving, where you\u0027re going to have the most interesting story lines, the most interesting characters,\u0022 says Spacey, who is also an ecutive producer of House of Cards. \u0022What a company like Netflix is doing is the ultimate expression of individual control, proof of what people\u0027s attention span really is.\u0022\u000A\u000A The heady rhetoric, of course, masks a few nagging questions: Once waiting is history, will \u0022quality\u0022 television still pack the same cultural punch? Would Tony Soprano be Tony Soprano if we had been able to gorge on his life in a single weekend? How important are episode recaps and live-tweeting and the shared experience of everyone watching together?\u000A\u000A \u0022I don\u0027t know,\u0022 says Spacey. \u0022But I guess we\u0027ll find out really soon.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A \u0022in a creative business like this, you have to take risks, and sometimes you\u0027re wrong,\u0022 Hastings says. \u0022You have to move on. I work a lot on that.\u0022\u000A\u000A Hastings will graciously debate the merits of consuming entertainment the old-fashioned way, but you get the idea that he\u0027s just humoring you. He is convinced that once we give up the artificiality of managed dissatisfaction, we will never miss it. He held this truth to be self-evident fifteen years ago, even as he and Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph (who left in 2002) were experimenting with the best way to mail DVDs. Hastings was keeping an eye on streaming video in its infancy, and he knew then that streaming was going to kill his own DVD business and, ultimately, broadcast and cable if they stuck to their guns. He knew that people were going to want to watch what they wanted, when they wanted it, and that no amount of network or studio hand-wringing would prop up the wall. Back then, before he decided to invest in original programming, he figured that the best way to keep customers was to personalize the experience using algorithms that churned their viewing histories. In the DVD era, this meant a tepid list of \u0022You Might Like\u0022 next to your queue; now it involves a bespoke Netflix interface, an illustrated version of your entertainment psyche in all its vainglory: Black-and-White Thrillers, Action Movies with Martial Arts, Documentaries about Pot.\u000A\u000A \u0022Back when we were just mailing DVDs, we were thinking, Can we be ready for the transformation to streaming?\u0022 he says, balancing on his saucer an egg he\u0027s just plucked from the coop in his backyard, where five chickens peck around with a couple of Nigerian dwarf goats. \u0022Can we know our subscribers well enough to show them what they want?\u0022\u000A\u000A By plenty of measures, he\u0027s half-scaled the mountain. Netflix now has about 30 million streaming subscribers worldwide, more than 25 million in the United States, in addition to about 8 million people—admittedly dwindling daily—who still pay to get DVDs in the mail. At $7.99 a month, that\u0027s about $3.6 billion a year rolling in. Nearly a third of all U.S. Internet streaming traffic in the evening comes through Netflix. (YouTube accounts for 13 percent, Facebook less than 2 percent.) And Netflix is in the midst of an international expansion covering fifty countries, including Scandinavia and the U.K., where in thirteen months it has gained more than half as many subscribers as LoveFilm, its long-established Amazon&amp;#x2013;owned rival.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A \u0022Fincher is very interested in exploring just how deep the dark well goes, and so am I,\u0022 Spacey says of House of Cards.\u000A\u000A That\u0027s all the more remarkable when you consider that it\u0027s been little more than a year since Hastings made the near-fatal mistake that still haunts him—announcing in rapid succession a major price increase and the news that Netflix would split off its DVD business into a separate company called Qwikster. He thought he was just formalizing a shift that had already happened for his customers, but he badly underestimated their emotional tie to the little red envelope. He quickly retreated, posting a mea culpa video that wound up as fodder for an SNL parody that got cut from the show but went viral online. (\u0022Qwikster is split into three new websites: Qwikster, Kwickster, and Qwickster.\u0022) Though he killed Qwikster before it even launched, about 800,000 Netflix subscribers canceled in just a few months, sending the stock from an admittedly inflated $300 a share to $77. (At press time, it was trading at about $95.) Comparisons to the New Coke fiasco abounded.\u000A\u000A But it wasn\u0027t just bad messaging that ended the honeymoon between Netflix and Wall Street. No, for all his vision and adaptability, Hastings is currently in the vice grip of so many competitive forces that it\u0027s a marvel he can maintain his Zen calm. Giants from Amazon to Apple TV to Hulu are throwing money at their own streaming services, driving the cost of licensing exclusive content into the ozone. Amazon and iTunes charge per episode or movie, which means they\u0027re able to stream newer stuff. (Subscribers to Amazon\u0027s $79-a-year Prime shipping service get free access to a growing selection of content.) Meanwhile, Netflix hasn\u0027t been able to add subscribers at the swift pace it promised shareholders lately, a trend that could make it much harder to establish the \u0022virtuous cycle\u0022 it\u0027s chasing—that is, subscription fees enabling Netflix to acquire content that in turn attracts new subscribers, which will pay for more content. Profit margins, which are nearly 50 percent on the declining DVD side of the business, are only about 17 percent on the streaming side of the ledger. Smelling blood in the water, Carl Icahn, the notoriously intrusive takeover shark, snatched up 10 percent of Netflix\u0027s stock in October, probably hoping to force a sale to a deep-pocketed giant like Google or Facebook.\u000A\u000A \u0022I really don\u0027t see how they can stay afloat alone,\u0022 says a top TV ecutive (and yes, one of Hastings\u0027s key competitors), adding that the kind of high-quality original television Netflix plans to make is \u0022an incredibly expensive game to be in.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A From the creator of Weeds, a ladies-in-prison show. \u000A\u000A Like any CEO of a publicly owned company, Hastings doesn\u0027t rule out a sale someday. Just not today. Or tomorrow. And not on Icahn\u0027s timetable or at $95 a share. He believes that investing deeply in original content and driving deals like the one he made with Disney in December (exclusive streaming of all Disney films during the premium-cable window starting in 2016) will enable Netflix to grow to 90 million subscribers in the United States alone. That would be a hell of a trick, considering that at the moment there are only about 81 million homes with broadband. But he seems certain that Netflix will survive in entertainment\u0027s New Order, along with ESPN and HBO once those mighty brands figure out a graceful way to transition to stand-alone streaming. Those other guys? All those marginal channels that depend on being packaged in a basic-cable bundle, not to mention the cable companies themselves? He\u0027s not so sure.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A \u0022What if you could radically alter the way stories get told?\u0022 asks Ted Sarandos. \u0022What if the way people wanted to consume content actually changed what you could make?\u0022 Rhetorical questions, perhaps, but the kind of things Netflix\u0027s chief content officer, its point man in Hollywood, likes to ponder when he has a down moment.\u000A\u000A Which is hardly ever. These days, he is the man everyone wants to take a meeting with. People love you when you\u0027re handing out the cash, and Sarandos, who looks the part with pressed jeans and a crisp white shirt but has one of the weirdest résumés in town (graduate of an Arizona community college, worked his way up in the DVD business from video-store clerk, landed at Netflix in 2000 to run distribution), has $6 billion to dole out over the next three years. Most of that is for licensing content from networks, cable companies, and movie studios, but about $300 million is for original programming. \u0022There\u0027s not a lot of really great, deep, serialized television,\u0022 he says, \u0022and we can see from the data that that\u0027s what people want.\u0022\u000A\u000A He hopes to make at least five new shows a year, he says, leaning back on a sofa in his Beverly Hills office in an anonymous-looking suite. His dream project: a Netflix series created by Warren Beatty. \u0022He\u0027s great in long form,\u0022 Sarandos says. \u0022His only problems have been when he\u0027s constrained.\u0022 Sarandos is also warming up Jodie Foster, who directed an episode of Orange Is the New Black. \u0022The goal,\u0022 he says, \u0022is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\u0022 His seductive pitch to today\u0027s new breed of TV auteurs: a huge audience, real money, no meddlesome ecutives (\u0022I\u0027m not going to give David Fincher notes\u0022), no pilots (television\u0027s great sucking hole of money and hope), and a full-season commitment.\u000A\u000A \u0022The idea that they wouldn\u0027t just pull the plug midway was totally thrilling,\u0022 says Kohan, who spent years in the network trenches before making Weeds for Showtime. To her, \u0022It\u0027s similar to a pay-cable model but even more liberating. This is the future.\u0022\u000A\u000A Sarandos is hoping his big tent will attract creators who want to explore the boundaries of storytelling. Binge viewing obviates the need for recaps and other clunky narrative devices. He isn\u0027t even wed to uniform episode lengths. What\u0027s so magical about twenty-two minutes or even a hour? \u0022I really think we have the chance to radically change the depth of character connectivity,\u0022 he says. \u0022I mean, a meaningful shift. It\u0027s going to further blur the line between television and movies.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Hastings is staying at the Parker Meridien, a sleek midtown-Manhattan hotel, but he shuns the power-breakfast spot in the lobby, which is studded with young media types from nearby News Corp. and Time Warner in their slim-cut suits. Instead, in a gray button-down and pair of brown khakis, he sips a coffee at the local Pain Quotidien. He\u0027s in town for a board meeting of the charter-school network into which he pours millions. Education reform is where he concentrates his philanthropic efforts—he even served on the California State Board of Education when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor. He could probably dominate the board of his alma mater, Bowdoin, the small liberal-arts college in Maine, probably have a building named after him by now, but that just seems, well, pointless. He\u0027d rather disrupt a large system bound by archaic traditions and shoddy technology. Or rather, a second one.\u000A\u000A \u0022You have to focus on one thing where you\u0027re clear on what kind of impact you want to have,\u0022 he says. \u0022Otherwise you never get anything done.\u0022\u000A\u000A Back in his hotel room, he\u0027s assembling the material for a December retreat in the Arizona desert with his top lieutenants. Amid strategy sessions on topics like the new \u0022meta-filters,\u0022 the Kayak-like websites that could erode Netflix loyalty by letting consumers compare which services have the shows they want at the best prices, there will be Hobbes on nature, Jefferson on government, Yeats on the good life. And there\u0027s sure to be something in the program about resilience; Hastings still wrestles with guilt over mistakes he\u0027s made, especially the Qwikster debacle. \u0022You have to learn not to self-flagellate endlessly, to forgive yourself, but it\u0027s hard. In a creative business like this, you have to take risks, and sometimes you\u0027re wrong. You have to move on. I work a lot on that.\u0022\u000A\u000A These days Netflix is legendary in Silicon Valley for its so-called Culture Deck, the company\u0027s constitution. Nearly 3 million people have viewed it—it\u0027s accessible on the Internet—and it\u0027s a brilliant recruiting tool. Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, where Hastings holds a board seat, says it\u0027s the reason Facebook\u0027s directors pursued him. \u0022It may well be the most important document ever to come out of the Valley,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000A The highlights: no limit on vacation days at Netflix, ditto for sick days. No one tells you when to come and go or clocks you when you do. Doing B-level work despite A-level effort will get you a severance package. (Annual attrition is a chilling 20 percent.) A-level work with minimal effort? More money and responsibility. Hastings tells me he has no idea how much vacation his people take on average, and he insists he doesn\u0027t care. Sure, there are times when people stay late, and there\u0027s plenty of e-mailing from home, but a typical day ends at six. (Hastings has no office on the company\u0027s five-building campus; he just floats around with his iPhone, checking in on people, pulling someone into a vacant conference room for a face-to-face.) \u0022You don\u0027t have to give up your life to do your job incredibly well,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A Which isn\u0027t to say that Netflix is a laid-back place to work. Every employee, and most of all Hastings, is obsessively conscious of the mortal challenges the company faces—but that doesn\u0027t stop him from sometimes making light of them. In late 2010, after Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes publicly dismissed Netflix as no more of a threat than the Albanian army, Hastings had Albanian army berets made for senior staff.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Will Arnett, who reprised his role as Gob Bluth for the new season of Arrested Development, gazes out from the curtained-off VIP area as the soldiers of the Netflix army stream into the back lot of Fox Studios in Century City. Nearly 1,000 strong, with geek flags flying, they wear plaid short-sleeve shirts over surf tees and tiny backpacks bulging with devices and chargers. They gawk at the taco truck parked under the giant mural of Tom Ewell fondling Marilyn in The Seven Year Itch, scoop chocolate-covered bananas from the portable freezer, queue up at the open bar, and gleefully scamper to the top of the Bluth \u0022stair car,\u0022 iconic to Arrested Development groupies, for a photo op.\u000A\u000A Not the usual wrap party, that\u0027s for sure, with grips and gaffers downing beers before their long rides home to Cerritos. Arnett still can\u0027t quite believe that the series has been resurrected, or that Hastings has flown in the company\u0027s entire staff—a huge percentage of whom embody the show\u0027s core fan base—from Silicon Valley to celebrate.\u000A\u000A \u0022These are our people,\u0022 Arnett says, before slipping behind the curtain with co-stars Portia de Rossi, Michael Cera, and David Cross. It\u0027s hard to tell if that\u0027s pride in his voice or horror.\u000A\u000A Hastings ambles onto the lot with the crowd, nary an assistant—he doesn\u0027t have one—to clear his path. They say you can tell a lot about a company by how the troops act when the boss is around at a \u0022casual\u0022 event—the desperate tactics to score one-on-one suck-up time, the pathetic way they work to catch his eye. But when a bed-headed programmer in a Banana Splits tee accidentally jostles Hastings, the guy barely glances up from his iPad to say \u0022Oops—sorry, man,\u0022 before moving on.\u000A\u000A Without stopping for a drink, Hastings beelines for Peter Levinsohn, Fox\u0027s head of digital distribution. The production arm of Fox financed the original Arrested Development, which ran on the network but died of weak ratings despite its cult status. This time, Levinsohn made the deal with Netflix to produce another season for the site to stream.\u000A\u000A \u0022Peter\u0027s been a really great partner,\u0022 says Hastings, flashing a gentle smile.\u000A\u000A This is where Levinsohn is supposed to chime in with: \u0022And Netflix has been a great partner, too! Isn\u0027t it wonderful that fans will be able to see another season of this wonderful show?\u0022\u000A\u000A But Levinsohn misses his cue. \u0022Well, overall it\u0027s been a good relationship.\u0022 Hastings stiffens for a beat, then summons back the happy face. He spends a lot of time these days trying not to scare the cable companies and the networks so badly that they\u0027ll gang up on him, downplaying the idea that Netflix could eventually supplant outlets like Fox and NBC. But his happy face isn\u0027t working its magic right now. \u0022I\u0027d be lying if I said I wouldn\u0027t prefer if it were more, um, network-centric,\u0022 says Levinsohn. \u0022Do you know what I mean?\u0022\u000A\u000A Hastings chuckles unconvincingly. Of course he knows. He knows that not even a guy like Levinsohn, who\u0027s gamely experimenting with the industry\u0027s new reality, can deny that he\u0027d much prefer a prime-time slot on a major network. They both know it\u0027s only a matter of time, and not much of it, before companies like Netflix and its phalanx of young and restless programmers and subscribers throw Hollywood off schedule permanently.\u000A\u000A \u0022Isn\u0027t this great?\u0022 Hastings says, gently guiding Levinsohn past a replica red carpet where giddy engineers pose in front of a wall plastered with the Netflix logo. Instantly their photos are projected on a huge screen above the crowd.\u000A\u000A \u0022Great,\u0022 says Levinsohn, his voice as flat as a manhole cover. He doesn\u0027t look up. \u0022Absolutely fantastic.\u0022\u000A\u000A Nancy Hass wrote about Terrell Owens in the February 2012 issue.",

The cathode-ray tube, that is, and &quot;The Tube,&quot; that squat shiny box that ate up half the living room and all of your family&#x2019;s attention. Then came cable, and videocassettes, HBO, DVDs, and the Sony PlayStation and TiVo, satellite and Blu-ray, and the ninety-six-inch flat-screen and a slew of awkward little bos with those mysterious colored lights, all of which changed the way we entertain ourselves. But most important, there came the Internet and Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos and Reed Hastings, who blew up all the old paradigms about who, what, when, where, why, and even how we watch, busting the chains that bind us to our cable bos, to the never-ending scroll of 739 channels, to our prime-time prison.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.2"> Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, has a name for this prison and what it does to the people trapped inside it: managed dissatisfaction. &quot;The traditional entertainment ecosystem is built on it, and it&#x2019;s a totally artificial concept,&quot; says Hastings. &quot;The point of managed dissatisfaction is waiting. You&#x2019;re supposed to wait for your show that comes on Wednesday at 8 p.m., wait for the new season, see all the ads everywhere for the new season, talk to your friends at the office about how excited you are.&quot; If it&#x2019;s a movie, he adds, you wait till the night it opens, you wait for the pay-channel window, you wait for it to come to cable. Waiting means pent-up demand, millions of people watching the same thing at the same time, preferably at night, when they&#x2019;re pliant with exhaustion and ready to believe they need the stuff being hawked in all those commercials. Waiting, Hastings says, is dead.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.3"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d3383655c24c6c94a245/master/w_806/entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-arrested-development.jpg" alt="entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-arrested-development.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;t=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-arrested-development.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;t=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-arrested-development.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d3383655c24c6c94a245%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-arrested-development.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-arrested-development.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d3383655c24c6c94a245%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-arrested-development.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-arrested-development.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <em>Arrested Development</em> is back!</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.6"> Hastings is a rangy, goateed 52-year-old with a master&#x2019;s in computer science from Stanford who left the Marine Corps officers&#x2019; training program to teach in the Peace Corps in Swaziland. It&#x2019;s a mild California morning in November, and he&#x2019;s sitting at a weathered teak table outside the modest house he shares with his wife and two teenage kids in hippie-inflected Santa Cruz, thirty minutes from Netflix headquarters in upscale Los Gatos. Barely 1,800 square feet and furnished with puffy couches and few personal touches beyond some family pictures on the mantel and four sleeping dogs his wife rescued from the shelter, it looks like the sort of pad a newly hired midlevel software ecutive might rent while he was looking for something to buy. Hastings&#x2019;s only domestic indulgence is a $5,000 handmade Italian espresso machine&#x2014;&quot;the closest I&#x2019;m going to get to a Bentley,&quot; he jokes&#x2014;in the cozy Sub-Zero-less kitchen.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.7"> But just because Hastings doesn&#x2019;t care about boats and cars doesn&#x2019;t mean he isn&#x2019;t relentlessly ambitious. After all, the guy is betting everything on a breathtakingly expensive plan to transform his once humble DVD-by-mail company into a worldwide on-demand behemoth and a major force in original programming, a supercharged HBO. Within the next decade, probably the next five years, he figures, ours will be a seamless, multidevice on-demand world, a place where services like Netflix will be so fat with content that the idea of paying a $150 monthly cable bill for a bundle of unwatchable crap will seem as quaint as gathering around the Sony Trinitron with Ma and Pa on Tuesday at 8 p.m. for <em>All in the Family</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.8"> <a href="http://www.gq.com/images/entertainment/2013/02/next-hbo-netflix/gq-intelligence-infographic-big.jpg"> </a></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.9"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d3383655c24c6c94a248/master/w_806/entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-infographic.jpg" alt="entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-infographic.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;t=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-infographic.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;t=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-infographic.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d3383655c24c6c94a248%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-infographic.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-infographic.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d3383655c24c6c94a248%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-infographic.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-infographic.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.a"> <strong>Is It Time to Cut the Cable Cord?</strong> <em>(click to enlarge)</em> On February 1, all of Hollywood will be watching the debut of <em>House of Cards</em>, David Fincher&#x2019;s drama starring Kevin Spacey, for which Netflix outmaneuvered HBO. (Fincher, the director of <em>Fight Club</em> and <em>The Social Network</em>, has never before done television; Hastings gave him $100 million and let him make two thirteen-episode seasons.) Subscribers will be able to stream the entire first season of the pitch-black Beltway thriller&#x2014;imagine the anti&amp;#x2013;<em>West Wing</em>&#x2014;in a single sitting. Within months of that debut, two other series, <em>Orange Is the New Black</em> (by <em>Weeds</em> creator Jenji Kohan, from a memoir about a Smith girl in a women&#x2019;s prison) and <em>Hemlock Grove</em>, an adaptation of the supernaturally tinged novel, will also stream exclusively on Netflix. And in the spring, Netflix will debut the long-awaited season four of <em>Arrested Development</em>, the beloved series that Fox canceled seven years ago. (Also on the tarmac: <em>Derek</em>, Ricky Gervais&#x2019;s much maligned show about a dim-witted eccentric who works in a nursing home, and season two of <em>Lilyhammer</em>, Netflix&#x2019;s first attempt at an original series, which debuted last February and stars Steven Van Zandt as a mobster taking shelter in a small Norwegian town.)</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.b"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d3383655c24c6c94a253/master/w_806/entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-lilyhammer.jpg" alt="entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-lilyhammer.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;t=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-lilyhammer.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;t=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-lilyhammer.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d3383655c24c6c94a253%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-lilyhammer.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-lilyhammer.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d3383655c24c6c94a253%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-lilyhammer.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-lilyhammer.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Netflix&#x2019;s first original series, <em>Lilyhammer</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.d"> The strategy may gut some media conglomerates along the way and could prove too costly for even a cash-rich company like Netflix to sustain, but one thing is certain: It will make a lot of viewers&#x2014;bingeing on brand-new shows made by the hottest writers, directors, and producers&#x2014;deliriously happy. &quot;This is the direction that storytelling is evolving, where you&#x2019;re going to have the most interesting story lines, the most interesting characters,&quot; says Spacey, who is also an ecutive producer of <em>House of Cards</em>. &quot;What a company like Netflix is doing is the ultimate expression of individual control, proof of what people&#x2019;s attention span really is.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.e"> The heady rhetoric, of course, masks a few nagging questions: Once waiting is history, will &quot;quality&quot; television still pack the same cultural punch?

I work a lot on that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.j"> Hastings will graciously debate the merits of consuming entertainment the old-fashioned way, but you get the idea that he&#x2019;s just humoring you. He is convinced that once we give up the artificiality of managed dissatisfaction, we will never miss it. He held this truth to be self-evident fifteen years ago, even as he and Netflix co-founder Marc Randolph (who left in 2002) were experimenting with the best way to mail DVDs. Hastings was keeping an eye on streaming video in its infancy, and he knew then that streaming was going to kill his own DVD business and, ultimately, broadcast and cable if they stuck to their guns. He knew that people were going to want to watch what they wanted, when they wanted it, and that no amount of network or studio hand-wringing would prop up the wall. Back then, before he decided to invest in original programming, he figured that the best way to keep customers was to personalize the experience using algorithms that churned their viewing histories. In the DVD era, this meant a tepid list of &quot;You Might Like&quot; next to your queue; now it involves a bespoke Netflix interface, an illustrated version of your entertainment psyche in all its vainglory: Black-and-White Thrillers, Action Movies with Martial Arts, Documentaries about Pot.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.k"> &quot;Back when we were just mailing DVDs, we were thinking, Can we be ready for the transformation to streaming?&quot; he says, balancing on his saucer an egg he&#x2019;s just plucked from the coop in his backyard, where five chickens peck around with a couple of Nigerian dwarf goats. &quot;Can we know our subscribers well enough to show them what they want?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.l"> By plenty of measures, he&#x2019;s half-scaled the mountain. Netflix now has about 30 million streaming subscribers worldwide, more than 25 million in the United States, in addition to about 8 million people&#x2014;admittedly dwindling daily&#x2014;who still pay to get DVDs in the mail. At $7.99 a month, that&#x2019;s about $3.6 billion a year rolling in. Nearly a third of all U.S. Internet streaming traffic in the evening comes through Netflix. (YouTube accounts for 13 percent, Facebook less than 2 percent.) And Netflix is in the midst of an international expansion covering fifty countries, including Scandinavia and the U.K., where in thirteen months it has gained more than half as many subscribers as LoveFilm, its long-established Amazon&amp;#x2013;owned rival.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.m"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d3383655c24c6c94a25a/master/w_806/entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-fincher-house-of-cards.jpg" alt="entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-fincher-house-of-cards.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;t=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-fincher-house-of-cards.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;t=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-fincher-house-of-cards.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d3383655c24c6c94a25a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-fincher-house-of-cards.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-fincher-house-of-cards.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d3383655c24c6c94a25a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-fincher-house-of-cards.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-fincher-house-of-cards.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.n"> &quot;Fincher is very interested in exploring just how deep the dark well goes, and so am I,&quot; Spacey says of <em>House of Cards</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.o"> That&#x2019;s all the more remarkable when you consider that it&#x2019;s been little more than a year since Hastings made the near-fatal mistake that still haunts him&#x2014;announcing in rapid succession a major price increase and the news that Netflix would split off its DVD business into a separate company called Qwikster. He thought he was just formalizing a shift that had already happened for his customers, but he badly underestimated their emotional tie to the little red envelope. He quickly retreated, posting a mea culpa video that wound up as fodder for an <em>SNL</em> parody that got cut from the show but went viral online. (&quot;Qwikster is split into three new websites: Qwikster, Kwickster, and Qwickster.&quot;) Though he killed Qwikster before it even launched, about 800,000 Netflix subscribers canceled in just a few months, sending the stock from an admittedly inflated $300 a share to $77. (At press time, it was trading at about $95.) Comparisons to the New Coke fiasco abounded.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.p"> But it wasn&#x2019;t just bad messaging that ended the honeymoon between Netflix and Wall Street. No, for all his vision and adaptability, Hastings is currently in the vice grip of so many competitive forces that it&#x2019;s a marvel he can maintain his Zen calm. Giants from Amazon to Apple TV to Hulu are throwing money at their own streaming services, driving the cost of licensing exclusive content into the ozone. Amazon and iTunes charge per episode or movie, which means they&#x2019;re able to stream newer stuff. (Subscribers to Amazon&#x2019;s $79-a-year Prime shipping service get free access to a growing selection of content.) Meanwhile, Netflix hasn&#x2019;t been able to add subscribers at the swift pace it promised shareholders lately, a trend that could make it much harder to establish the &quot;virtuous cycle&quot; it&#x2019;s chasing&#x2014;that is, subscription fees enabling Netflix to acquire content that in turn attracts new subscribers, which will pay for more content. Profit margins, which are nearly 50 percent on the declining DVD side of the business, are only about 17 percent on the streaming side of the ledger. Smelling blood in the water, Carl Icahn, the notoriously intrusive takeover shark, snatched up 10 percent of Netflix&#x2019;s stock in October, probably hoping to force a sale to a deep-pocketed giant like Google or Facebook.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.q"> &quot;I really don&#x2019;t see how they can stay afloat alone,&quot; says a top TV ecutive (and yes, one of Hastings&#x2019;s key competitors), adding that the kind of high-quality original television Netflix plans to make is &quot;an incredibly expensive game to be in.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.r"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d3383655c24c6c94a262/master/w_806/entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-ladies-in-prison-show.jpg" alt="entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-ladies-in-prison-show.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;t=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-ladies-in-prison-show.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;t=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-ladies-in-prison-show.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d3383655c24c6c94a262%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-ladies-in-prison-show.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-ladies-in-prison-show.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnetflix-founder-reed-hastings-house-of-cards-arrested-development&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d3383655c24c6c94a262%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-ladies-in-prison-show.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-02-next-hbo-netflix-gq-intelligence-netflix-ladies-in-prison-show.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.s"> From the creator of <em>Weeds</em>, a ladies-in-prison show. </p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.t"> Like any CEO of a publicly owned company, Hastings doesn&#x2019;t rule out a sale someday. Just not today. Or tomorrow. And not on Icahn&#x2019;s timetable or at $95 a share. He believes that investing deeply in original content and driving deals like the one he made with Disney in December (exclusive streaming of all Disney films during the premium-cable window starting in 2016) will enable Netflix to grow to 90 million subscribers in the United States alone. That would be a hell of a trick, considering that at the moment there are only about 81 million homes with broadband. But he seems certain that Netflix will survive in entertainment&#x2019;s New Order, along with ESPN and HBO once those mighty brands figure out a graceful way to transition to stand-alone streaming. Those other guys? All those marginal channels that depend on being packaged in a basic-cable bundle, not to mention the cable companies themselves? He&#x2019;s not so sure.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.u"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.v"> &quot;What if you could radically alter the way stories get told?&quot; asks Ted Sarandos. &quot;What if the way people wanted to consume content actually changed what you could make?&quot; Rhetorical questions, perhaps, but the kind of things Netflix&#x2019;s chief content officer, its point man in Hollywood, likes to ponder when he has a down moment.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.w"> Which is hardly ever. These days, he is the man everyone wants to take a meeting with. People love you when you&#x2019;re handing out the cash, and Sarandos, who looks the part with pressed jeans and a crisp white shirt but has one of the weirdest r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;s in town (graduate of an Arizona community college, worked his way up in the DVD business from video-store clerk, landed at Netflix in 2000 to run distribution), has $6 billion to dole out over the next three years. Most of that is for licensing content from networks, cable companies, and movie studios, but about $300 million is for original programming. &quot;There&#x2019;s not a lot of really great, deep, serialized television,&quot; he says, &quot;and we can see from the data that that&#x2019;s what people want.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.x"> He hopes to make at least five new shows a year, he says, leaning back on a sofa in his Beverly Hills office in an anonymous-looking suite. His dream project: a Netflix series created by Warren Beatty. &quot;He&#x2019;s great in long form,&quot; Sarandos says. &quot;His only problems have been when he&#x2019;s constrained.&quot; Sarandos is also warming up Jodie Foster, who directed an episode of <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>. &quot;The goal,&quot; he says, &quot;is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.&quot; His seductive pitch to today&#x2019;s new breed of TV auteurs: a huge audience, real money, no meddlesome ecutives (&quot;I&#x2019;m not going to give David Fincher notes&quot;), no pilots (television&#x2019;s great sucking hole of money and hope), and a full-season commitment.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.y"> &quot;The idea that they wouldn&#x2019;t just pull the plug midway was totally thrilling,&quot; says Kohan, who spent years in the network trenches before making <em>Weeds</em> for Showtime. To her, &quot;It&#x2019;s similar to a pay-cable model but even more liberating. This is the future.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.z"> Sarandos is hoping his big tent will attract creators who want to explore the boundaries of storytelling. Binge viewing obviates the need for recaps and other clunky narrative devices. He isn&#x2019;t even wed to uniform episode lengths. What&#x2019;s so magical about twenty-two minutes or even a hour? &quot;I really think we have the chance to radically change the depth of character connectivity,&quot; he says. &quot;I mean, a <em>meaningful</em> shift. It&#x2019;s going to further blur the line between television and movies.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.10"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.11"> Hastings is staying at the Parker Meridien, a sleek midtown-Manhattan hotel, but he shuns the power-breakfast spot in the lobby, which is studded with young media types from nearby News Corp. and Time Warner in their slim-cut suits. Instead, in a gray button-down and pair of brown khakis, he sips a coffee at the local Pain Quotidien. He&#x2019;s in town for a board meeting of the charter-school network into which he pours millions. Education reform is where he concentrates his philanthropic efforts&#x2014;he even served on the California State Board of Education when Arnold Schwarzenegger was governor. He could probably dominate the board of his alma mater, Bowdoin, the small liberal-arts college in Maine, probably have a building named after him by now, but that just seems, well, pointless. He&#x2019;d rather disrupt a large system bound by archaic traditions and shoddy technology. Or rather, a second one.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.12"> &quot;You have to focus on one thing where you&#x2019;re clear on what kind of impact you want to have,&quot; he says. &quot;Otherwise you never get anything done.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.13"> Back in his hotel room, he&#x2019;s assembling the material for a December retreat in the Arizona desert with his top lieutenants. Amid strategy sessions on topics like the new &quot;meta-filters,&quot; the Kayak-like websites that could erode Netflix loyalty by letting consumers compare which services have the shows they want at the best prices, there will be Hobbes on nature, Jefferson on government, Yeats on the good life. And there&#x2019;s sure to be something in the program about resilience; Hastings still wrestles with guilt over mistakes he&#x2019;s made, especially the Qwikster debacle. &quot;You have to learn not to self-flagellate endlessly, to forgive yourself, but it&#x2019;s hard. In a creative business like this, you have to take risks, and sometimes you&#x2019;re wrong. You have to move on. I work a lot on that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.14"> These days Netflix is legendary in Silicon Valley for its so-called Culture Deck, the company&#x2019;s constitution. Nearly 3 million people have viewed it&#x2014;it&#x2019;s accessible on the Internet&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s a brilliant recruiting tool. Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, where Hastings holds a board seat, says it&#x2019;s the reason Facebook&#x2019;s directors pursued him. &quot;It may well be the most important document ever to come out of the Valley,&quot; she says.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.15"> The highlights: no limit on vacation days at Netflix, ditto for sick days. No one tells you when to come and go or clocks you when you do. Doing B-level work despite A-level effort will get you a severance package. (Annual attrition is a chilling 20 percent.) A-level work with minimal effort? More money and responsibility. Hastings tells me he has no idea how much vacation his people take on average, and he insists he doesn&#x2019;t care. Sure, there are times when people stay late, and there&#x2019;s plenty of e-mailing from home, but a typical day ends at six. (Hastings has no office on the company&#x2019;s five-building campus; he just floats around with his iPhone, checking in on people, pulling someone into a vacant conference room for a face-to-face.) &quot;You don&#x2019;t have to give up your life to do your job incredibly well,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.16"> Which isn&#x2019;t to say that Netflix is a laid-back place to work. Every employee, and most of all Hastings, is obsessively conscious of the mortal challenges the company faces&#x2014;but that doesn&#x2019;t stop him from sometimes making light of them. In late 2010, after Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes publicly dismissed Netflix as no more of a threat than the Albanian army, Hastings had Albanian army berets made for senior staff.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.17"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.18"> Will Arnett, who reprised his role as Gob Bluth for the new season of <em>Arrested Development</em>, gazes out from the curtained-off VIP area as the soldiers of the Netflix army stream into the back lot of Fox Studios in Century City. Nearly 1,000 strong, with geek flags flying, they wear plaid short-sleeve shirts over surf tees and tiny backpacks bulging with devices and chargers. They gawk at the taco truck parked under the giant mural of Tom Ewell fondling Marilyn in <em>The Seven Year Itch</em>, scoop chocolate-covered bananas from the portable freezer, queue up at the open bar, and gleefully scamper to the top of the Bluth &quot;stair car,&quot; iconic to <em>Arrested Development</em> groupies, for a photo op.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.19"> Not the usual wrap party, that&#x2019;s for sure, with grips and gaffers downing beers before their long rides home to Cerritos. Arnett still can&#x2019;t quite believe that the series has been resurrected, or that Hastings has flown in the company&#x2019;s entire staff&#x2014;a huge percentage of whom embody the show&#x2019;s core fan base&#x2014;from Silicon Valley to celebrate.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> &quot;These are our people,&quot; Arnett says, before slipping behind the curtain with co-stars Portia de Rossi, Michael Cera, and David Cross. It&#x2019;s hard to tell if that&#x2019;s pride in his voice or horror.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> Hastings ambles onto the lot with the crowd, nary an assistant&#x2014;he doesn&#x2019;t have one&#x2014;to clear his path. They say you can tell a lot about a company by how the troops act when the boss is around at a &quot;casual&quot; event&#x2014;the desperate tactics to score one-on-one suck-up time, the pathetic way they work to catch his eye. But when a bed-headed programmer in a <em>Banana Splits</em> tee accidentally jostles Hastings, the guy barely glances up from his iPad to say &quot;Oops&#x2014;sorry, man,&quot; before moving on.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> Without stopping for a drink, Hastings beelines for Peter Levinsohn, Fox&#x2019;s head of digital distribution. The production arm of Fox financed the original <em>Arrested Development</em>, which ran on the network but died of weak ratings despite its cult status. This time, Levinsohn made the deal with Netflix to produce another season for the site to stream.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> &quot;Peter&#x2019;s been a really great partner,&quot; says Hastings, flashing a gentle smile.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> This is where Levinsohn is supposed to chime in with: &quot;And Netflix has been a great partner, too! Isn&#x2019;t it wonderful that fans will be able to see another season of this wonderful show?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> But Levinsohn misses his cue. &quot;Well, overall it&#x2019;s been a good relationship.&quot; Hastings stiffens for a beat, then summons back the happy face. He spends a lot of time these days trying not to scare the cable companies and the networks so badly that they&#x2019;ll gang up on him, downplaying the idea that Netflix could eventually supplant outlets like Fox and NBC. But his happy face isn&#x2019;t working its magic right now. &quot;I&#x2019;d be lying if I said I wouldn&#x2019;t prefer if it were more, um, network-centric,&quot; says Levinsohn. &quot;Do you know what I mean?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> Hastings chuckles unconvincingly. Of course he knows. He knows that not even a guy like Levinsohn, who&#x2019;s gamely experimenting with the industry&#x2019;s new reality, can deny that he&#x2019;d much prefer a prime-time slot on a major network. They both know it&#x2019;s only a matter of time, and not much of it, before companies like Netflix and its phalanx of young and restless programmers and subscribers throw Hollywood off schedule permanently.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.1h"> &quot;Isn&#x2019;t this great?&quot; Hastings says, gently guiding Levinsohn past a replica red carpet where giddy engineers pose in front of a wall plastered with the Netflix logo. Instantly their photos are projected on a huge screen above the crowd.</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.1i"> &quot;Great,&quot; says Levinsohn, his voice as flat as a manhole cover. He doesn&#x2019;t look up. &quot;Absolutely fantastic.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".26futpd23nk.1.1.0.0.4.1j"> <em>Nancy Hass wrote about Terrell Owens in the February 2012 issue. </em></p></div><div
