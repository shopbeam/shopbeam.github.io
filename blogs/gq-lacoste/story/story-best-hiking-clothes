This summer we want to celebrate these great American places—along with the great American (and American-influenced) designers who have created a new camp-inspired look. It\u0027s part mountain man, part modern nomad, and equally at home on the sidewalk as it is on the trail. So tie on a bandanna (we\u0027ll show you how), Airbnb a cabin (we know just where to rent), and lace up a new pair of hiking boots. They\u0027ll look better with some trail dust.FacebookPinterestVest, $165, by Denim &amp; Supply Ralph Lauren. Shirt (around waist), $185, by Polo Ralph Lauren. T-shirt, $315, by Visvim.

Necklace by Bing Bang.5 Steps to Nailing the Brother Nature LookScrap the NASA-approved gear. It\u0027s the woods, not Mars. Opt for\u000Astuff you\u0027d actually find in nature: cotton, wool, leather.Layer up. You\u0027ll warm up while wandering; you\u0027ll cool off when the\u000Asun drops. Stash extra layers, or just tie that button-front shirt\u000Ato your waist.Ragg socks look rustic, and they help prevent blisters, even if you\u000Ahaven\u0027t broken in your boots.Bring a blanket. Better yet, bring a Pendleton waxed-cotton-backed\u000Ablanket.Acceptable accessories: a hat, a thin necklace, stubble, a canoe.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestBACK TO NATURE:  RIVERRide the Rapids at Columbia River Gorge, WashingtonThe river that separates Washington and Oregon looks out on America\u0027s addictive Pacific Northwest: skyscraping mountain ranges, glistening rocks, rolling grasslands. But it\u0027s also one of the best white-water-rafting locations in the world, and close enough to Portland that day trips aren\u0027t just possible, they\u0027re encouraged. You\u0027ll want to rent in White Salmon, Washington—and book your rafting trip in advance—but once you arrive, consider the whole border (and all its state parks) your playground.—MARK BYRNEFacebookPinterestWhat\u0027s the Best \u0022Thanks for Letting Me Stay at Your Vacation Home\u0022 Gift?As with most things, the answer is booze. It\u0027s the universal currency when you\u0027re welcomed into another person\u0027s vacation home, whether he\u0027s a close friend, a distant relative, or a vaguely hospitable frenemy. You bring wine for dinner, but for two or more nights under someone else\u0027s roof (especially if it\u0027s free), you bring booze. Hard stuff. Whiskey, like High West\u0027s smoky Campfire. Maybe a quality American gin, like Green Hat. Something you would be excited to drink. If the booze is local—either to where you\u0027re coming from or to where you\u0027re going to—all the better. Host is a teetotaler? Well, bring tea.—M.B.\u000A\u000AThe Goods:  A Little Camp Goes a Long WayThree key pieces that\u0027ll bring just a touch o\u0027 woodsman to your usual styleFacebookPinterestHat, $50, and T-shirt, $50, by Polo Ralph Lauren.

Bracelets by Del Toro (red) and Miansai.Do Not Kick the Bucket:\u000AThe sun acts all friendly, but it\u0027s not your friend. The aviators are self-explanatory (and work on everyone); the denim bucket hat keeps your ears from getting cooked and looks as chill as you\u0027ll feel after drinking a sixer on the deck.FacebookPinterestLEFT:Watch, $125, by Nautica.

The ruggedness of a great field watch comes in handy in the woods and, when paired with a bright band and some equally punchy wristwear, brings some brawn to your citified weekday style.Boots with a Sneaker Soul:\u000AWhether you\u0027re roaming upriver or hustling to the subway, you want hikers like these from Danner—lightweight and mountain-ready, but with buttery suede and retro style.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestShirt, $155, and crewneck, $145, by Alex Mill.

Teach Your Closet to Speak CabinYou don\u0027t need a new wardrobe to go from Starbucksing in the city to stargazing in the country. \u0022What you want is comfort and necessity,\u0022 says Alex Drexler, the man behind one of our favorite new clothing lines, Alex Mill. It\u0027s stocked with lived-in basics that work in both worlds, like striped tees and broken-in chambray. In the woods, wear them loose and don\u0027t be afraid of a little dirt. Because when you take your girl on a rustic weekend, she expects a mountain man, not a prissy one.—MARK ANTHONY GREENFacebookPinterestBACK TO NATURE:  MOUNTAINGo Big in Western MontanaThis is Big Sky Country, and goddamn is that true. From the sprawling acreage that abuts your Airbnb, you\u0027ll see nothing but sunshine and crags close enough to touch. Focus your Airbnb search on the areas just outside Livingston and Bozeman, where ex-big-city types support well-stocked general stores, cafés, and pubs. On day two, drive to Gallatin Canyon for a day hike, or just set up shop on your front porch and be reminded that silence is more than a setting on your phone.—M.B.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestVest, $198, by Nautica.

Her tank top, bikini top, and cardigan by Polo Ralph Lauren.Man SkillsGet Lit the Right WaySTEP 1\u000ABuild a Better PitThe old dirt pit with a rock rim works—but it\u0027s not perfect. What you really want is an open passage for airflow on one side and a large flat rock opposite that\u0027ll aim smoke upward—not into your face.STEP 2\u000AFind That Creative Spark\u000ATinder—plus a trusty Bic—is the key to getting your blaze going. Good: dry twigs (not leaves; they smoke). Better: dry twigs doused in high-proof booze. Best: dryer lint. Seriously.STEP 3\u000AGo on a Kindling MissionGrab lots of kindling—small sticks and thin branches that vary in width from pencil to Sharpie. If the ground is wet, nab dangling branches or steal from a dying shrub. Sorry, shrub.STEP 4\u000AConstruction ZoneThe tepee: iffy shelter, perfect fire architecture. Center your tinder in the pit. Light it, add some kindling, then build a three-log \u0022tepee\u0022 above it. Shout \u0022There is fire!\u0022 and accept your glory.—BENJY HANSEN-BUNDY\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestBACK TO NATURE:  LAKEMan the Rudder on Lake Rabun, GeorgiaUsually lakes are so large they attract boats of perma-spring-breakers, or they\u0027re so private you can\u0027t stay lakeside without a mortgage. Rabun is the happy medium: a dammed-up twisty bend of the Tallulah River that now doubles as Atlanta\u0027s favorite escape hatch. VRBO.com is your best bet for waterfront cabins. The lake itself is cozy enough for a late-night skinny dip and big enough to skim in a rented pontoon boat ($250 a day from the Rabun Boathouse, $30 for a case of Bud Heavy).—M.B.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestBackpack, $269, by Pendleton Woolen Mills.Have a Nice Trip, Man!One guy\u0027s secret to really getting into the great outdoors? \u0027Shrooms!\u0022I\u0027m not feeling a damn thing,\u0022 I said to the three other people sitting on a rock with me in a tiny coastal inlet in nowhere Maine. I\u0027d come up here—along with my fiancée and two friends—saddled with that modern desperation felt by city dwellers who post Facebook links to stories about how technology is swallowing our lives. Which is exactly why I was so bummed these \u0027shrooms weren\u0027t working. It was my first time. I wanted out of my head. Then: \u0022Never mind,\u0022 I said. \u0022The earth\u0027s breathing.\u0022I won\u0027t bore you with the details of that first trip—psych, yes, I will. The horizon rose and softly fell, like the chest of a girl sleeping in bed, but less creepy to watch! Boulders in the bay slid across my vision like the logs in Frogger! The fog felt like a sexy, mysterious blanket! I smiled goofily. I didn\u0027t take a single Instagram. And for the first time in too long, the natural world and I vibed in a proper I-am-small, you-are-primal-and-awe-inspiring way.Ultimately, that\u0027s what you want out of a sojourn into the great outdoors, right? Relaxation, sure, but a reminder that there\u0027s more to life beyond direct deposit and critically acclaimed TV. \u0027Shrooms get you into that mind-set and get you there quickly—which is key if you\u0027ve only got a three-day weekend, not three months to walk the Appalachian Trail. But there are some important rules to embarking on your own psychotropic hookup with Mother Nature.A little \u0027shroomage goes a long way, because a lot can go very badly. Eat just a few. Or steep them in tea. Or do as I did and find some yuppie dealer who makes \u0027shroom chocolates, which taste good, instead of like earthy ass. You want a couple of hours of blissful observation, not twenty years of flashbacks to melting trees with crying faces.Have snacks. No explanation needed.And when the \u0027shrooms kick in, find a way to break off quietly from the group to do your own thing. Wander, sit motionless and listen to birds, or, like my friend did, touch a bunch of plants and rocks until you find something that feels amazing. (Hint: moss.) Otherwise you\u0027re stuck listening to everyone narrating his own high, and there\u0027s nothing worse than some dude who\u0027s tripping on \u0027shrooms and wants to tell everyone about it.—JON WILDE",

Which means you&apos;re missing out on the rest of the country: cabins in the woods, swimming holes, and hiking trails with no cell service. This summer we want to celebrate these great American places&#x2014;along with the great American (and American-influenced) designers who have created a new camp-inspired look. It&apos;s part mountain man, part modern nomad, and equally at home on the sidewalk as it is on the trail. So tie on a bandanna (we&apos;ll show you how), Airbnb a cabin (we know just where to rent), and lace up a new pair of hiking boots.

You bring wine for dinner, but for two or more nights under someone else&apos;s roof (especially if it&apos;s free), you bring booze. Hard stuff. Whiskey, like High West&apos;s smoky Campfire. Maybe a quality American gin, like Green Hat. Something you would be excited to drink.

<strong>Build a Better Pit</strong><br>The old dirt pit with a rock rim works&#x2014;but it&apos;s not perfect.

<strong>Go on a Kindling Mission</strong><br>Grab lots of kindling&#x2014;small sticks and thin branches that vary in width from pencil to Sharpie.

I&apos;d come up here&#x2014;along with my fianc&#xE9;e and two friends&#x2014;saddled with that modern desperation felt by city dwellers who post Facebook links to stories about how technology is swallowing our lives. Which is exactly why I was so bummed these &apos;shrooms weren&apos;t working. It was my first time. I wanted out of my head. Then: &quot;Never mind,&quot; I said. &quot;The earth&apos;s breathing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29fppp8cu8.1.1.0.0.4.7:4">I won&apos;t bore you with the details of that first trip&#x2014;<em>psych,</em> yes, I will. The horizon rose and softly fell, like the chest of a girl sleeping in bed, but less creepy to watch! Boulders in the bay slid across my vision like the logs in Frogger! The fog felt like a sexy, mysterious blanket! I smiled goofily. I didn&apos;t take a single Instagram. And for the first time in too long, the natural world and I vibed in a proper I-am-small, you-are-primal-and-awe-inspiring way.</p><p data-reactid=".29fppp8cu8.1.1.0.0.4.7:5">Ultimately, that&apos;s what you want out of a sojourn into the great outdoors, right? Relaxation, sure, but a reminder that there&apos;s more to life beyond direct deposit and critically acclaimed TV. &apos;Shrooms get you into that mind-set and get you there quickly&#x2014;which is key if you&apos;ve only got a three-day weekend, not three months to walk the Appalachian Trail. But there are some important rules to embarking on your own psychotropic hookup with Mother Nature.</p><p data-reactid=".29fppp8cu8.1.1.0.0.4.7:6">A little &apos;shroomage goes a long way, because a lot can go very badly. Eat just a few. Or steep them in tea. Or do as I did and find some yuppie dealer who makes &apos;shroom chocolates, which taste good, instead of like earthy ass. You want a couple of hours of blissful observation, not twenty years of flashbacks to melting trees with crying faces.</p><p data-reactid=".29fppp8cu8.1.1.0.0.4.7:7">Have snacks. No explanation needed.</p><p data-reactid=".29fppp8cu8.1.1.0.0.4.7:8">And when the &apos;shrooms kick in, find a way to break off quietly from the group to do your own thing. Wander, sit motionless and listen to birds, or, like my friend did, touch a bunch of plants and rocks until you find something that feels amazing. (Hint: moss.) Otherwise you&apos;re stuck listening to everyone narrating his own high, and there&apos;s nothing worse than some dude who&apos;s tripping on &apos;shrooms and wants to tell everyone about it.<br><strong>&#x2014;JON WILDE</strong></p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".29fppp8cu8.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".29fppp8cu8.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
