  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI think my life is better because of my iPhone. Yours probably is, too. I\u0027m grateful to live in a time when I can see my baby cousins or experience any album ever without getting out of bed. I\u0027m grateful that I will literally never be lost again, so long as my phone has battery. And I\u0027m grateful that there are so many people so much smarter than I am who devise things like this, which are magical for the first week they show up, then a given in my life a week later.\u000A\u000AWe live in an era of technical ability that would have nauseated our ancestors with wonder, and so much of it comes from one very small place in California. But all these unimpeachable humanoid upgrades—the smartphones, the Google-gifted knowledge—are increasingly the exception, rather than the rule, of Silicon Valley\u0027s output. What was once a land of upstarts and rebels is now being led by the money-hungry and the unspirited. Which is why we have a start-up that mails your dog curated treats and an app that says \u0022Yo.\u0022 The brightest minds in tech just lately seem more concerned with silly business ideas and innocuous \u0022disruption,\u0022 all for the shot at an immense payday. And when our country\u0027s smartest people are working on the dumbest things, we all lose out.\u000A\u000AThat gap between the Silicon Valley that enriches the world and the Silicon Valley that wastes itself on the trivial is widening daily. And one of the biggest contributing factors is that the Valley has lost touch with reality by subscribing to its own self-congratulatory mythmaking. That these beliefs are mostly baseless, or at least egotistically distorted, is a problem—not just for Silicon Valley but for the rest of us. Which is why we\u0027re here to help the Valley tear down its own myths—these seven in particular.\u000A\u000AMyth #1: Silicon Valley Is the Universe\u0027s Only True Meritocracy\u000A\u000AEveryone in Silicon Valley has convinced himself he\u0027s helped create a free-market paradise, the software successor to Jefferson\u0027s brotherhood of noble yeomen. \u0022Silicon Valley has this way of finding greatness and supporting it,\u0022 said a member of Greylock Partners, a major venture-capital firm with over $2 billion under management. \u0022It values meritocracy more than anyplace else.\u0022 After complaints of the start-up economy\u0027s profound whiteness reached mainstream discussion just last year, companies like Apple, Facebook, and Twitter reluctantly released internal diversity reports. The results were as homogenized as expected: At Twitter, 79 percent of the leadership is male and 72 percent of it is white. At Facebook, senior positions are 77 percent male and 74 percent white. Twitter—a company whose early success can be directly attributed to the pioneering downloads of black smartphone users—hosts an entirely white board of directors. It\u0027s a pounding indictment of Silicon Valley\u0027s corporate psyche that Mark Zuckerberg—a bourgeois white kid from suburban New York who attended Harvard—is considered the Horatio Alger 2.0 paragon. When Paul Graham, the then head of the massive start-up incubator Y Combinator, told The New York Times that he could \u0022be tricked by anyone who looks like Mark Zuckerberg,\u0022 he wasn\u0027t just talking about Zuck\u0027s youth.\u000A\u000AIf there\u0027s any reassuring news, it\u0027s not that tech\u0027s diversity crisis is getting better, but that in the face of so much dismal news, people are becoming angry enough and brave enough to admit that the state of things is not good. Silicon Valley loves data, after all, and with data readily demonstrating tech\u0027s overwhelming white-guy problem, even the true believers in meritocracy see the circumstances as they actually are.\u000A\u000AEarlier this year, Ellen Pao became the most mentioned name in Silicon Valley as her gender-discrimination suit against her former employer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, played out in court. Although the jury sided with the legendary VC firm, the Pao case was a watershed moment, bringing sunlight and national scrutiny to the issue of unchecked Valley sexism. For every defeated Ellen Pao, we can hope there are a hundred other female technology workers who feel new courage to speak up against wrongdoing, and a thousand male co-workers and employers who\u0027ll reconsider their boys\u0027-club bullshit. But they\u0027ve got their work cut out for them.\u000A\u000AMyth #2: Silicon Valley Is Bringing Us Closer Together\u000A\u000AFacebook\u0027s stated mission, it reminds us ceaselessly, is to \u0022connect the whole world\u0022—a sappy global village philosophy that dovetails nicely with data mining and targeting ads. As a verb, connect pulls a lot of freight for start-ups every day. There are companies to connect you to other companies, connect you to your neighbors, connect you to the grocery store, and connect you to your increasingly fat ass. There are apps to connect you to your own family.\u000A\u000ABut the marketing line that most precisely captures the Valley\u0027s social attitude isn\u0027t Facebook\u0027s—it\u0027s GrubHub\u0027s. A recent tag for the food-delivery firm reads \u0022Everything great about eating, combined with everything great about not talking to people.\u0022 A New York subway ad for Seamless (which merged with GrubHub) reads \u0022Your favorite part of having a smartphone is never having to call anyone.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe real undercurrent of start-up strategizing isn\u0027t socialization—rather, it\u0027s the opposite: Social anxiety is the primary economic force in California today. The tech economy is pushed forward not by a desire to meet new people but by a desire to avoid human contact at all costs—unless it\u0027s to-your-doorstep on demand. Uber excuses you from the subway, Seamless obviates a phone call, and Tinder lets you navigate the faces you might\u0027ve met at a bar if you\u0027d had the motivation to leave your apartment. Uber and Lyft have brought thousands of new people from our communities into our lives—but only as our chauffeurs. The brightest and buzziest apps aren\u0027t about connecting me to you, but rather about never forcing us to acknowledge that anyone else exists in real life as anything but the help.\u000A\u000AWhat new human contact these start-ups actually do foster is barely human contact at all—everything is mediated through an algorithm, a button, a swipe, or a GPS beacon. The Uber is here, we\u0027ll say, pointing at a person in a car. A TaskRabbit might help you set up your furniture, a person synonymous with the corporate brand. Even apps like Instagram, meant to be used between pals, have turned into a sluice box for likes and affirmation. When even our genuine friendships are being quantified, what hope can we possibly have for treating labor as more than a pack of pils?\u000A\u000AMyth #3: Younger Is Smarter, Safer, and Inarguably Better\u000A\u000ASilicon Valley speaks constantly of \u0022the Next Mark Zuckerberg,\u0022 by which people mean \u0022the Next Almighty Child-God.\u0022 Mark Zuckerberg was, of course, only 19 years old when he flipped the switch on TheFacebook.com in his Harvard dorm. That\u0027s impressive! Only a few years later, he became the world\u0027s youngest billionaire.\u000A\u000AHe was also among the first to acknowledge—and credit—his own youthfulness as Facebook began to skyrocket. \u0022I want to stress the importance of being young and technical,\u0022 he proclaimed before an audience of start-up kids in a Stanford auditorium. \u0022Young people are just smarter. Why are most chess masters under 30? I don\u0027t know.\u0022 It\u0027s true: Zuckerberg probably doesn\u0027t know why most chess masters are under 30. But his point here is clear: Hire or invest in anyone older than I am and you\u0027re probably wasting your time.\u000A\u000AThis doctrine has been furthered by the Silicon Valley establishment—most notoriously by Paul Graham, who said he was a sucker for a kid who looks like Zuck. (Graham\u0027s habit of confirming his own proclivities for younger people in tech caught up with him when he named 28-year-old Sam Altman, the firm\u0027s second-youngest partner, as his successor.)\u000A\u000AZuck, though, is the prototypical once-in-a-generation outlier prodigy. And the fallacy of youth fails to bear out in Silicon Valley all the time. For every Snapchat and Box, there\u0027s a Rap Genius, a Canvas, and, well, a Tumblr. There\u0027s been no bigger industry humiliation and repudiation of the youth myth than the case of Clinkle, a personal-finance app that somehow managed to be an even greater disaster than its name. In 2013, a cadre of ostensibly sane investors gave Lucas Duplan, a 22-year-old Stanford graduate who moonlights as your friend\u0027s annoying little brother, more than $25 million in venture backing. These investors weren\u0027t crackpots: They included big names like Richard Branson, who posed eagerly next to Duplan\u0027s smooth, childish face in photos. They both grinned wide, but Branson grinned widest: I\u0027ve found my Next Zuckerberg, you sons of bitches.\u000A\u000AClinkle, with Duplan at the controls, was unable to deliver a single scrap of software to the public in more than a year. Instead, Duplan fired swaths of staffers while planning his corner office in a new building; other underlings quit in disgust. Company morale bottomed out at around the same time Clinkle was hacked, revealing a selfie of Duplan holding a large handful of cash. When Clinkle launched its app (far more modest than he\u0027d described years before), it landed with a thud.\u000A\u000APainful as it is to watch a corporate car crash with a baby at the wheel, these disasters might be the only way the industry will learn; that, and watching actual adults succeed. Zuckerberg, to his credit, was pretty quick to cede big-boy managerial duties to business-savvy adults and stick to his strength as the social-media prophet-in-chief. But what would be more useful than studying a wave of cautionary tales is to pay attention to grand-slam exceptions—success stories worth emulating, like that of Jan Koum and Brian Acton, who flipped their instant-messaging company WhatsApp to Facebook for almost $20 billion. The duo are 39 and 43, respectively, almost octogenarian by founder standards, yet responsible for one of the greatest software successes (and investor returns) in Silicon Valley\u0027s history. And there\u0027s a reason most people had never heard their names before their gigantic fortune: All along they\u0027d acted like grown-ups.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMyth #4: School Is for Suckers, Just Drop Out\u000A\u000AEvery year, PayPal co-founder, investor-guru, and rabid libertarian Peter Thiel awards a small group of college-age students the Thiel Fellowship, a paid offer to either drop out or forgo college entirely. In exchange, the students receive money, mentorship, and networking opportunities from Thiel as they pursue a start-up of their choice. We\u0027re frequently reminded of the tech titans of industry who never got a degree—Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg are the most cited, though the fact that they\u0027re statistical exceptions is an aside at best. To be young in Silicon Valley is great; to be a young dropout is golden.\u000A\u000AThe virtuous dropout hasn\u0027t just made college seem optional for many aspiring barons—formal education is now excoriated in Silicon Valley as an obsolete system dreamed up by people who\u0027d never heard of photo filters or Snapchat. Mix this cynicism with the libertarian streak many tech entrepreneurs carry already and you\u0027ve got yourself a legit anti-education movement.\u000A\u000AAnd for what? There\u0027s no evidence that avoiding a conventional education today grants business success tomorrow. The gifted few who end up dropping out and changing tech history would have probably changed tech history anyway—you can\u0027t learn start-up greatness by refusing to learn in a college classroom. And given that most start-ups fail, do we want an appreciable segment of bright young people gambling so heavily on being the next Zuck? More important, do we want an economy of CEOs who never had to learn to get along with their dorm-mates? Who never had the opportunity to grow up and figure out how to be a human being functioning in society? Who went straight from a bedroom in their parents\u0027 house to an incubator that paid for their meals? It\u0027s no wonder tech has an antisocial rep.\u000A\u000AMyth #5: Coding Is the Key to the Kingdom\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a dictate, a mantra. You hear it when you lift your Fitbit-ed wrist to your head and cup your hand to your ear: Go west, young man, and learn to code. It\u0027s only natural that Silicon Valley\u0027s thought sherpas have come to fetishize the skills of the coder. For those inside the Silicon bubble, knowing a computer language is as much a lifestyle as it is a LinkedIn bullet point—and moreover, it\u0027s salvation. (Just one illustrative anecdote: Last summer, a \u0022compassionate entrepreneur\u0022/aspiring Henry Higgins launched a campaign to teach coding skills in an effort to eradicate the homelessness problem in San Francisco. That\u0027s how entrenched the belief is.)\u000A\u000AAccording to Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape, \u0022Learning to code is the single best thing anyone can do to get the most out of the amazing future in front of us.\u0022 That\u0027s one hell of a statement at a time when more than 30 million American adults can\u0027t read well. Deep-pocketed technologists are pushing for coding to become not just part of career training but a core curriculum item, alongside history and biology. Code.org, a nonprofit supported by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, has racked up millions in donations from the infamously philanthropy-averse denizens of the Valley.\u000A\u000AComputer fluency should be mandatory for every American student. We\u0027d be well served by growing the number of students—particularly young girls—with access to a robust computer-science curriculum. But convincing ourselves that being able to write JavaScript is not just the best skill to have but the only true skill worth having is to buy into the Valley worldview a thousand times over. When we accept it as a badge of virtue, we give Silicon Valley hubris a stamp of validation.\u000A\u000AMyth #6: San Francisco Is the (Moral, Cultural, Financial) Center of the Universe\u000A\u000ABoomtown San Francisco has an ego that makes New York and Los Angeles blush. The Bay Area—at least for those who consider skyrocketing rents a point of pride—isn\u0027t just the best place to be, but the only place to be. It\u0027s a simple argument: Technological innovation is the only innovation worth a damn today, and all of it is happening in or around San Francisco.\u000A\u000AIn 2014, Y Combinator czar Sam Altman said, \u0022All the growth in the economy right now is in tech, and the only thing that is working is tech.\u0022 This claim has been thoroughly debunked, but it underscored a greater belief in what matters in America and what doesn\u0027t. The previous year, Chamath Palihapitiya, a major start-up investor and part owner of the Golden State Warriors, made his SF-centrism explicit:\u000A\u000A\u0022The center of power is here, make no mistake.... It\u0027s becoming excruciatingly, obviously clear to everyone else that where value is created is no longer in New York, it\u0027s no longer in Washington, it\u0027s no longer in L.A. It\u0027s in San Francisco and the Bay Area.... Because markets value meaningful events, markets discount meaningless events. And so the functional value of the government is effectively discounted to zero.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn other words, why haven\u0027t we just replaced Congress with an app? What if the same minds that brought you Instagram were trusted with HealthCare.gov? Value in this case doesn\u0027t just mean dollars; this is a declaration that all human activity of worth is transpiring within one segment of one industry in a single geographic sliver of the country.\u000A\u000ABalaji Srinivasan, an Andreessen Horowitz ecutive (who\u0027s also basically a secessionist-movement leader), famously calls everything outside Silicon Valley the \u0022Paper Belt.\u0022 It\u0027s a powerful rhetorical weapon for the delusional barons who live there; if we criticize them, it\u0027s because we\u0027re from the Paper Belt, it\u0027s because we don\u0027t \u0022get\u0022 tech. If we undermine them, we\u0027re undermining the country\u0027s last remaining font of Value.\u000A\u000AWhat everyone forgets, though, is what Paul Graham, of all people, made very clear back in 2006: Silicon Valley could\u0027ve happened anywhere. There\u0027s nothing particularly special about the Bay Area, its adjacent regions, or anyone who lives there. \u0022I think you only need two kinds of people to create a technology hub,\u0022 Graham explained: \u0022rich people and nerds.\u0022 The Silicon Valley nexus isn\u0027t Rome, or even Atlantic City. It\u0027s just a place that hosts a glut of coders and people with enough money to fund even the worst ideas—most of which rely on the fundamental conviction that technology\u0027s greatest power is that it can put us anywhere virtually, without the need to be there physically. Without the need to all gather in one blessed metropolitan area.\u000A\u000AThankfully, start-up incubators in other American cities are gaining ground. Cities like Baltimore—former industrial powerhouses now left with vast tracts of abandoned real estate and a low cost of living—are ripe for a techno rebirth. Groups like ETC and Betamore (in Baltimore) are helping founders get started in cities that need them rather than loathe them.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMyth #7: Silicon Valley Is Saving the World\u000A\u000ATwo years ago, an online list of \u002257 start-up lessons\u0022 made its way through the coder community, bolstered by a co-sign from Paul Graham. \u0022Wow, is this list good,\u0022 he commented. \u0022It has the kind of resonance you only get when you\u0027re writing from a lot of hard experience.\u0022 Among the platitudinous menagerie was this gem: \u0022If it doesn\u0027t augment the human condition for a huge number of people in a meaningful way, it\u0027s not worth doing.\u0022 In a mission statement published on Andreessen Horowitz\u0027s website, Marc Andreessen claimed he was \u0022looking for the companies who are going to be the big winners because they are going to cause a fundamental change in the world.\u0022 The firm\u0027s portfolio includes Ringly (maker of rings that light up when your phone does something), Teespring (custom T-shirts), DogVacay (pet-sitters on demand), and Hem (the zombified corpse of the furniture store Fab.com). Last year, wealthy Facebook alum Justin Rosenstein told a packed audience at TechCrunch Disrupt, \u0022We in this room, we in technology, have a greater capacity to change the world than the kings and presidents of even a hundred years ago.\u0022 No one laughed, even though Rosenstein\u0027s company, Asana, sells instant-messaging software.\u000A\u000AThis isn\u0027t just a matter of preening guys in fleece vests building giant companies predicated on their own personal annoyances. It\u0027s wasteful and genuinely harmful to have so many people working on such trivial projects (Clinkle and fucking Yo) under the auspices of world-historical greatness. At one point recently, there were four separate on-demand laundry services operating in San Francisco, each no doubt staffed by smart young people who thought they were carving out a place of small software greatness. And yet for every laundry app, there are smart people doing smart, valuable things: Among the most recent batch of Y Combinator start-ups featured during March\u0027s \u0022Demo Day\u0022 were Diassess (twenty-minute HIV tests), Standard Cyborg (3D-printed limbs), and Atomwise (using supercomputing to develop new medical compounds). Those start-ups just happen to be sharing desk space at the incubator with \u0022world changers\u0022 like Lumi (easy logo printing) and Underground Cellar (\u0022curated, limited-edition wines with a twist\u0022).\u000A\u000AWhat makes the pervading mythologies so frustrating is the smug certainty of Silicon Valley that its contributions to society are more important than every other industry\u0027s. It\u0027s not that we can\u0027t deal with assholes in our national midst (there\u0027s no innovating our way out of that); it\u0027s that no prior cohort of rich pricks have fooled themselves, and the rest of us, so thoroughly. And what a drag. At its best, Silicon Valley creates things we can\u0027t fathom living without, the toys that become staples that become culture itself. Businesses like Uber and Airbnb that might\u0027ve seemed like fads a decade ago are now powerhouse companies* that provide thousands with stable, high-paying jobs.\u000A\u000AThe reason we\u0027re calling out Silicon Valley\u0027s lies is a selfish one: We\u0027re tired of feeling conflicted about the moral implications of summoning an on-demand cab, or wondering if our social network of choice is run by a suite of guys who look like Mr. Monopoly. We just want these places to act like the capitalist free-market solutions they are, not humanity\u0027s saviors. Palo Alto just isn\u0027t Renaissance Florence, and that\u0027s perfectly fine. Wall Street is easily more villainous than the Valley, but it harbors no delusions of heroism. Our national contempt for finance and banking acts as a sort of check on Wall Street\u0027s actions—a way of keeping J.P. Morgan from literally torching small towns and selling the ashes. And that\u0027s all we need with Silicon Valley: a watchful eye and an intelligent wariness of any self-satisfied bullshit. This is a start.\u000A\u000A * This sentence has been updated to remove language from an earlier version, which printed in error and misstated the fact that Uber and Airbnb are publicly traded companies.\u000A\u000ASAM BIDDLE (@samfbiddle) is a senior writer at Gawker and the former editor of Valleywag.

better because of my iPhone. Yours probably is, too. I&#x2019;m grateful to live in a time when I can see my baby cousins or experience any album ever without getting out of bed. I&#x2019;m grateful that I will literally never be lost again, so long as my phone has battery. And I&#x2019;m grateful that there are so many people so much smarter than I am who devise things like this, which are magical for the first week they show up, then a given in my life a week later.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.2">We live in an era of technical ability that would have nauseated our ancestors with wonder, and so much of it comes from one very small place in California. But all these unimpeachable humanoid upgrades&#x2014;the smartphones, the Google-gifted knowledge&#x2014;are increasingly the exception, rather than the rule, of Silicon Valley&#x2019;s output. What was once a land of upstarts and rebels is now being led by the money-hungry and the unspirited. Which is why we have a start-up that mails your dog curated treats and an app that says &quot;Yo.&quot; The brightest minds in tech just lately seem more concerned with silly business ideas and innocuous &quot;disruption,&quot; all for the shot at an immense payday. And when our country&#x2019;s smartest people are working on the dumbest things, we all lose out.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.3">That gap between the Silicon Valley that enriches the world and the Silicon Valley that wastes itself on the trivial is widening daily. And one of the biggest contributing factors is that the Valley has lost touch with reality by subscribing to its own self-congratulatory mythmaking. That these beliefs are mostly baseless, or at least egotistically distorted, is a problem&#x2014;not just for Silicon Valley but for the rest of us. Which is why we&#x2019;re here to help the Valley tear down its own myths&#x2014;these seven in particular.</p><div class="embed h4" data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.5"><h4><strong>Myth #1: Silicon Valley Is the Universe&#x2019;s Only True Meritocracy</strong></h4></div><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.6">Everyone in Silicon Valley has convinced himself he&#x2019;s helped create a free-market paradise, the software successor to Jefferson&#x2019;s brotherhood of noble yeomen. &quot;Silicon Valley has this way of finding greatness and supporting it,&quot; said a member of Greylock Partners, a major venture-capital firm with over $2 billion under management. &quot;It values meritocracy more than anyplace else.&quot; After complaints of the start-up economy&#x2019;s profound whiteness reached mainstream discussion just last year, companies like Apple, Facebook, and Twitter reluctantly released internal diversity reports. The results were as homogenized as expected: At Twitter, 79 percent of the leadership is male and 72 percent of it is white. At Facebook, senior positions are 77 percent male and 74 percent white. Twitter&#x2014;a company whose early success can be directly attributed to the pioneering downloads of black smartphone users&#x2014;hosts an entirely white board of directors. It&#x2019;s a pounding indictment of Silicon Valley&#x2019;s corporate psyche that Mark Zuckerberg&#x2014;a bourgeois white kid from suburban New York who attended Harvard&#x2014;is considered the Horatio Alger 2.0 paragon. When Paul Graham, the then head of the massive start-up incubator Y Combinator, told <em>The New York Times</em> that he could &quot;be tricked by anyone who looks like Mark Zuckerberg,&quot; he wasn&#x2019;t just talking about Zuck&#x2019;s youth.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.7">If there&#x2019;s any reassuring news, it&#x2019;s not that tech&#x2019;s diversity crisis is getting better, but that in the face of so much dismal news, people are becoming angry enough and brave enough to admit that the state of things is not good. Silicon Valley loves data, after all, and with data readily demonstrating tech&#x2019;s overwhelming white-guy problem, even the true believers in meritocracy see the circumstances as they actually are.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.8">Earlier this year, Ellen Pao became the most mentioned name in Silicon Valley as her gender-discrimination suit against her former employer, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, played out in court. Although the jury sided with the legendary VC firm, the Pao case was a watershed moment, bringing sunlight and national scrutiny to the issue of unchecked Valley sexism. For every defeated Ellen Pao, we can hope there are a hundred other female technology workers who feel new courage to speak up against wrongdoing, and a thousand male co-workers and employers who&#x2019;ll reconsider their boys&#x2019;-club bullshit. But they&#x2019;ve got their work cut out for them.</p><div class="embed h4" data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.9"><h4><strong>Myth #2: Silicon Valley Is Bringing Us Closer Together</strong></h4></div><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.a">Facebook&#x2019;s stated mission, it reminds us ceaselessly, is to &quot;connect the whole world&quot;&#x2014;a sappy <em>global village</em> philosophy that dovetails nicely with data mining and targeting ads. As a verb, <em>connect</em> pulls a lot of freight for start-ups every day. There are companies to connect you to other companies, connect you to your neighbors, connect you to the grocery store, and connect you to your increasingly fat ass. There are apps to connect you to your own family.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.b">But the marketing line that most precisely captures the Valley&#x2019;s social attitude isn&#x2019;t Facebook&#x2019;s&#x2014;it&#x2019;s GrubHub&#x2019;s. A recent tag for the food-delivery firm reads &quot;Everything great about eating, combined with everything great about not talking to people.&quot; A New York subway ad for Seamless (which merged with GrubHub) reads &quot;Your favorite part of having a smartphone is never having to call anyone.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.c">The real undercurrent of start-up strategizing isn&#x2019;t socialization&#x2014;rather, it&#x2019;s the opposite: Social anxiety is the primary economic force in California today. The tech economy is pushed forward not by a desire to meet new people but by a desire to avoid human contact at all costs&#x2014;unless it&#x2019;s to-your-doorstep on demand. Uber excuses you from the subway, Seamless obviates a phone call, and Tinder lets you navigate the faces you might&#x2019;ve met at a bar if you&#x2019;d had the motivation to leave your apartment. Uber and Lyft have brought thousands of new people from our communities into our lives&#x2014;but only as our chauffeurs. The brightest and buzziest apps aren&#x2019;t about connecting me to you, but rather about never forcing us to acknowledge that anyone else exists in real life as anything but the help.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.d">What new human contact these start-ups actually do foster is barely human contact at all&#x2014;everything is mediated through an algorithm, a button, a swipe, or a GPS beacon. <em>The Uber is here,</em> we&#x2019;ll say, pointing at a person in a car. A TaskRabbit might help you set up your furniture, a person synonymous with the corporate brand. Even apps like Instagram, meant to be used between pals, have turned into a sluice box for likes and affirmation. When even our genuine friendships are being quantified, what hope can we possibly have for treating labor as more than a pack of pils?</p><div class="embed h4" data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.e"><h4><strong>Myth #3: Younger Is Smarter, Safer, and Inarguably Better</strong></h4></div><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.f">Silicon Valley speaks constantly of &quot;the Next Mark Zuckerberg,&quot; by which people mean &quot;the Next Almighty Child-God.&quot; Mark Zuckerberg was, of course, only 19 years old when he flipped the switch on TheFacebook.com in his Harvard dorm. That&#x2019;s impressive! Only a few years later, he became the world&#x2019;s youngest billionaire.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.g">He was also among the first to acknowledge&#x2014;and credit&#x2014;his own youthfulness as Facebook began to skyrocket. &quot;I want to stress the importance of being young and technical,&quot; he proclaimed before an audience of start-up kids in a Stanford auditorium. &quot;Young people are just smarter. Why are most chess masters under 30? I don&#x2019;t know.&quot; It&#x2019;s true: Zuckerberg probably doesn&#x2019;t know why most chess masters are under 30. But his point here is clear: Hire or invest in anyone older than I am and you&#x2019;re probably wasting your time.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.h">This doctrine has been furthered by the Silicon Valley establishment&#x2014;most notoriously by Paul Graham, who said he was a sucker for a kid who looks like Zuck. (Graham&#x2019;s habit of confirming his own proclivities for younger people in tech caught up with him when he named 28-year-old Sam Altman, the firm&#x2019;s second-youngest partner, as his successor.)</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.i">Zuck, though, is the prototypical once-in-a-generation outlier prodigy. And the fallacy of youth fails to bear out in Silicon Valley all the time. For every Snapchat and Box, there&#x2019;s a Rap Genius, a Canvas, and, well, a Tumblr. There&#x2019;s been no bigger industry humiliation and repudiation of the youth myth than the case of Clinkle, a personal-finance app that somehow managed to be an even greater disaster than its name. In 2013, a cadre of ostensibly sane investors gave Lucas Duplan, a 22-year-old Stanford graduate who moonlights as your friend&#x2019;s annoying little brother, more than $25 million in venture backing. These investors weren&#x2019;t crackpots: They included big names like Richard Branson, who posed eagerly next to Duplan&#x2019;s smooth, childish face in photos. They both grinned wide, but Branson grinned widest: <em>I&#x2019;ve found my Next Zuckerberg, you sons of bitches.</em></p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.j">Clinkle, with Duplan at the controls, was unable to deliver a single scrap of software to the public in more than a year. Instead, Duplan fired swaths of staffers while planning his corner office in a new building; other underlings quit in disgust. Company morale bottomed out at around the same time Clinkle was hacked, revealing a selfie of Duplan holding a large handful of cash. When Clinkle launched its app (far more modest than he&#x2019;d described years before), it landed with a thud.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.k">Painful as it is to watch a corporate car crash with a baby at the wheel, these disasters might be the only way the industry will learn; that, and watching actual adults succeed. Zuckerberg, to his credit, was pretty quick to cede big-boy managerial duties to business-savvy adults and stick to his strength as the social-media prophet-in-chief. But what would be more useful than studying a wave of cautionary tales is to pay attention to grand-slam exceptions&#x2014;success stories worth emulating, like that of Jan Koum and Brian Acton, who flipped their instant-messaging company WhatsApp to Facebook for almost $20 billion. The duo are 39 and 43, respectively, almost octogenarian by founder standards, yet responsible for one of the greatest software successes (and investor returns) in Silicon Valley&#x2019;s history. And there&#x2019;s a reason most people had never heard their names before their gigantic fortune: All along they&#x2019;d acted like grown-ups.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.l"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fac53655c24c6c954736/master/w_806/entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_02.jpg" alt="entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsilicon-valley-is-a-lie&amp;t=entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsilicon-valley-is-a-lie&amp;t=entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsilicon-valley-is-a-lie&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fac53655c24c6c954736%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_02.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsilicon-valley-is-a-lie&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fac53655c24c6c954736%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_02.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed h4" data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.m"><h4><strong>Myth #4: School Is for Suckers, Just Drop Out</strong></h4></div><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.n">Every year, PayPal co-founder, investor-guru, and rabid libertarian Peter Thiel awards a small group of college-age students the Thiel Fellowship, a paid offer to either drop out or forgo college entirely. In exchange, the students receive money, mentorship, and networking opportunities from Thiel as they pursue a start-up of their choice. We&#x2019;re frequently reminded of the tech titans of industry who never got a degree&#x2014;Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg are the most cited, though the fact that they&#x2019;re statistical exceptions is an aside at best. To be young in Silicon Valley is great; to be a young dropout is golden.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.o">The virtuous dropout hasn&#x2019;t just made college seem optional for many aspiring barons&#x2014;formal education is now excoriated in Silicon Valley as an obsolete system dreamed up by people who&#x2019;d never heard of photo filters or Snapchat. Mix this cynicism with the libertarian streak many tech entrepreneurs carry already and you&#x2019;ve got yourself a legit anti-education movement.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.p">And for what? There&#x2019;s no evidence that avoiding a conventional education today grants business success tomorrow. The gifted few who end up dropping out and changing tech history would have probably changed tech history anyway&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t learn start-up greatness by refusing to learn in a college classroom. And given that most start-ups fail, do we want an appreciable segment of bright young people gambling so heavily on being the next Zuck? More important, do we want an economy of CEOs who never had to learn to get along with their dorm-mates? Who never had the opportunity to grow up and figure out how to be a human being functioning in society? Who went straight from a bedroom in their parents&#x2019; house to an incubator that paid for their meals? It&#x2019;s no wonder tech has an antisocial rep.</p><div class="embed h4" data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.q"><h4><strong>Myth #5: Coding Is the Key to the Kingdom</strong></h4></div><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.r">It&#x2019;s a dictate, a mantra. You hear it when you lift your Fitbit-ed wrist to your head and cup your hand to your ear: <em>Go west, young man, and learn to code.</em> It&#x2019;s only natural that Silicon Valley&#x2019;s thought sherpas have come to fetishize the skills of the coder. For those inside the Silicon bubble, knowing a computer language is as much a lifestyle as it is a LinkedIn bullet point&#x2014;and moreover, it&#x2019;s salvation. (Just one illustrative anecdote: Last summer, a &quot;compassionate entrepreneur&quot;/aspiring Henry Higgins launched a campaign to teach coding skills in an effort to eradicate the homelessness problem in San Francisco. That&#x2019;s how entrenched the belief is.)</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.s">According to Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape, &quot;Learning to code is the single best thing anyone can do to get the most out of the amazing future in front of us.&quot; That&#x2019;s one hell of a statement at a time when more than 30 million American adults can&#x2019;t read well. Deep-pocketed technologists are pushing for coding to become not just part of career training but a core curriculum item, alongside history and biology. Code.org, a nonprofit supported by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, has racked up millions in donations from the infamously philanthropy-averse denizens of the Valley.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.t">Computer fluency should be mandatory for every American student. We&#x2019;d be well served by growing the number of students&#x2014;particularly young girls&#x2014;with access to a robust computer-science curriculum. But convincing ourselves that being able to write JavaScript is not just the best skill to have but the <em>only</em> true skill worth having is to buy into the Valley worldview a thousand times over. When we accept it as a badge of virtue, we give Silicon Valley hubris a stamp of validation.</p><div class="embed h4" data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.u"><h4><strong>Myth #6: San Francisco Is the (Moral, Cultural, Financial) Center of the Universe</strong></h4></div><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.v">Boomtown San Francisco has an ego that makes New York and Los Angeles blush. The Bay Area&#x2014;at least for those who consider skyrocketing rents a point of pride&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t just the best place to be, but the <em>only</em> place to be. It&#x2019;s a simple argument: Technological innovation is the only innovation worth a damn today, and all of it is happening in or around San Francisco.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.w">In 2014, Y Combinator czar Sam Altman said, &quot;All the growth in the economy right now is in tech, and the only thing that is working is tech.&quot; This claim has been thoroughly debunked, but it underscored a greater belief in what matters in America and what doesn&#x2019;t. The previous year, Chamath Palihapitiya, a major start-up investor and part owner of the Golden State Warriors, made his SF-centrism explicit:</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.x">&quot;The center of power is here, make no mistake.... It&#x2019;s becoming excruciatingly, obviously clear to everyone else that where value is created is no longer in New York, it&#x2019;s no longer in Washington, it&#x2019;s no longer in L.A. It&#x2019;s in San Francisco and the Bay Area.... Because markets value meaningful events, markets discount meaningless events. And so the functional value of the government is effectively discounted to zero.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.y">In other words, why haven&#x2019;t we just replaced Congress with an app? What if the same minds that brought you Instagram were trusted with HealthCare.gov? Value in this case doesn&#x2019;t just mean dollars; this is a declaration that all human activity of worth is transpiring within one segment of one industry in a single geographic sliver of the country.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.z">Balaji Srinivasan, an Andreessen Horowitz ecutive (who&#x2019;s also basically a secessionist-movement leader), famously calls everything outside Silicon Valley the &quot;Paper Belt.&quot; It&#x2019;s a powerful rhetorical weapon for the delusional barons who live there; if we criticize them, it&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;re from the Paper Belt, it&#x2019;s because we don&#x2019;t &quot;get&quot; tech. If we undermine them, we&#x2019;re undermining the country&#x2019;s last remaining font of Value.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.10">What everyone forgets, though, is what Paul Graham, of all people, made very clear back in 2006: Silicon Valley could&#x2019;ve happened anywhere. There&#x2019;s nothing particularly special about the Bay Area, its adjacent regions, or anyone who lives there. &quot;I think you only need two kinds of people to create a technology hub,&quot; Graham explained: &quot;rich people and nerds.&quot; The Silicon Valley nexus isn&#x2019;t Rome, or even Atlantic City. It&#x2019;s just a place that hosts a glut of coders and people with enough money to fund even the worst ideas&#x2014;most of which rely on the fundamental conviction that technology&#x2019;s greatest power is that it can put us anywhere virtually, without the need to be there physically. Without the need to all gather in one blessed metropolitan area.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.11">Thankfully, start-up incubators in other American cities are gaining ground. Cities like Baltimore&#x2014;former industrial powerhouses now left with vast tracts of abandoned real estate and a low cost of living&#x2014;are ripe for a techno rebirth. Groups like ETC and Betamore (in Baltimore) are helping founders get started in cities that need them rather than loathe them.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.12"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fac53655c24c6c954739/master/w_806/entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_03.jpg" alt="entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsilicon-valley-is-a-lie&amp;t=entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsilicon-valley-is-a-lie&amp;t=entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsilicon-valley-is-a-lie&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fac53655c24c6c954739%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_03.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsilicon-valley-is-a-lie&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fac53655c24c6c954739%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_03.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-06-silicon-valley_03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed h4" data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.13"><h4><strong>Myth #7: Silicon Valley Is Saving the World</strong></h4></div><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.14">Two years ago, an online list of &quot;57 start-up lessons&quot; made its way through the coder community, bolstered by a co-sign from Paul Graham. &quot;Wow, is this list good,&quot; he commented. &quot;It has the kind of resonance you only get when you&#x2019;re writing from a lot of hard experience.&quot; Among the platitudinous menagerie was this gem: &quot;If it doesn&#x2019;t augment the human condition for a huge number of people in a meaningful way, it&#x2019;s not worth doing.&quot; In a mission statement published on Andreessen Horowitz&#x2019;s website, Marc Andreessen claimed he was &quot;looking for the companies who are going to be the big winners because they are going to cause a fundamental change in the world.&quot; The firm&#x2019;s portfolio includes Ringly (maker of rings that light up when your phone does something), Teespring (custom T-shirts), DogVacay (pet-sitters on demand), and Hem (the zombified corpse of the furniture store Fab.com). Last year, wealthy Facebook alum Justin Rosenstein told a packed audience at TechCrunch Disrupt, &quot;We in this room, we in technology, have a greater capacity to change the world than the kings and presidents of even a hundred years ago.&quot; No one laughed, even though Rosenstein&#x2019;s company, Asana, sells instant-messaging software.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.15">This isn&#x2019;t just a matter of preening guys in fleece vests building giant companies predicated on their own personal annoyances. It&#x2019;s wasteful and genuinely harmful to have so many people working on such trivial projects (Clinkle and fucking Yo) under the auspices of world-historical greatness. At one point recently, there were four separate on-demand laundry services operating in San Francisco, each no doubt staffed by smart young people who thought they were carving out a place of small software greatness. And yet for every laundry app, there <em>are</em> smart people doing smart, valuable things: Among the most recent batch of Y Combinator start-ups featured during March&#x2019;s &quot;Demo Day&quot; were Diassess (twenty-minute HIV tests), Standard Cyborg (3D-printed limbs), and Atomwise (using supercomputing to develop new medical compounds). Those start-ups just happen to be sharing desk space at the incubator with &quot;world changers&quot; like Lumi (easy logo printing) and Underground Cellar (&quot;curated, limited-edition wines with a twist&quot;).</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.16">What makes the pervading mythologies so frustrating is the smug certainty of Silicon Valley that its contributions to society are more important than every other industry&#x2019;s. It&#x2019;s not that we can&#x2019;t deal with assholes in our national midst (there&#x2019;s no innovating our way out of that); it&#x2019;s that no prior cohort of rich pricks have fooled themselves, and the rest of us, so thoroughly. And what a drag. At its best, Silicon Valley creates things we can&#x2019;t fathom living without, the toys that become staples that become culture itself. Businesses like Uber and Airbnb that might&#x2019;ve seemed like fads a decade ago are now powerhouse companies<a href="silicon-valley-is-a-lie#footnote1">*</a> that provide thousands with stable, high-paying jobs.</p><p data-reactid=".wvp632lce8.1.1.0.0.4.17">The reason we&#x2019;re calling out Silicon Valley&#x2019;s lies is a selfish one: We&#x2019;re tired of feeling conflicted about the moral implications of summoning an on-demand cab, or wondering if our social network of choice is run by a suite of guys who look like Mr. Monopoly. We just want these places to act like the capitalist free-market solutions they are, not humanity&#x2019;s saviors. Palo Alto just isn&#x2019;t Renaissance Florence, and that&#x2019;s perfectly fine. Wall Street is easily more villainous than the Valley, but it harbors no delusions of heroism. Our national contempt for finance and banking acts as a sort of check on Wall Street&#x2019;s actions&#x2014;a way of keeping J.P. Morgan from literally torching small towns and selling the ashes. And that&#x2019;s all we need with Silicon Valley: a watchful eye and an intelligent wariness of any self-satisfied bullshit.
