Pray for a blizzard during the Super Bowl. What is it about the prospect of playing the Super Bowl in cold weather that turns so many of the NFL&amp;#x2019;s tough guys into such, well, pussies? Sunday&amp;#x2019;s game will be played outside in North Jersey, and when TMZ recently asked Green Bay Packers legend Paul Hornung about it, he growled: &amp;#x201C;I hope it snows like a bitch. Then they&amp;#x2019;ll figure it out.&amp;#x201D; I, too, hope it snows like a bitch, but not because that&amp;#x2019;ll learn&amp;#x2019;em. [Snort/adjust nutsack.] No: because it&amp;#x2019;d be awesome. It&amp;#x2019;d look killer on TV, it&amp;#x2019;d make the game all wacky, and if it forces even one corporate shill to wimp out and stay home, high five! Oh, who are we kidding—it&amp;#x2019;s gonna be fifty-three degrees and sunny. Thanks for nothing, God.—DEVIN GORDON\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestMORE PUPPIES.jpg\u000A\u000A2. Or watch the other big game: Puppy Bowl X. It&amp;#x2019;s a scientific fact* that puppies make everything better. Proof: Animal Planet&amp;#x2019;s furry Super Bowl alternative, the Puppy Bowl. Now in its tenth year, the Puppy Bowl will host 66 puppies competing to be named Most Valuable Player Puppy. We spoke with the official Puppy Bowl referee Dan Schachner to learn the rules of the game. (*Based on this.)\u000A\u000A GQ: What&amp;#x2019;s the ref&amp;#x2019;s job during Puppy Bowl?\u000A\u000A Dan Schachner: The ref&amp;#x2019;s job is twofold: organize the chaos that is what happens when you put several dozen puppies on the field at any given time. And secondly, to call infractions as I see them to sort of keep that order going. If I see penalties that put puppies in danger or are just plain wrong, I&amp;#x2019;m going to call them and let the world know that we will not tolerate things like illegal napping or excessive snacking, or things of that nature.\u000A\u000A So, what are the rules?\u000A\u000A The rules are really simple: drag one chew toy into the end zone, by a puppy, and that constitutes a touchdown. Now, it doesn&amp;#x2019;t matter which chew toy, doesn&amp;#x2019;t matter which puppy, doesn&amp;#x2019;t matter which end zone—a touchdown is a touchdown. And at the end of the game, it&amp;#x2019;s every pup for himself. It&amp;#x2019;s the puppy that scores the most touchdowns that will be awarded MVP. There&amp;#x2019;s no teams.\u000A\u000A And penalties?\u000A\u000A There&amp;#x2019;s two sets of penalties: ones that have counterparts in the human league—like, &amp;#x201C;ineligible receiver downfield&amp;#x201D; is a famous NFL term used as a penalty; we have &amp;#x201C;ineligible retriever downfield.&amp;#x201D; The NFL might have &amp;#x201C;pass interference,&amp;#x201D; we don&amp;#x2019;t have that, we have &amp;#x201C;paws interference.&amp;#x201D; Illegal formation is one that you&amp;#x2019;ll see a lot of in the NFL, we have illegal furmation. But then we have a whole set of penalties that are unique to Puppy Bowl that you&amp;#x2019;ll never see in any other game…&amp;#x201C;watering of the lawn,&amp;#x201D; which if you use your imagination, you can imagine how that happens.\u000A\u000A Illegal furmation?\u000A\u000A Well, as crazy as it sounds, we&amp;#x2019;re really trying to have some semblance of order. Illegal formation, of course, happens when the players are not properly lined up at the line of scrimmage, and maybe the quarterback has dropped back too far, or the snapper is not lined up properly. So with puppies, it&amp;#x2019;s simply a matter of, if there are more puppies off the field than there are on the field. And believe me, that happens more often that you think with the puppies. They have no idea where the actual boundaries of the field are.\u000A\u000AWhat makes Puppy Bowl better than the actual Super Bowl?\u000A\u000A &amp;#xE2;&amp;#x80;&amp;#x8B;We have kittens at halftime. As much as we love whatever the human league offers as their halftime entertainment, I don&amp;#x2019;t think anyone could compete with Keyboard Cat. And we have penguin cheerleaders—a lot of people think penguins are stoic and don&amp;#x2019;t do too much, but wait until you see them on the field. But I can tell you—from experience, penguins do not enjoy when you try to put a cheerleading outfit on them.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestbklyn 99.jpg\u000A\u000A3. Don&amp;#x2019;t change the channel! Celebrate your team&amp;#x2019;s win—or mourn their loss—with the cast of Brooklyn Nine-Nine. In the grand TV tradition of post-game Super Bowl specials, Brooklyn Nine-Nine will air a guest star-filled episode of the newly Golden Globe-winning cop comedy. We rang up Melissa Fumero—aka, Detective Amy Santiago, the uptight rule-follower to Andy Samberg&amp;#x2019;s how-does-he-still-have-a-job Jake Peralta—about the special installment.\u000A\u000A GQ: Congratulations on the Golden Globe! What was that night like?\u000A\u000A Melissa Fumero: So surreal. It&amp;#x2019;s still surreal—like, I still will look at pictures on my phone from that night and be like, Oh, yes, that really happened. It was just really shocking, in the best way. … As soon as we went backstage, [my emotions] all started to really come out—it was just slobbery. Like, it wasn&amp;#x2019;t cute. Just a mess. And Alfonso Cuar&amp;#xF3;n was walking back after his win, and he pointed at me and was like, &amp;#x201C;You! Congratulations!&amp;#x201D; And then I feel these hands on my shoulders and I look up and, like, Ben Affleck is freakin&amp;#x2019; holding me and going, &amp;#x201C;Are you OK? Congratulations. Are you alright?!&amp;#x201D; And then he started laughing and walked away. And then Aaron Paul was there, and he was like, &amp;#x201C;Are you OK?&amp;#x201D; And I was like, Oh my God, famous people, please stop talking to me! You&amp;#x2019;re making it worse!\u000A\u000A Any secrets you can spill about the special Super Bowl episode?\u000A\u000A We have awesome guest stars, like Joe Theismann. And Fred Armisen comes back, playing the same character from the pilot. He and Andy dance and sing and it is amazing. I was literally sweating, again, trying not to laugh, watching the two of them be complete fools and it was fantastic. There&amp;#x2019;s action, there&amp;#x2019;s a great storyline, it&amp;#x2019;s a big, fun, flashy episode and hopefully, after the Super Bowl, when people are drunk and still have their TV on, even if the sound isn&amp;#x2019;t on, visually, they&amp;#x2019;ll just laugh at it, and be like, What&amp;#x2019;s this?\u000A\u000A Brooklyn Nine-Nine** is a sort-of office comedy—do you think you&amp;#x2019;d get along with Detective Amy Santiago if you were cubicle buddies?\u000A\u000A **Ugh, I don&amp;#x2019;t think so. I mean—maybe. Like, I&amp;#x2019;m very laidback, and Amy is very type-A and a little uptight. I think I would probably roll my eyes at Amy a lot, but Amy&amp;#x2019;s also like very kind and loyal—I think that would kind of make me have a soft spot for her, because she is a good person. She just fails a lot. I would probably be friendly with her and make fun of her behind of her back a little bit. And probably to her face, too.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestBest Night Ever.jpg\u000A\u000A4. Meet the drunk lovechild of The Hangover and Bridesmaids: Best Night Ever. Best Night Ever has a predictable-sounding premise: four girls head to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party and things get crazy. Not predictable? The kidnapping, the peeing on things, the photo of a guy getting Eiffel Tower&amp;#x2019;d. (NSF-workplace-Google-imaging, people.) Brought to you by the guys who created all of those Scary Movie parodies—and a relatively unknown cast of insanely fearless actresses who go where no bro-y bachelor party flick has ever even dared to go—it&amp;#x2019;s raunchy, horrifying, cringe-worthy. Also, really, really funny.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A5. Learn _Who the Fk is Arthur Fogel? _(Stay for the behind-the-scenes looks at some of music&amp;#x2019;s insanely huge tours.)** This ninety-minute doc premieres on EPIX Wednesday and, yes, by the end you will know who the f*ck Arthur Fogel is. (He&amp;#x2019;s the CEO of Global Touring at Live Nation and he&amp;#x2019;s, like, really good at his job.) You&amp;#x2019;ll also get a look at what goes down behind-the-scenes to produce spectacles like U2&amp;#x2019;s 360 tour, and, of course, engineer them as moneymaking successes.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A6. Get wrapped up in Quilt. Particularly the cheerfully retro-sounding track below—think of &amp;#x201C;Tired &amp; Buttered&amp;#x201D; like &amp;#x2018;60s-psychedelic-lite—from the pop-rock trio&amp;#x2019;s sophomore album, Held In Splendor.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest12OBoys.jpeg\u000A\u000A7. Feel like a cranky old person by watching 12 O&amp;#x2019;Clock Boys. Meet Pug: a baby-faced Baltimore teen who wants to be part of 12 O&amp;#x2019;Clock Boys—a dirt-bike pack that illegally weaves, revs, and pop-wheelies throughout the city streets—and the subject of filmmaker Lotfy Nathan&amp;#x2019;s doc that opens in theaters Friday. It&amp;#x2019;s tough not to feel torn about the 12 O&amp;#x2019;Clock Boys: on the one hand, they pull off amazing stunts, share a sense of brotherhood, and provide much-needed, adrenaline-fueled stress release. On the other, they&amp;#x2019;re doing something incredibly dangerous. Same goes for Pug. He&amp;#x2019;s adorable—though his growing teen boy arrogance and disregard for his own safety is as off-putting as it is touching. Listen to your mother! Don&amp;#x2019;t steal that bike! WEAR A HELMET! Or, you know, maybe we&amp;#x2019;re just cranky old folks. Either way, it&amp;#x2019;s a mesmerizing inside look at a world we&amp;#x2019;ve never before seen, and reason enough to watch.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestWhen Blackness.jpeg\u000A\u000A8. Meet a dad who does bad things: Hayes Fanning. It&amp;#x2019;s easy to feel sorry for Fanning—the protagonist of Michael Grant Jaffe&amp;#x2019;s new novel, When Blackness Was a Virtue, available tomorrow. He&amp;#x2019;s a loving single dad, works at a struggling greeting-card company, and has a pretty terrible ex-wife. He also makes a sweet-sounding grandma bleed in the first three pages of the book, as a debt collector for a mysterious bookie. The secret violent work is how he makes ends meet…which sort of makes it all worth it. Sort of.",

Proof: Animal Planet&amp;#x2019;s furry Super Bowl alternative, the Puppy Bowl. Now in its tenth year, the Puppy Bowl will host 66 puppies competing to be named Most Valuable Player Puppy. We spoke with the official Puppy Bowl referee Dan Schachner to learn the rules of the game. <em>(*Based on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cute+puppies&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=119&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WZHiUuiKqtsASLrIGQAw&amp;ved=0CC4QsAQ&amp;biw=1363&amp;bih=885">this</a>.)</em></p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>GQ: What&amp;#x2019;s the ref&amp;#x2019;s job during Puppy Bowl?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.8"> <strong>Dan Schachner: </strong>The ref&amp;#x2019;s job is twofold: organize the chaos that is what happens when you put several dozen puppies on the field at any given time. And secondly, to call infractions as I see them to sort of keep that order going. If I see penalties that put puppies in danger or are just plain wrong, I&amp;#x2019;m going to call them and let the world know that we will not tolerate things like illegal napping or excessive snacking, or things of that nature.</p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.9"> <strong>So, what are the rules?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.a"> The rules are really simple: drag one chew toy into the end zone, by a puppy, and that constitutes a touchdown. Now, it doesn&amp;#x2019;t matter which chew toy, doesn&amp;#x2019;t matter which puppy, doesn&amp;#x2019;t matter which end zone&#x2014;a touchdown is a touchdown. And at the end of the game, it&amp;#x2019;s every pup for himself. It&amp;#x2019;s the puppy that scores the most touchdowns that will be awarded MVP. There&amp;#x2019;s no teams.</p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.b"> <strong>And penalties?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.c"> There&amp;#x2019;s two sets of penalties: ones that have counterparts in the human league&#x2014;like, &amp;#x201C;ineligible receiver downfield&amp;#x201D; is a famous NFL term used as a penalty; we have &amp;#x201C;ineligible retriever downfield.&amp;#x201D; The NFL might have &amp;#x201C;pass interference,&amp;#x201D; we don&amp;#x2019;t have that, we have &amp;#x201C;paws interference.&amp;#x201D; Illegal formation is one that you&amp;#x2019;ll see a lot of in the NFL, we have illegal furmation. But then we have a whole set of penalties that are unique to Puppy Bowl that you&amp;#x2019;ll never see in any other game&#x2026;&amp;#x201C;watering of the lawn,&amp;#x201D; which if you use your imagination, you can imagine how that happens.</p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.d"> <strong>Illegal <em>fur</em>mation?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.e"> Well, as crazy as it sounds, we&amp;#x2019;re really trying to have some semblance of order. Illegal formation, of course, happens when the players are not properly lined up at the line of scrimmage, and maybe the quarterback has dropped back too far, or the snapper is not lined up properly. So with puppies, it&amp;#x2019;s simply a matter of, if there are more puppies off the field than there are on the field. And believe me, that happens more often that you think with the puppies. They have no idea where the actual boundaries of the field are.</p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>What makes Puppy Bowl better than the actual Super Bowl?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong> &amp;#xE2;&amp;#x80;&amp;#x8B;</strong>We have kittens at halftime. As much as we love whatever the human league offers as their halftime entertainment, I don&amp;#x2019;t think anyone could compete with Keyboard Cat. And we have penguin cheerleaders&#x2014;a lot of people think penguins are stoic and don&amp;#x2019;t do too much, but wait until you see them on the field. But I can tell you&#x2014;from experience, penguins do not enjoy when you try to put a cheerleading outfit on them.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.h"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.i"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55828a3ee52bc4b477a97662/master/w_925/blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-bklyn%2099-thumb-635x439-250668.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-bklyn%2099-thumb-635x439-250668.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpuppy-bowl-rules-referee&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-bklyn%252099-thumb-635x439-250668.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpuppy-bowl-rules-referee&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-bklyn%252099-thumb-635x439-250668.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpuppy-bowl-rules-referee&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828a3ee52bc4b477a97662%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-bklyn%252099-thumb-635x439-250668.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-bklyn%252099-thumb-635x439-250668.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpuppy-bowl-rules-referee&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828a3ee52bc4b477a97662%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-bklyn%252099-thumb-635x439-250668.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-bklyn%252099-thumb-635x439-250668.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>bklyn 99.jpg</p></span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.j"><a href="puppy-bowl-rules-referee"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Don&amp;#x2019;t change the channel!

Are you alright?!&amp;#x201D; And then he started laughing and walked away. And then Aaron Paul was there, and he was like, &amp;#x201C;Are you OK?&amp;#x201D; And I was like, Oh my God, famous people, please stop talking to me!

I was literally sweating, again, trying not to laugh, watching the two of them be complete fools and it was fantastic. There&amp;#x2019;s action, there&amp;#x2019;s a great storyline, it&amp;#x2019;s a big, fun, flashy episode and hopefully, after the Super Bowl, when people are drunk and still have their TV on, even if the sound isn&amp;#x2019;t on, visually, they&amp;#x2019;ll just laugh at it, and be like, What&amp;#x2019;s this?</p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.o"> <strong><em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em></strong>** is a sort-of office comedy&#x2014;do you think you&amp;#x2019;d get along with Detective Amy Santiago if you were cubicle buddies?</p><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.p"> **Ugh, I don&amp;#x2019;t think so. I mean&#x2014;maybe. Like, I&amp;#x2019;m very laidback, and Amy is very type-A and a little uptight. I think I would probably roll my eyes at Amy a lot, but Amy&amp;#x2019;s also like very kind and loyal&#x2014;I think that would kind of make me have a soft spot for her, because she is a good person. She just fails a lot. I would probably be friendly with her and make fun of her behind of her back a little bit. And probably to her face, too.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.q"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.r"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55828a3e1177d66d68d523b4/master/w_925/blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-Best%20Night%20Ever-thumb-635x423-250670.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-Best%20Night%20Ever-thumb-635x423-250670.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpuppy-bowl-rules-referee&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-Best%2520Night%2520Ever-thumb-635x423-250670.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpuppy-bowl-rules-referee&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-Best%2520Night%2520Ever-thumb-635x423-250670.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpuppy-bowl-rules-referee&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828a3e1177d66d68d523b4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-Best%2520Night%2520Ever-thumb-635x423-250670.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-Best%2520Night%2520Ever-thumb-635x423-250670.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fpuppy-bowl-rules-referee&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828a3e1177d66d68d523b4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-Best%2520Night%2520Ever-thumb-635x423-250670.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2014-01-Best%2520Night%2520Ever-thumb-635x423-250670.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>Best Night Ever.jpg</p></span></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".5ddhok81z4.1.1.0.0.4.s"><a href="puppy-bowl-rules-referee"></a><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Meet the drunk lovechild of <em>The Hangover</em> and <em>Bridesmaids</em>: <em>Best Night Ever</em>.</strong> <em>Best Night Ever</em> has a predictable-sounding premise: four girls head to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party and things get crazy.

It&amp;#x2019;s tough not to feel torn about the 12 O&amp;#x2019;Clock Boys: on the one hand, they pull off amazing stunts, share a sense of brotherhood, and provide much-needed, adrenaline-fueled stress release.
