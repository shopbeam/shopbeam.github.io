  	    "articleBody": "The hamburger is a symbol of everything that makes America great. Straightforward, egalitarian, substantial, and good-natured, it is also a little bloody at times.\u000A\u000AIt may come big and ungarnished, the East Coast ideal, tender and untroubled by bones or gristle, everything you look for in a filet mignon but seldom find. It may be the West Coast model, swelling with vegetation, brimming with health and well-being, piled high with all that a seed catalog can provide. A great burger, regardless of regional differences, instills a sense of optimism and fulfillment, that all is right at the table or the counter or the woodgrain, screwed-to-the-floor, fast-food booth.\u000A\u000AAt its best, it eliminates the need for conversation or the urge to glance up at the TV over the bar. If you find yourself eating silently, eyes closed, ignoring everything around you, even the unavoidable burger-joint din, you have come upon a burger that can be pronounced a success.\u000A\u000AOf course, it must be molded by hand, artfully seared, and offered medium-rare. If that\u0027s too much to ask, not overcooked would be nice. Whose idea was it anyway that serving desiccated burgers to Americans would enable all of us to spring back to health? Excessive reliance on condiments is another alarming development, especially in the matter of ketchup, the burger Band-Aid. Ketchup is valuable only when an emergency jolt of moisture, sweetness, acidity, and flavor is required. No hamburger is inedible if you put enough ketchup on it, but no hamburger that has ketchup on it can be considered great. Mustard is a mistake, unless you\u0027re French and welcome a vinegary jolt with your food, while pickles, those subversive little sweet and sour instruments, fill me with dread. When I find pickles furtively inserted into my burger, I generally look to the heavens with a clenched fist and sob, \u0022Why?\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve always claimed I\u0027d go a long way for the right burger, and indeed I did. I traveled 23,750 miles—that\u0027s just 1,152 miles short of encircling the globe at the equator—looking for the best ones in America. I consumed more than 150,000 calories but resisted drinking a can of soda with every burger, saving more than 22,000 calories that way. I ate crazy burgers, Kobe burgers, bison burgers, longhorn burgers, ostrich burgers, onion burgers, lamb burgers, and of course, cheeseburgers. (Note that cheese goes so well with burgers that the word is assembled differently, with no space in between.) I tried fast-food burgers, and while there\u0027s a sameness to them that overwhelms any attempts at excellence, I found some mighty fine values on those dollar menus, assuming you don\u0027t mind your burgers hard and dry, like the smiles on the faces of the teenagers who take your order. I visited Burger Heaven. Actually, I went to a few places called that. I was also in burger hell, which is Milwaukee, home of the butter burger, essentially meat saturated with grease.\u000A\u000AMy goal was to find the twenty best burgers, and with apologies to all the restaurants, stands, bars, and grills I missed, I\u0027d like to believe I did well. I ate 162 burgers in ninety-three establishments. Some of them were fancified, proffering foie gras-stuffed burgers costing as much as $29. Some were dumps, with burgers hovering near a buck. At no time, despite pleas from loved ones, did I have a physician standing by. I found no correlation between price and tastiness, nor did ambience count for a great deal. A burger requires only a cook of modest accomplishments, one who knows enough to remove it from the fire before it has lost its juiciness and not to press down hard with a spatula—squishing might work with grilled cheese, but it\u0027s fatal for burgers. Waitresses who work in burger joints can have scars and tattoos, as long as they\u0027re not self-inflicted. Motorcycles are fine, provided they\u0027re not parked inside.\u000A\u000ATo be precise, I visited ninety-five places, but I didn\u0027t eat at two. In Boston, I attempted lunch at Tim\u0027s Bar and Grill, which features a huge rubber garbage pail in the dining area. The waitress was so surly (\u0022If you don\u0027t like the service, you can leave\u0022) that I walked out. Where\u0027d you find your decorator, Tim, at the sanitation department? I also undertook a 360-mile round-trip drive to Little Compton, Rhode Island, to try the burger at the legendary Commons Lunch, only to find that it had burned down.\u000A\u000AIn the course of my travels, I learned to love the bun. Bunless, a burger is merely a chopped steak, the food of mess halls and chow lines, prisons and cafeterias. The roll makes the burger, although it must not be too large or too obtrusive; a common error of steak houses, which rarely offer memorable burgers, is that they buy buns so big, fat, and tall that their burgers assume the dimensions of wedding cakes. A bun may be lightly toasted or grilled, but it is vital that it be fresh. I am also possessed of newfound respect for the onion, which is rarely esteemed. A few thin circles of mild raw onion add sweetness and crunch. Nothing else is needed on a burger, although cheese has its place.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AI took my father to a roadhouse specializing in burgers in South Miami, a decision I regretted. The parking lot was practically rubble, overgrown with weeds. He was unable to use his walker, but we finally made it into Bill &amp; Ted\u0027s Tavern with me half-lifting him and apologizing for being an inconsiderate son.\u000A\u000AWe ordered, and I\u0027ll never forget the glow when he bit into his burger after years of assisted-living cuisine. I thought the burgers were slightly overcooked, but the onion-relish-pickle package was brilliantly balanced, a condiment tour de force, and when I asked him why he was so happy, he said, \u0022I never get to eat food like this.\u0022 The burger, fare not favored by institutional nutritionists, invariably inspires affection. It brings back memories of backyard barbecues and family gatherings, and it comes in all sizes, adding to its appeal. Burgers can be as small as a couple of ounces or as large as a full pound, although it seems that whenever restaurants dish up the largest size, they feel obligated to issue warnings. (\u0022Try our new 1lb. burger…if you dare,\u0022 read the promo for the Burgerpalooza at the Jolly Trolley in Mamaroneck, New York.)\u000A\u000AThe oversize burger is a haunch of ground meat, hand-formed, upon which the diner happily gnaws. It is an exaggeration of America\u0027s plenty, the banana split of sandwiches. Smaller burgers are essentially platforms for unlimited embellishments. Piled high with extras, this breed of burger is a piñata at a birthday party, a festival miniaturized. Everybody who loves beef has a favorite burger, but hardly anybody agrees on which is best. Before heading off, I consulted food Web sites, food experts, and food writers. I was persuaded by a fellow I met at a food festival in Virginia to visit a restaurant outside Lawton, Oklahoma, that he promised had the best burger in America. I drove up from Dallas, more than 200 miles, to eat at Meers Store &amp; Restaurant, located next to a bison preserve. The menu read: \u0022All steaks &amp; hamburgers cooked to order,\u0022 and I had this conversation with my waiter:\u000A\u000AME: Medium-rare, please.\u000A\u000AHIM: All our burgers are well-done.\u000A\u000AME: The menu says they\u0027re cooked to order.\u000A\u000AHIM: That means we don\u0027t start cooking until you order it.\u000A\u000AI had a cheeseburger anyway, and it\u0027s a shame the cook had to ruin it, because the concept was a good one—a wide, flat burger with gooey cheese. I believe I\u0027ve made my feelings clear about the medium-rare burger, but if the meat is particularly lean, it should be eaten rare. A well-done burger is a badly done burger, food for the meek, and if that\u0027s the way we\u0027re going to have our burgers, then we might as well give up trying to enjoy ourselves and make green salads our national dish.\u000A\u000AAlthough I endured occasional disappointments, I never wearied of life on the hamburger highway. No matter how many burgers I ate, and I believe my daily consumption never exceeded six, no matter how full of chopped beef I was at the end of a long but satisfying day, I always woke up the next morning eager to begin again.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASirloin Burger, Le TubHollywood, FL\u000A\u000AThis is a dream of a dump, located on the site of a former Sunoco gas station. Outside there\u0027s assorted porcelain—toilets, sinks, tubs. Most have plants in them, and a lot of the plants look dead. Inside is a pool table, a jukebox, and tables reminiscent of the ones at highway rest stops. The view is magnificent, the Intracoastal Waterway at its broadest and most dramatic. Le Tub doesn\u0027t take credit cards, and it has signs everywhere reinforcing that rule. I\u0027m surprised anybody who eats here qualifies for a credit card.\u000A\u000AThe menu is big, and the food isn\u0027t bad, except for the Sirloin Burger, which is magnificent. It\u0027s slowly seared on an indoor grill, crusty on the outside, juicy inside, always perfectly cooked. At eight to ten ounces, it\u0027s ideal big-burger size, and it\u0027s shaped like a pincushion, with sloping sides, which means you get a nice gradient of doneness. The bun has a few poppy seeds and looks like a kaiser roll, but it\u0027s smaller and softer. It\u0027s just right for enveloping the meat, which is judiciously seasoned and spiced, mostly with salt and pepper, I suspect. That\u0027s all it needs. No cheese or condiments required.\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t understand how this spot came to have the best burger in America, but it does. Regardless of where I am in South Florida, I always make my way here for lunch. I sit at the bar and watch yachts that cost millions drift by, draped with women who cost more, and I think to myself how lucky I am to be at Le Tub.\u000A\u000ALuger Burger, Peter Luger Steak HouseBrooklyn, NY\u000A\u000AThe legendary Peter Luger is celebrated for its porterhouse, which is buttered, seared, and sliced. But consider this: Its burger (available only at lunch) may be even better than the steak.\u000A\u000AAt first glance, the roll seems too large, as it is at most steak houses. It isn\u0027t. The half pound of beef, so charred on the outside it appears overcooked, isn\u0027t. The magnificent roll settles beautifully around the succulent, juicy burger, assembled from prime aged-porterhouse trimmings and prime chuck. You can get raw onion. Don\u0027t. It comes with steak sauce. Superfluous. You can have cheese. Unnecessary. There\u0027s a bacon option. Hold on. The bacon, three-eighths-inch thick, slightly blackened, smoky, and chewy-tender, complements the beef the way mustard accents a hot dog. I can never decide: With bacon? Without bacon? Both ways are just right. The fries are among the best in America. One warning: While you\u0027re waiting for your burger to arrive, try not to eat the entire basket of irresistible bread.\u000A\u000ANot Just a Burger, Spiced Pear Restaurant at the Chanler HotelNewport, RI\u000A\u000AThis burger doesn\u0027t taste like a burger. It\u0027s more in the North Carolina pulled-pork family, even though it\u0027s all Kobe beef. (Kobe beef has a lot of the qualities of pork—it\u0027s soft and sweet.) Chef Richard Hamilton, who has big-time talent, makes the best high-concept burger in America. His roll, which is a bit towering, worried me at first, but it flattened beautifully and didn\u0027t get in the way. The burger, which consists of barbecued Kobe brisket surrounded by chopped Kobe beef, is topped with enormously complex but not overpowering coleslaw and sits on a tomato-onion jam that\u0027s sort of a cross between ketchup and barbecue sauce.\u000A\u000AThe twelve-ounce creation isn\u0027t so much a juicy burger as a mouthwatering, heart-stopping, wildly rich chopped-beef sandwich every bit as satisfying as the best sandwich you\u0027ve ever eaten down south. It\u0027s a burger breakthrough, and the accompanying garlic-basil-Parmesan potato chips are awe-inspiring.\u000A\u000ARouge Burger, RougePhiladelphia. PA\u000A\u000AThe clientele appears to consist primarily of aging men of means, each one accompanied by an Eastern European model/actress. (Who knew that white slavery lived on in stuffy old Philadelphia?) Do these people care that they\u0027re eating the best cheeseburger in America? Rouge is so chic I\u0027m surprised that anybody pays attention to the food. I\u0027m sure they admire the staff, all in black. They probably enjoy sitting outside, right on Rittenhouse Square. Back when I was growing up in the city, outdoor dining didn\u0027t exist.\u000A\u000AHow is a simple, plump cheeseburger able to compete with all this stylishness? The Rouge Burger does just fine. The aged Gruyère cheese is strong, nutty, and pungent. The caramelized onion is judiciously applied. The bread is toasted brioche. The fries are good. The well-salted sirloin is very lean, so it\u0027s best ordered rare. I could swear the hostess, to stand out from her minions, was wearing pink pajamas, but maybe I was dizzy with pleasure from dining at Rouge and encountering a Philadelphia I never knew.\u000A\u000AKobe Sliders, Barclay PrimePhiladelphia, PA\u000A\u000AA slider is the small and rather grotesque (but nonetheless tasty) burger bagged by the bunch at White Castle. The meat in a genuine slider is square, steam-fried, overdone, and punctured with tiny holes, as though it had been attacked by a vampire. Hamburgers on naval vessels are sometimes called sliders. All in all, sliders aren\u0027t esteemed in the gastronomic firmament.\u000A\u000AAt Barclay Prime, a new steak house, the small burgers are inexplicably referred to as sliders, but they\u0027re not sliders at all. They\u0027re a mighty three inches tall. Each is made with two ounces of Kobe beef, and they come two to an order, on miniature, exceptionally buttery brioche buns. One is topped with sliced tomato and marinated shallots, the other with caramelized onion and Gruyère. They may be the most succulent burgers in America, and they\u0027re automatically prepared medium-rare. I asked our waiter why a steak house would have a need for sliders, and he replied proudly, \u0022They\u0027re like little protein appetizers. It\u0027s amazing how perfectly they get the palate ready for a big steak.\u0022\u000A\u000ACalifornia Burger, Houston\u0027sSanta Monica, CA\u000A\u000AWhen you figure how many millions of burgers emerge from chain-restaurant kitchens, it\u0027s not surprising that one of them gets it right. Houston\u0027s, a big, bustling, commercial spot, nails its California Burger.\u000A\u000AThis burger had no flaws. Zero. The roll: soft and sweet, almost like brioche. The meat: coarsely ground and flavorful. The red onion: mild and crunchy. The cheese: fully melted Monterey Jack. The condiment: a touch of mustard-honey dressing. Avocado and arugula are another great touch. Houston\u0027s California Burger is a rainbow of colors, and it\u0027s comforting, perfect for soothing Santa Monica working stiffs after a hard morning at the macramé shop. And talk about burger engineering. I asked the manager about the sliver of greenery under the burger, and he said it was cabbage, put there to avoid untoward sogginess at the base of the bun.\u000A\u000ABuckhorn Burger, BuckhornSan Antonio, NM\u000A\u000ANo burger has bigger flavors than the legendary New Mexico green-chili cheeseburger. Basically, it\u0027s too much of everything on a bun: ground beef, green chilies, mustard, tomato, lettuce, chopped onion, and pickle. Such a combination makes no culinary sense, but at Buckhorn, which makes the best green-chili cheeseburgers in a tiny town devoted to little else, the result is spectacularly tasty and eminently coherent. The too strong onions, hot-pungent chilies, and potent mustard all battle to a spectacular draw. The cheese is the binder and the pickle the crunchy refresher, while the lettuce and tomato hang on for dear life and the coarsely ground beef acts as a solid, sensible underpinning.\u000A\u000ABuckhorn tavern, which naturally calls its green-chili cheeseburger a Buckhorn Burger, offers a great mouthful of hot, sweet, juicy, chewy flavors. It\u0027s the ultimate in a burger with a burn.\u000A\u000AHamburger, Miller\u0027s BarDearborn, MI\u000A\u000AMiller\u0027s is a blockhouse of a bar, gloomy outside and not much better inside. It appears to be a place where people vanish and don\u0027t reappear for days, but locals don\u0027t come here to drink. The day I visited, everybody was bellied up to the bar, eating burgers.\u000A\u000AThey\u0027re made from ground round, which is lean and usually flavorless. Here it\u0027s been used for burgers since the \u002750s, so I was willing to try one, figuring Miller\u0027s might know something I didn\u0027t. I ended up eating three. I ordered the first medium-rare, and it was very good, made from the juiciest round I\u0027ve ever tasted. I ordered the second rare, and it was sensational. The cheeseburger, topped with Velveeta, a variation on American cheese, was darned good, too. When I asked my waitress what made the burger so special, she suggested it might be the well-seasoned grill, which had been replaced only once in the fifteen years she\u0027d worked there. Miller\u0027s has no menu, no tomatoes, no lettuce, no plates, no utensils, and no check—it\u0027s all on the honor system. When I asked the bartender to explain the fortress-like look, he told me with a straight face that cars speeding down Michigan Avenue were always crashing into the building, so the owners decided to make it impregnable.\u000A\u000ACheeseburger, Burger Joint, le Parker Meridien HotelNew York City\u000A\u000AThis spot is supposed to look like a small-town \u002750s burger hangout, but it doesn\u0027t. It looks like a small-town \u002750s pizza hangout. (Burger joints had more chrome.) Still, it\u0027s masterfully geeky, with hideous fake-wood paneling. I thought a particularly nice touch was a Christmas wreath in June. The burgers, however they\u0027re ordered, will have you dancing the jitterbug. The day I stopped in, a hotel chef by the name of Rudi—the name was stitched on his fancy chef\u0027s whites—was cooking, and he got them exactly right. The plain burger on an Arnold bun was the essence of classic simplicity. The cheeseburger with the works—tomato, lettuce, onion, pickle, ketchup, mayo, and mustard—was even better, especially when the counterman didn\u0027t overdo the mustard-mayo- ketchup amalgam. (Very few restaurants leave the vital job of accessorizing to customers.) The burger joint has quickly become a Manhattan icon, where persons of all economic stations gather to eat in peace. Or maybe it\u0027s more like a jungle watering hole, where the animals wait until they\u0027ve departed before they start tearing one another apart.\u000A\u000ANumber Five, Keller\u0027s Drive-inDallas, TX\u000A\u000AThe lady in the red Lexus that was parked alongside me leaned out the window and said, \u0022If you come here with a friend who has a convertible, you can sit all night. It\u0027s better than going to a nice restaurant.\u0022 Keller\u0027s, out on Northwest Highway, is the best drive-in I\u0027ve ever seen, and I try not to miss many. Flash your lights and out come the carhops, who aren\u0027t dolled up and aren\u0027t on roller skates, although they will call you \u0022sweetie.\u0022 They\u0027re also strong enough to lug cases of beer out to waiting cars. (Not many restaurants specialize in beer by the case.)\u000A\u000AKeller\u0027s is filled with guys hanging out. They sit on the tailgates of their pickups, feet up on coolers. The burger of choice is the Number Five, made exactly the way hamburgers were back when drive-ins first appeared, about a half-century ago. At $2.38, it\u0027s not priced a whole lot more than it would have been back then. The Number Five includes two beef patties, shredded lettuce, tomato, American cheese, and a Thousand Island–style \u0022special sauce\u0022 on a soft grilled poppy-seed role. The meat\u0027s overcooked, but that doesn\u0027t diminish the nostalgia, maybe the best in the burger world. Keller\u0027s even has a galvanized tin roof to protect cars. I suggested to my waitress, Lana, that it probably sounded awfully loud when it rained. \u0022It\u0027s not so bad,\u0022 she replied, \u0022but you should hear it when it hails.\u0022\u000A\u000AGrilled Bistro Burger, Bistro Don GiovanniNapa, CA\u000A\u000AAlthough this supremely cute spot does everything skillfully, I don\u0027t recommend ordering your burger any which way but plain. It\u0027s just too good to dress up with grilled onion or cheese or garlic-mayonnaise. The meat is chuck, and the roll a subdued version of focaccia, which is bread brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with salt. The burger is perfectly cooked on an indoor mesquite grill, and not much food is more delicious than that. Sure, you can charcoal-grill at home, but then you have to worry about famished neighbors climbing over your fence.\u000A\u000AHamburger, Bobcat BiteSante Fe, NM\u000A\u000AAlthough Bobcat Bite is famous for its green-chili cheeseburger, its best burger comes unadorned and is a mix of chuck and sirloin, the perfect blend. My admiration for this burger may also have been elevated by the tiny restaurant\u0027s unsurpassed ambience. It stands between the Jemez Mountains and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which glow red when reflecting the setting sun. While I was waiting for a table, some kindly locals pointed out the high-desert flora to me. Or maybe it was the fauna. I think one is meat, the other condiments.\u000A\u000ACheeseburger, White MannaHackensack, NJ\u000A\u000AThe burgers here are small, and when I asked what the record was for the most eaten at one sitting, the grill cook told me that some guy had managed thirty-two. I was awed, not because somebody ate thirty-two burgers of about two ounces each but that this superhero also ate thirty-two potato rolls, and they looked full-size to me. New Jersey is one manly state. It\u0027s also a legendary diner state, boasting some of the best in America. White Manna is a 1930s artifact with a horseshoe-shaped counter that seats twelve. In the middle of the horseshoe stands the grill cook, behaving like a sushi chef, molding, cooking, handing out the burgers. Ask for cheese and onion and the too-big roll fills up amazingly well.\u000A\u000AHamburger, J. G. MelonNew York City\u000A\u000A\u0022The best burger is the one you want the minute your plane touches down after you\u0027ve been in Europe for three months,\u0022 said a friend of mine, an Upper East Sider with the money to do exactly that. \u0022For me, this is the one.\u0022 J.G. Melon\u0027s burger is a Manhattan benchmark. The bun is nicely toasted. The meat is juicy but doesn\u0027t drip. The red onion is thinly sliced. Like well-to-do people with manners, the burger is perfectly correct. The bar scene is a bit annoying—too many yuppies on cell phones, reminding one another how well they\u0027re doing—but otherwise democracy prevails: no reservations, no credit cards, no playing favorites.\u000A\u000ABuild Your Own Burger, The CounterSanta Monica, CA\u000A\u000AI asked the young girl taking orders if she had ever seen a burger duplicated. \u0022Not really,\u0022 she replied. \u0022You think it might happen, and then somebody adds avocado.\u0022\u000A\u000ABy the owner\u0027s calculations, this spot offers more than 300,000 possibilities. At the minimum, you can ask for a one-third-pound plain burger on a regular bun. At the extreme, you can have, for example, a two-thirds- pound veggie burger topped with herbed-goat-cheese spread, roasted-corn-and- black-bean salsa, hard-boiled egg, and dried cranberries on a honey-wheat bun. At least you can. I wouldn\u0027t.\u000A\u000AHamburger &amp; Fries, Burger JointSan Francisco, CA\u000A\u000ANo place looks less like a joint. It should be renamed the Obsessive-Compulsive Café. It\u0027s neat. It\u0027s scrubbed. The decor is fake \u002750s, with overhead Jetsons-style light fixtures plus red vinyl and stainless steel. The burger is so artistically presented it could be Japanese. (Do the Japanese have burger joints?) Neatly set on a stainless-steel plate is a sheet of wad paper, and atop that rests a deconstructed burger, with a dollop of mayo on the top half of the grilled sesame-seed bun and a burger made from Niman Ranch beef on the bottom half. Lettuce, tomato, red onion, and pickle sit in one orderly pile, fries in another. The people who run the Burger Joint have gotten everything right, except the name.\u000A\u000ADouble Bacon Delu with Cheese, Red Mill BurgersSeattle, WA\u000A\u000AI got up to leave. My friend, a Seattle resident, yanked me back. I\u0027d just finished eating the basic Red Mill Burger, which is an overdone quarter-pound patty with lettuce and a light, spicy mayo dressing that turned the meat white. Just in time, she remembered what she loved: the burger with everything. The American cheese is artfully melted, the thick pepper bacon superb, the soft roll pretty wonderful, the red onion sweet, the lettuce and tomato good enough, and the mayo dressing just right with this pile of ingredients. It\u0027s a first-rate burger, provided you ask for your meat rare. It won\u0027t come rare, but it will be juicy.\u000A\u000AHamburger, Poag Mahone\u0027s Carvery and Ale HouseChicago, IL\u000A\u000AThe television, tuned to a Cubs game, was so loud I had to scream my order several times, and all I was trying to say was \u0022hamburger.\u0022 I know everybody in Chicago is depressed because the Cubs never win. I never realized they were also deaf. I\u0027d be disheartened, too, if I had to eat burgers in Chicago—Poag Mahone\u0027s was the only place I found that did burgers right. Good bakery buns, soft and sweet. Tasty ground sirloin given a nice char on an indoor grill. Even a \u0022Burger Eater\u0027s Bill of Rights.\u0022 Poag Mahone\u0027s lived up to most of its promises, although the pickle spear, guaranteed \u0022crisp and cold,\u0022 was a tad warm.\u000A\u000AOur Famous Burger, Sidetrack Bar and GrillYpsilanti, MI\u000A\u000AHere is one of my core culinary credos: The closer you come to a college campus, the worse burgers get. Sidetrack Bar and Grill—named for its location next to an old railroad siding—is an exception. This modern-looking pub, around since 1850, doesn\u0027t seem concerned with pleasing undiscerning Eastern Michigan University freshmen. \u0022We don\u0027t get much of a young crowd,\u0022 my waitress said. The meat, a secret blend, tastes like chuck. The sesame-seed bun is small, soft, and grilled. I recommend a visit to the automobile museum across the street, although they won\u0027t let you play drive-in and eat your burger in a vintage car.\u000A\u000AHamburger Sandwich, Louis\u0027 LunchNew Haven, CT\u000A\u000AThe crew numbers two. A young man takes your order and makes change. An elderly woman in elastic-waist slacks makes the toast, forms the patties, broils the meat, assembles the burgers (with a schmear of something like Cheez Whiz, a tomato slice, and raw onion), slices them in half, sets them on the counter. She\u0027s fast, real fast. In a senior-citizen table-tennis tournament, I\u0027d put my money on her. There are no buns, no fries, no ketchup. Louis\u0027 Lunch claims to have made America\u0027s first hamburger sandwich, back in 1900. If it\u0027s true, it was as significant a moment as the discovery of fire.",

data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.0">The hamburger is a symbol of everything that makes America great. Straightforward, egalitarian, substantial, and good-natured, it is also a little bloody at times.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1">It may come big and ungarnished, the East Coast ideal, tender and untroubled by bones or gristle, everything you look for in a filet mignon but seldom find. It may be the West Coast model, swelling with vegetation, brimming with health and well-being, piled high with all that a seed catalog can provide. A great burger, regardless of regional differences, instills a sense of optimism and fulfillment, that all is right at the table or the counter or the woodgrain, screwed-to-the-floor, fast-food booth.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.2">At its best, it eliminates the need for conversation or the urge to glance up at the TV over the bar. If you find yourself eating silently, eyes closed, ignoring everything around you, even the unavoidable burger-joint din, you have come upon a burger that can be pronounced a success.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.3">Of course, it must be molded by hand, artfully seared, and offered medium-rare. If that&#x2019;s too much to ask, not overcooked would be nice. Whose idea was it anyway that serving desiccated burgers to Americans would enable all of us to spring back to health? Excessive reliance on condiments is another alarming development, especially in the matter of ketchup, the burger Band-Aid. Ketchup is valuable only when an emergency jolt of moisture, sweetness, acidity, and flavor is required. No hamburger is inedible if you put enough ketchup on it, but no hamburger that has ketchup on it can be considered great. Mustard is a mistake, unless you&#x2019;re French and welcome a vinegary jolt with your food, while pickles, those subversive little sweet and sour instruments, fill me with dread. When I find pickles furtively inserted into my burger, I generally look to the heavens with a clenched fist and sob, &#x201C;Why?&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.5">I&#x2019;ve always claimed I&#x2019;d go a long way for the right burger, and indeed I did. I traveled 23,750 miles&#x2014;that&#x2019;s just 1,152 miles short of encircling the globe at the equator&#x2014;looking for the best ones in America. I consumed more than 150,000 calories but resisted drinking a can of soda with every burger, saving more than 22,000 calories that way. I ate crazy burgers, Kobe burgers, bison burgers, longhorn burgers, ostrich burgers, onion burgers, lamb burgers, and of course, cheeseburgers. (Note that cheese goes so well with burgers that the word is assembled differently, with no space in between.) I tried fast-food burgers, and while there&#x2019;s a sameness to them that overwhelms any attempts at excellence, I found some mighty fine values on those dollar menus, assuming you don&#x2019;t mind your burgers hard and dry, like the smiles on the faces of the teenagers who take your order. I visited Burger Heaven. Actually, I went to a few places called that. I was also in burger hell, which is Milwaukee, home of the butter burger, essentially meat saturated with grease.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.6">My goal was to find the twenty best burgers, and with apologies to all the restaurants, stands, bars, and grills I missed, I&#x2019;d like to believe I did well. I ate 162 burgers in ninety-three establishments. Some of them were fancified, proffering foie gras-stuffed burgers costing as much as $29. Some were dumps, with burgers hovering near a buck. At no time, despite pleas from loved ones, did I have a physician standing by. I found no correlation between price and tastiness, nor did ambience count for a great deal. A burger requires only a cook of modest accomplishments, one who knows enough to remove it from the fire before it has lost its juiciness and not to press down hard with a spatula&#x2014;squishing might work with grilled cheese, but it&#x2019;s fatal for burgers. Waitresses who work in burger joints can have scars and tattoos, as long as they&#x2019;re not self-inflicted. Motorcycles are fine, provided they&#x2019;re not parked inside.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.7">To be precise, I visited ninety-five places, but I didn&#x2019;t eat at two. In Boston, I attempted lunch at Tim&#x2019;s Bar and Grill, which features a huge rubber garbage pail in the dining area. The waitress was so surly (&#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t like the service, you can leave&#x201C;) that I walked out. Where&#x2019;d you find your decorator, Tim, at the sanitation department? I also undertook a 360-mile round-trip drive to Little Compton, Rhode Island, to try the burger at the legendary Commons Lunch, only to find that it had burned down.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.8">In the course of my travels, I learned to love the bun. Bunless, a burger is merely a chopped steak, the food of mess halls and chow lines, prisons and cafeterias. The roll makes the burger, although it must not be too large or too obtrusive; a common error of steak houses, which rarely offer memorable burgers, is that they buy buns so big, fat, and tall that their burgers assume the dimensions of wedding cakes. A bun may be lightly toasted or grilled, but it is vital that it be fresh. I am also possessed of newfound respect for the onion, which is rarely esteemed. A few thin circles of mild raw onion add sweetness and crunch. Nothing else is needed on a burger, although cheese has its place.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.9"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.a">I took my father to a roadhouse specializing in burgers in South Miami, a decision I regretted. The parking lot was practically rubble, overgrown with weeds. He was unable to use his walker, but we finally made it into Bill &amp; Ted&#x2019;s Tavern with me half-lifting him and apologizing for being an inconsiderate son.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.b">We ordered, and I&#x2019;ll never forget the glow when he bit into his burger after years of assisted-living cuisine. I thought the burgers were slightly overcooked, but the onion-relish-pickle package was brilliantly balanced, a condiment tour de force, and when I asked him why he was so happy, he said, &#x201C;I never get to eat food like this.&#x201C; The burger, fare not favored by institutional nutritionists, invariably inspires affection. It brings back memories of backyard barbecues and family gatherings, and it comes in all sizes, adding to its appeal. Burgers can be as small as a couple of ounces or as large as a full pound, although it seems that whenever restaurants dish up the largest size, they feel obligated to issue warnings. (&#x201C;Try our new 1lb. burger&#x2026;if you dare,&#x201C; read the promo for the Burgerpalooza at the Jolly Trolley in Mamaroneck, New York.)</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.c">The oversize burger is a haunch of ground meat, hand-formed, upon which the diner happily gnaws. It is an exaggeration of America&#x2019;s plenty, the banana split of sandwiches. Smaller burgers are essentially platforms for unlimited embellishments. Piled high with extras, this breed of burger is a pi&#xF1;ata at a birthday party, a festival miniaturized. Everybody who loves beef has a favorite burger, but hardly anybody agrees on which is best. Before heading off, I consulted food Web sites, food experts, and food writers. I was persuaded by a fellow I met at a food festival in Virginia to visit a restaurant outside Lawton, Oklahoma, that he promised had the best burger in America. I drove up from Dallas, more than 200 miles, to eat at Meers Store &amp; Restaurant, located next to a bison preserve. The menu read: &#x201C;All steaks &amp; hamburgers cooked to order,&#x201C; and I had this conversation with my waiter:</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.d">ME: Medium-rare, please.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.e">HIM: All our burgers are well-done.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.f">ME: The menu says they&#x2019;re cooked to order.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.g">HIM: That means we don&#x2019;t start cooking until you order it.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.h">I had a cheeseburger anyway, and it&#x2019;s a shame the cook had to ruin it, because the concept was a good one&#x2014;a wide, flat burger with gooey cheese. I believe I&#x2019;ve made my feelings clear about the medium-rare burger, but if the meat is particularly lean, it should be eaten rare. A well-done burger is a badly done burger, food for the meek, and if that&#x2019;s the way we&#x2019;re going to have our burgers, then we might as well give up trying to enjoy ourselves and make green salads our national dish.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.i">Although I endured occasional disappointments, I never wearied of life on the hamburger highway. No matter how many burgers I ate, and I believe my daily consumption never exceeded six, no matter how full of chopped beef I was at the end of a long but satisfying day, I always woke up the next morning eager to begin again.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.j"><hr></div><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.k"><ol><li>Sirloin Burger, <strong>Le Tub</strong><p>Hollywood, FL</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.l">This is a dream of a dump, located on the site of a former Sunoco gas station. Outside there&#x2019;s assorted porcelain&#x2014;toilets, sinks, tubs. Most have plants in them, and a lot of the plants look dead. Inside is a pool table, a jukebox, and tables reminiscent of the ones at highway rest stops. The view is magnificent, the Intracoastal Waterway at its broadest and most dramatic. Le Tub doesn&#x2019;t take credit cards, and it has signs everywhere reinforcing that rule. I&#x2019;m surprised anybody who eats here qualifies for a credit card.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.m">The menu is big, and the food isn&#x2019;t bad, except for the Sirloin Burger, which is magnificent. It&#x2019;s slowly seared on an indoor grill, crusty on the outside, juicy inside, always perfectly cooked. At eight to ten ounces, it&#x2019;s ideal big-burger size, and it&#x2019;s shaped like a pincushion, with sloping sides, which means you get a nice gradient of doneness. The bun has a few poppy seeds and looks like a kaiser roll, but it&#x2019;s smaller and softer. It&#x2019;s just right for enveloping the meat, which is judiciously seasoned and spiced, mostly with salt and pepper, I suspect. That&#x2019;s all it needs. No cheese or condiments required.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.n">I don&#x2019;t understand how this spot came to have the best burger in America, but it does. Regardless of where I am in South Florida, I always make my way here for lunch. I sit at the bar and watch yachts that cost millions drift by, draped with women who cost more, and I think to myself how lucky I am to be at Le Tub.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.o"><ol><li>Luger Burger, <strong>Peter Luger Steak House</strong><p>Brooklyn, NY</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.p">The legendary Peter Luger is celebrated for its porterhouse, which is buttered, seared, and sliced. But consider this: Its burger (available only at lunch) may be even better than the steak.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.q">At first glance, the roll seems too large, as it is at most steak houses. It isn&#x2019;t. The half pound of beef, so charred on the outside it appears overcooked, isn&#x2019;t. The magnificent roll settles beautifully around the succulent, juicy burger, assembled from prime aged-porterhouse trimmings and prime chuck. You can get raw onion. Don&#x2019;t. It comes with steak sauce. Superfluous. You can have cheese. Unnecessary. There&#x2019;s a bacon option. Hold on. The bacon, three-eighths-inch thick, slightly blackened, smoky, and chewy-tender, complements the beef the way mustard accents a hot dog. I can never decide: With bacon? Without bacon? Both ways are just right. The fries are among the best in America. One warning: While you&#x2019;re waiting for your burger to arrive, try not to eat the entire basket of irresistible bread.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.r"><ol><li>Not Just a Burger, <strong>Spiced Pear Restaurant at the Chanler Hotel</strong><p>Newport, RI</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.s">This burger doesn&#x2019;t taste like a burger. It&#x2019;s more in the North Carolina pulled-pork family, even though it&#x2019;s all Kobe beef. (Kobe beef has a lot of the qualities of pork&#x2014;it&#x2019;s soft and sweet.) Chef Richard Hamilton, who has big-time talent, makes the best high-concept burger in America. His roll, which is a bit towering, worried me at first, but it flattened beautifully and didn&#x2019;t get in the way. The burger, which consists of barbecued Kobe brisket surrounded by chopped Kobe beef, is topped with enormously complex but not overpowering coleslaw and sits on a tomato-onion jam that&#x2019;s sort of a cross between ketchup and barbecue sauce.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.t">The twelve-ounce creation isn&#x2019;t so much a juicy burger as a mouthwatering, heart-stopping, wildly rich chopped-beef sandwich every bit as satisfying as the best sandwich you&#x2019;ve ever eaten down south. It&#x2019;s a burger breakthrough, and the accompanying garlic-basil-Parmesan potato chips are awe-inspiring.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.u"><ol><li>Rouge Burger, <strong>Rouge</strong><p>Philadelphia.

(Who knew that white slavery lived on in stuffy old Philadelphia?) Do these people care that they&#x2019;re eating the best cheeseburger in America? Rouge is so chic I&#x2019;m surprised that anybody pays attention to the food. I&#x2019;m sure they admire the staff, all in black. They probably enjoy sitting outside, right on Rittenhouse Square. Back when I was growing up in the city, outdoor dining didn&#x2019;t exist.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.w">How is a simple, plump cheeseburger able to compete with all this stylishness? The Rouge Burger does just fine. The aged Gruy&#xE8;re cheese is strong, nutty, and pungent. The caramelized onion is judiciously applied. The bread is toasted brioche. The fries are good. The well-salted sirloin is very lean, so it&#x2019;s best ordered rare. I could swear the hostess, to stand out from her minions, was wearing pink pajamas, but maybe I was dizzy with pleasure from dining at Rouge and encountering a Philadelphia I never knew.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.x"><ol><li>Kobe Sliders, <strong>Barclay Prime</strong><p>Philadelphia, PA</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.y">A slider is the small and rather grotesque (but nonetheless tasty) burger bagged by the bunch at White Castle. The meat in a genuine slider is square, steam-fried, overdone, and punctured with tiny holes, as though it had been attacked by a vampire. Hamburgers on naval vessels are sometimes called sliders. All in all, sliders aren&#x2019;t esteemed in the gastronomic firmament.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.z">At Barclay Prime, a new steak house, the small burgers are inexplicably referred to as sliders, but they&#x2019;re not sliders at all. They&#x2019;re a mighty three inches tall. Each is made with two ounces of Kobe beef, and they come two to an order, on miniature, exceptionally buttery brioche buns. One is topped with sliced tomato and marinated shallots, the other with caramelized onion and Gruy&#xE8;re. They may be the most succulent burgers in America, and they&#x2019;re automatically prepared medium-rare. I asked our waiter why a steak house would have a need for sliders, and he replied proudly, &#x201C;They&#x2019;re like little protein appetizers. It&#x2019;s amazing how perfectly they get the palate ready for a big steak.&#x201C;</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.10"><ol><li>California Burger, <strong>Houston&apos;s</strong><p>Santa Monica, CA</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.11">When you figure how many millions of burgers emerge from chain-restaurant kitchens, it&#x2019;s not surprising that one of them gets it right. Houston&#x2019;s, a big, bustling, commercial spot, nails its California Burger.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.12">This burger had no flaws. Zero. The roll: soft and sweet, almost like brioche. The meat: coarsely ground and flavorful. The red onion: mild and crunchy. The cheese: fully melted Monterey Jack. The condiment: a touch of mustard-honey dressing. Avocado and arugula are another great touch. Houston&#x2019;s California Burger is a rainbow of colors, and it&#x2019;s comforting, perfect for soothing Santa Monica working stiffs after a hard morning at the macram&#xE9; shop. And talk about burger engineering. I asked the manager about the sliver of greenery under the burger, and he said it was cabbage, put there to avoid untoward sogginess at the base of the bun.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.13"><ol><li>Buckhorn Burger, <strong>Buckhorn</strong><p>San Antonio, NM</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.14">No burger has bigger flavors than the legendary New Mexico green-chili cheeseburger. Basically, it&#x2019;s too much of everything on a bun: ground beef, green chilies, mustard, tomato, lettuce, chopped onion, and pickle. Such a combination makes no culinary sense, but at Buckhorn, which makes the best green-chili cheeseburgers in a tiny town devoted to little else, the result is spectacularly tasty and eminently coherent. The too strong onions, hot-pungent chilies, and potent mustard all battle to a spectacular draw. The cheese is the binder and the pickle the crunchy refresher, while the lettuce and tomato hang on for dear life and the coarsely ground beef acts as a solid, sensible underpinning.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.15">Buckhorn tavern, which naturally calls its green-chili cheeseburger a Buckhorn Burger, offers a great mouthful of hot, sweet, juicy, chewy flavors.

It appears to be a place where people vanish and don&#x2019;t reappear for days, but locals don&#x2019;t come here to drink. The day I visited, everybody was bellied up to the bar, eating burgers.</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.18">They&#x2019;re made from ground round, which is lean and usually flavorless. Here it&#x2019;s been used for burgers since the &#x2019;50s, so I was willing to try one, figuring Miller&#x2019;s might know something I didn&#x2019;t. I ended up eating three. I ordered the first medium-rare, and it was very good, made from the juiciest round I&#x2019;ve ever tasted. I ordered the second rare, and it was sensational. The cheeseburger, topped with Velveeta, a variation on American cheese, was darned good, too. When I asked my waitress what made the burger so special, she suggested it might be the well-seasoned grill, which had been replaced only once in the fifteen years she&#x2019;d worked there. Miller&#x2019;s has no menu, no tomatoes, no lettuce, no plates, no utensils, and no check&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all on the honor system. When I asked the bartender to explain the fortress-like look, he told me with a straight face that cars speeding down Michigan Avenue were always crashing into the building, so the owners decided to make it impregnable.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.19"><ol><li>Cheeseburger, <strong>Burger Joint, le Parker Meridien Hotel</strong><p>New York City</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1a">This spot is supposed to look like a small-town &#x2019;50s burger hangout, but it doesn&#x2019;t. It looks like a small-town &#x2019;50s pizza hangout. (Burger joints had more chrome.) Still, it&#x2019;s masterfully geeky, with hideous fake-wood paneling. I thought a particularly nice touch was a Christmas wreath in June. The burgers, however they&#x2019;re ordered, will have you dancing the jitterbug. The day I stopped in, a hotel chef by the name of Rudi&#x2014;the name was stitched on his fancy chef&#x2019;s whites&#x2014;was cooking, and he got them exactly right. The plain burger on an Arnold bun was the essence of classic simplicity. The cheeseburger with the works&#x2014;tomato, lettuce, onion, pickle, ketchup, mayo, and mustard&#x2014;was even better, especially when the counterman didn&#x2019;t overdo the mustard-mayo- ketchup amalgam. (Very few restaurants leave the vital job of accessorizing to customers.) The burger joint has quickly become a Manhattan icon, where persons of all economic stations gather to eat in peace. Or maybe it&#x2019;s more like a jungle watering hole, where the animals wait until they&#x2019;ve departed before they start tearing one another apart.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><ol><li>Number Five, <strong>Keller&apos;s Drive-in</strong><p>Dallas, TX</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1c">The lady in the red Lexus that was parked alongside me leaned out the window and said, &#x201C;If you come here with a friend who has a convertible, you can sit all night. It&#x2019;s better than going to a nice restaurant.&#x201C; Keller&#x2019;s, out on Northwest Highway, is the best drive-in I&#x2019;ve ever seen, and I try not to miss many. Flash your lights and out come the carhops, who aren&#x2019;t dolled up and aren&#x2019;t on roller skates, although they will call you &#x201C;sweetie.&#x201C; They&#x2019;re also strong enough to lug cases of beer out to waiting cars. (Not many restaurants specialize in beer by the case.)</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1d">Keller&#x2019;s is filled with guys hanging out. They sit on the tailgates of their pickups, feet up on coolers. The burger of choice is the Number Five, made exactly the way hamburgers were back when drive-ins first appeared, about a half-century ago. At $2.38, it&#x2019;s not priced a whole lot more than it would have been back then. The Number Five includes two beef patties, shredded lettuce, tomato, American cheese, and a Thousand Island&#x2013;style &#x201C;special sauce&#x201C; on a soft grilled poppy-seed role. The meat&#x2019;s overcooked, but that doesn&#x2019;t diminish the nostalgia, maybe the best in the burger world. Keller&#x2019;s even has a galvanized tin roof to protect cars. I suggested to my waitress, Lana, that it probably sounded awfully loud when it rained. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not so bad,&#x201C; she replied, &#x201C;but you should hear it when it hails.&#x201C;</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><ol><li>Grilled Bistro Burger, <strong>Bistro Don Giovanni</strong><p>Napa, CA</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1f">Although this supremely cute spot does everything skillfully, I don&#x2019;t recommend ordering your burger any which way but plain. It&#x2019;s just too good to dress up with grilled onion or cheese or garlic-mayonnaise. The meat is chuck, and the roll a subdued version of focaccia, which is bread brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with salt. The burger is perfectly cooked on an indoor mesquite grill, and not much food is more delicious than that. Sure, you can charcoal-grill at home, but then you have to worry about famished neighbors climbing over your fence.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><ol><li>Hamburger, <strong>Bobcat Bite</strong><p>Sante Fe, NM</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1h">Although Bobcat Bite is famous for its green-chili cheeseburger, its best burger comes unadorned and is a mix of chuck and sirloin, the perfect blend. My admiration for this burger may also have been elevated by the tiny restaurant&#x2019;s unsurpassed ambience. It stands between the Jemez Mountains and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which glow red when reflecting the setting sun. While I was waiting for a table, some kindly locals pointed out the high-desert flora to me. Or maybe it was the fauna.

I was awed, not because somebody ate thirty-two burgers of about two ounces each but that this superhero also ate thirty-two potato rolls, and they looked full-size to me. New Jersey is one manly state. It&#x2019;s also a legendary diner state, boasting some of the best in America. White Manna is a 1930s artifact with a horseshoe-shaped counter that seats twelve. In the middle of the horseshoe stands the grill cook, behaving like a sushi chef, molding, cooking, handing out the burgers.

Melon&#x2019;s burger is a Manhattan benchmark. The bun is nicely toasted. The meat is juicy but doesn&#x2019;t drip. The red onion is thinly sliced. Like well-to-do people with manners, the burger is perfectly correct. The bar scene is a bit annoying&#x2014;too many yuppies on cell phones, reminding one another how well they&#x2019;re doing&#x2014;but otherwise democracy prevails: no reservations, no credit cards, no playing favorites.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1m"><ol><li>Build Your Own Burger, <strong>The Counter</strong><p>Santa Monica, CA</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1n">I asked the young girl taking orders if she had ever seen a burger duplicated. &#x201C;Not really,&#x201C; she replied. &#x201C;You think it might happen, and then somebody adds avocado.&#x201C;</p><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1o">By the owner&#x2019;s calculations, this spot offers more than 300,000 possibilities. At the minimum, you can ask for a one-third-pound plain burger on a regular bun. At the extreme, you can have, for example, a two-thirds- pound veggie burger topped with herbed-goat-cheese spread, roasted-corn-and- black-bean salsa, hard-boiled egg, and dried cranberries on a honey-wheat bun. At least <em>you</em> can. I wouldn&#x2019;t.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1p"><ol><li>Hamburger &amp; Fries, <strong>Burger Joint</strong><p>San Francisco, CA</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1q">No place looks less like a joint. It should be renamed the Obsessive-Compulsive Caf&#xE9;. It&#x2019;s neat. It&#x2019;s scrubbed. The decor is fake &#x2019;50s, with overhead <em>Jetsons</em>-style light fixtures plus red vinyl and stainless steel. The burger is so artistically presented it could be Japanese. (Do the Japanese have burger joints?) Neatly set on a stainless-steel plate is a sheet of wad paper, and atop that rests a deconstructed burger, with a dollop of mayo on the top half of the grilled sesame-seed bun and a burger made from Niman Ranch beef on the bottom half. Lettuce, tomato, red onion, and pickle sit in one orderly pile, fries in another. The people who run the Burger Joint have gotten everything right, except the name.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1r"><ol><li>Double Bacon Delu with Cheese, <strong>Red Mill Burgers</strong><p>Seattle, WA</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1s">I got up to leave. My friend, a Seattle resident, yanked me back. I&#x2019;d just finished eating the basic Red Mill Burger, which is an overdone quarter-pound patty with lettuce and a light, spicy mayo dressing that turned the meat white. Just in time, she remembered what she loved: the burger with everything. The American cheese is artfully melted, the thick pepper bacon superb, the soft roll pretty wonderful, the red onion sweet, the lettuce and tomato good enough, and the mayo dressing just right with this pile of ingredients. It&#x2019;s a first-rate burger, provided you ask for your meat rare. It won&#x2019;t come rare, but it will be juicy.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1t"><ol><li>Hamburger, <strong>Poag Mahone&apos;s Carvery and Ale House</strong><p>Chicago, IL</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1u">The television, tuned to a Cubs game, was so loud I had to scream my order several times, and all I was trying to say was &#x201C;hamburger.&#x201C; I know everybody in Chicago is depressed because the Cubs never win. I never realized they were also deaf. I&#x2019;d be disheartened, too, if I had to eat burgers in Chicago&#x2014;Poag Mahone&#x2019;s was the only place I found that did burgers right. Good bakery buns, soft and sweet. Tasty ground sirloin given a nice char on an indoor grill. Even a &#x201C;Burger Eater&#x2019;s Bill of Rights.&#x201C; Poag Mahone&#x2019;s lived up to most of its promises, although the pickle spear, guaranteed &#x201C;crisp and cold,&#x201C; was a tad warm.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1v"><ol><li>Our Famous Burger, <strong>Sidetrack Bar and Grill</strong><p>Ypsilanti, MI</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1w">Here is one of my core culinary credos: The closer you come to a college campus, the worse burgers get. Sidetrack Bar and Grill&#x2014;named for its location next to an old railroad siding&#x2014;is an exception. This modern-looking pub, around since 1850, doesn&#x2019;t seem concerned with pleasing undiscerning Eastern Michigan University freshmen. &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t get much of a young crowd,&#x201C; my waitress said. The meat, a secret blend, tastes like chuck. The sesame-seed bun is small, soft, and grilled. I recommend a visit to the automobile museum across the street, although they won&#x2019;t let you play drive-in and eat your burger in a vintage car.</p><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1x"><ol><li>Hamburger Sandwich, <strong>Louis&apos; Lunch</strong><p>New Haven, CT</p></li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.4.1y">The crew numbers two. A young man takes your order and makes change. An elderly woman in elastic-waist slacks makes the toast, forms the patties, broils the meat, assembles the burgers (with a schmear of something like Cheez Whiz, a tomato slice, and raw onion), slices them in half, sets them on the counter. She&#x2019;s fast, real fast. In a senior-citizen table-tennis tournament, I&#x2019;d put my money on her. There are no buns, no fries, no ketchup. Louis&#x2019; Lunch claims to have made America&#x2019;s first hamburger sandwich, back in 1900. If it&#x2019;s true, it was as significant a moment as the discovery of fire.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".2gn5inb5kw0.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
