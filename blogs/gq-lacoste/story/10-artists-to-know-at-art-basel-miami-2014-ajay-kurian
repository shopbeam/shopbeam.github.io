  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AName: Ajay Kurian\u000A\u000A Age: 30\u000A\u000A Hometown: Baltimore, MD\u000A\u000A Gallery: 47 Canal\u000A\u000A What He\u0027s Taking: \u0022Three custom trash cans, each embodying the spirit of three of the four ghosts that haunt Faust: Want, Need, and Care. (I\u0027ve left out Guilt since it\u0027s an art fair...) There\u0027s also a lone, hanging chameleon doing what any contemporary creature does.\u0022\u000A\u000A Tool of choice: \u0022I suppose a drill since it\u0027s versatile\u0022\u000A\u000A Influencers: \u0022For this project? Marvin Gaye, Flying Lotus\u0027 album \u0027You\u0027re Dead!\u0027; the lion statues that mark the entrance of the Egyptian Museum in Berlin; Patrice O\u0027Neal; the five Boroughs; arcades; and poorly construed narratives of cultural evolution, among many other things, people, places, and atmospheres.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s the significance of taking trash bins to Basel? \u000A\u000AI feel like that statement is really a part of it. I was thinking about the weird purgatory of overflowing trashcans. Like, they\u0027re receptacles, but they\u0027re also pedestals, and then they sort of became plates. I think with a lot of my pieces there\u0027s a lot of plating in a sense, like there\u0027s something culinary. With this one, it became a kind of fucked up banquet.\u000A\u000AWere you religious or spiritual growing up? \u000A\u000AI feel like that has figured into my work quite a bit. My parents are Christian. I grew up with that, really wanting to believe, and then always having doubt, and then eschewing it completely before coming back to it. I still wanted to have a relationship about it with my parents…it\u0027s important to them. I started reading a lot more theology and philosophy and found that there were certain Christian mystic thinkers I could get down with. That opened up a lot of thinking for me. So in a sense I feel like I\u0027d like to empty religion out and make it ritual, instead.\u000A\u000ADON\u0027T MISS THIS\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000AA lot of times my pieces have a ritualistic quality, for example in the way that lighting is important. One of my pieces glows quite a bit, to view it you have to hover over it, and in doing so you sort of prostrate yourself. For me sculpture is very much about bodily sensation.\u000A\u000AMany of your pieces conjure up the idea of religiousness; there\u0027s a quality of focus, but then you include found objects like candy, which look like pills. There\u0027s something mind altering about it. \u000A\u000AI\u0027ve used custom M&amp;M\u0027s in a lot of pieces, so there are some in there, and there are some in an earlier piece. For one piece I had \u0027frats,\u0027 \u0027liberals,\u0027 and \u0027$$$,\u0027 printed on them—kind of like a riff on fraternity, equality, and liberty. It\u0027s a dumb riff, but that\u0027s what I wanted it to be.\u000A\u000AThe first time I used them was with this sculpture that was a vitrine inlaid into the wall with these red M&amp;M\u0027s that just said Obama on them. That was inspired by the television show Louis because there are a few episodes where—either in the background or the foreground of the audio—somebody\u0027s always muttering about Obama. There\u0027s this episode when he\u0027s on a blind date, and this woman\u0027s asking him, or forcing him, to eat her out. And he won\u0027t. She\u0027s just so fucking pissed, and finally she\u0027s just like, &amp;#x201C;fucking Obama.&amp;#x201D; That\u0027s the last thing she says! But then also when he\u0027s just in a space you\u0027ll see a crazy person in the background and he\u0027ll be like,&amp;#x201C;—and Obama!&amp;#x201D; It\u0027s this weird atmospheric thing.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s kind of the purpose of it: this atmospheric element—developing an atmosphere, which is not a language in the sense that every word is determined but a syntax. That\u0027s kind of how the new work has been coming along. It\u0027s been getting a little bit more intuitive, and I trust myself a bit more. That feels good.\u000A\u000AHow did you come to trust yourself more?\u000A\u000APractice. And a lot of failure. These pieces were so different before. Initially, I really did embrace the idea of them overflowing. And then I was really nervous about them because I didn\u0027t like them, but I liked things about them. I couldn\u0027t figure out what I was supposed to do next. So I had my girlfriend come by because she\u0027s a good, harsh critic, and when she saw them her demeanor was just really unsettling. I could tell that she wanted to find something to say that was constructive. That\u0027s just not a great place to be.\u000A\u000AThen over time I started to realize these weren\u0027t about making something exactly like what you would see outside. In I realized that this is exactly a scenario in which I can start doing what I think I\u0027m good at—this juxtaposition of objects, playing with them, and forcing them into these new, surreal vocabularies—and make that sharper.\u000A\u000AIs there a way you want a viewer would approach your work? Does that enter into your process?\u000A\u000AI always take myself as the viewer, maybe occasionally to my detriment. I\u0027ll say that every time I make a prescriptive statement about a viewer it\u0027s just me talking about myself; that\u0027s the best I can do.\u000A\u000AI have a lot of people come into the studio because I really do appreciate when they tell me what\u0027s on their mind—how they see it and what they\u0027re coming to it with. I\u0027ll make changes based on that every single time.\u000A\u000ADoes creating work help you combat feelings of frustration? \u000A\u000AI had a lot of frustration with these pieces in particular; they came from a sadder place. So this is the first time I\u0027ve let it be more personal and unabashed. In the very beginning it was more like creating flushed-out arguments. But, I started to realize the artists I admire the most are the ones that you walk away from with a gut feeling—something that hits you in your body.\u000A\u000AWhat do you think Basel does for young artists either to their benefit or to their detriment? \u000A\u000AA lot of people are making product. I think plenty of people are thinking about the art fair as a way of making their money for the year so they can do what they want to do. That\u0027s fine. Everyone needs to make a living. Recently, because there are so many art fairs, and because so many galleries are now more or less obligated to take part, it\u0027s now the kind of thing where you do need to treat it as an exhibition. There are stakes. I think that\u0027s a good thing.\u000A\u000AWhen I was making this I was thinking, \u0027this is not the time to make something symphonic. This is the time to make a pop song.\u0027 And that\u0027s not a bad thing; it just means it has to be tight, it has to be short, and it has to punch. There needs to be a hook.\u000A\u000AThe way I think about Basel is that it is an opportunity to get collectors and people that are gathered in one place. There\u0027s no exhibition that does that on the same scale.\u000A\u000AWhy should people care about art at all? \u000A\u000AThis is going to sound so romantic, but in the beginning I used to think, \u0027I make art. I\u0027m an artist.\u0027 Now I can\u0027t do anything else, in the sense that I\u0027m compelled to continue to make things. I think that\u0027s why art exists: because people want to. They want to challenge themselves.\u000A\u000AWhy should people care about it is a different question, which has to do with education. I think there\u0027s been a narrowing of what education means and what\u0027s beneficial. Something that art does very well—visual art, literature, and music—is that it\u0027s always speaking several languages at once. In literature it\u0027s easier to see this: you follow a narrative, you embody it, and you exist within the contradictions of the story. That\u0027s what makes it feel real.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s about understanding that things are not just a series of switches where everything makes sense. To me art has always been really good at fortifying the world with spaces that are speaking so many different tongues that you have to come to terms with the fact that it doesn\u0027t all add up. Within whatever totality you\u0027re looking at, what makes that living organism is not every gear in its place, but instead, it\u0027s wholes and parts. Which sounds like magic, but it\u0027s not. Something I think art ought to do is surpass any equation you could possibly have for it.",

I was thinking about the weird purgatory of overflowing trashcans. Like, they&#x2019;re receptacles, but they&#x2019;re also pedestals, and then they sort of became plates. I think with a lot of my pieces there&#x2019;s a lot of plating in a sense, like there&#x2019;s something culinary.

My parents are Christian. I grew up with that, really wanting to believe, and then always having doubt, and then eschewing it completely before coming back to it. I still wanted to have a relationship about it with my parents&#x2026;it&#x2019;s important to them. I started reading a lot more theology and philosophy and found that there were certain Christian mystic thinkers I could get down with. That opened up a lot of thinking for me. So in a sense I feel like I&#x2019;d like to empty religion out and make it ritual, instead.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.d">DON&#x2019;T MISS THIS</p><div class="embed image"

lighting is important. One of my pieces glows quite a bit, to view it you have to hover over it, and in doing so you sort of prostrate yourself. For me sculpture is very much about bodily sensation.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Many of your pieces conjure up the idea of religiousness; there&#x2019;s a quality of focus, but then you include found objects like candy, which look like pills. There&#x2019;s something mind altering about it. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.j">I&#x2019;ve used custom M&amp;M&#x2019;s in a lot of pieces, so there are some in there, and there are some in an earlier piece. For one piece I had &#x2019;frats,&#x2019; &#x2019;liberals,&#x2019; and &#x2019;$$$,&#x2019; printed on them&#x2014;kind of like a riff on fraternity, equality, and liberty. It&#x2019;s a dumb riff, but that&#x2019;s what I wanted it to be.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.k">The first time I used them was with this sculpture that was a vitrine inlaid into the wall with these red M&amp;M&#x2019;s that just said Obama on them. That was inspired by the television show <em>Louis</em> because there are a few episodes where&#x2014;either in the background or the foreground of the audio&#x2014;somebody&#x2019;s always muttering about Obama. There&#x2019;s this episode when he&#x2019;s on a blind date, and this woman&#x2019;s asking him, or forcing him, to eat her out. And he won&#x2019;t. She&#x2019;s just so fucking pissed, and finally she&#x2019;s just like, &amp;#x201C;fucking Obama.&amp;#x201D; That&#x2019;s the last thing she says! But then also when he&#x2019;s just in a space you&#x2019;ll see a crazy person in the background and he&#x2019;ll be like,&amp;#x201C;&#x2014;and Obama!&amp;#x201D; It&#x2019;s this weird atmospheric thing.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.l">That&#x2019;s kind of the purpose of it: this atmospheric element&#x2014;developing an atmosphere, which is not a language in the sense that every word is determined but a syntax. That&#x2019;s kind of how the new work has been coming along. It&#x2019;s been getting a little bit more intuitive, and I trust myself a bit more. That feels good.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>How did you come to trust yourself more?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.n">Practice. And a lot of failure. These pieces were <em>so </em>different before. Initially, I really did embrace the idea of them overflowing. And then I was really nervous about them because I didn&#x2019;t like them, but I liked things about them. I couldn&#x2019;t figure out what I was supposed to do next. So I had my girlfriend come by because she&#x2019;s a good, harsh critic, and when she saw them her demeanor was just really unsettling. I could tell that she wanted to find something to say that was constructive. That&#x2019;s just not a great place to be.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.o">Then over time I started to realize these weren&#x2019;t about making something exactly like what you would see outside. In I realized that this is exactly a scenario in which I can start doing what I think I&#x2019;m good at&#x2014;this juxtaposition of objects, playing with them, and forcing them into these new, surreal vocabularies&#x2014;and make that sharper.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>Is there a way you want a viewer would approach your work? Does that enter into your process?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.q">I always take myself as the viewer, maybe occasionally to my detriment. I&#x2019;ll say that every time I make a prescriptive statement about a viewer it&#x2019;s just me talking about myself; that&#x2019;s the best I can do.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.r">I have a lot of people come into the studio because I really do appreciate when they tell me what&#x2019;s on their mind&#x2014;how they see it and what they&#x2019;re coming to it with. I&#x2019;ll make changes based on that every single time.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>Does creating work help you combat feelings of frustration? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.t">I had a lot of frustration with these pieces in particular; they came from a sadder place. So this is the first time I&#x2019;ve let it be more personal and unabashed. In the very beginning it was more like creating flushed-out arguments. But, I started to realize the artists I admire the most are the ones that you walk away from with a gut feeling&#x2014;something that hits you in your body.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong>What do you think Basel does for young artists either to their benefit or to their detriment? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.v">A lot of people are making product. I think plenty of people are thinking about the art fair as a way of making their money for the year so they can do what they want to do. That&#x2019;s fine. Everyone needs to make a living. Recently, because there are so many art fairs, and because so many galleries are now more or less obligated to take part, it&#x2019;s now the kind of thing where you <em>do </em>need to treat it as an exhibition. There are stakes. I think that&#x2019;s a good thing.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.w">When I was making this I was thinking, &#x2019;this is not the time to make something symphonic. This is the time to make a pop song.&#x2019; And that&#x2019;s not a bad thing; it just means it has to be tight, it has to be short, and it has to punch. There needs to be a hook.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.x">The way I think about Basel is that it is an opportunity to get collectors and people that are gathered in one place. There&#x2019;s no exhibition that does that on the same scale.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.y"><strong>Why should people care about art at all? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.z">This is going to sound so romantic, but in the beginning I used to think, &#x2019;I make art. I&#x2019;m an artist.&#x2019; Now I can&#x2019;t do anything else, in the sense that I&#x2019;m compelled to continue to make things. I think that&#x2019;s why art exists: because people want to. They want to challenge themselves.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.10">Why should people care about it is a different question, which has to do with education. I think there&#x2019;s been a narrowing of what education means and what&#x2019;s beneficial. Something that art does very well&#x2014;visual art, literature, and music&#x2014;is that it&#x2019;s always speaking several languages at once. In literature it&#x2019;s easier to see this: you follow a narrative, you embody it, and you exist within the contradictions of the story. That&#x2019;s what makes it feel real.</p><p data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.4.11">It&#x2019;s about understanding that things are not just a series of switches where everything makes sense. To me art has always been really good at fortifying the world with spaces that are speaking so many different tongues that you <em>have </em>to come to terms with the fact that it doesn&#x2019;t all add up. Within whatever totality you&#x2019;re looking at, what makes that living organism is not every gear in its place, but instead, it&#x2019;s wholes and parts. Which sounds like magic, but it&#x2019;s not. Something I think art <em>ought </em>to do is surpass any equation you could possibly have for it.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".6vsg0fc16o.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
