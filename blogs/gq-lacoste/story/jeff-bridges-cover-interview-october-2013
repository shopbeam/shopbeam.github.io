One explanation for the apparent contradiction of Jeff Bridges—who now, at age 63, is both among the most accomplished, consistently sought-after actors in Hollywood and, by reputation and vibe, also one of the nicest and most contented—is that Jeff Bridges lives up there in the ninth level. The ninth level—it\u0027s called, as I\u0027m sure you know, the amala consciousness—is kind of the penthouse of the mind, and up there you\u0027re freed from not only all that heavy karma you\u0027ve accumulated in your lifetimes, but the entire thinking mind! You\u0027re even blissfully unaffected by the overwhelming and cosmically unimportant stream of information the pedestrian world ceaselessly sends your way. Now, while Bridges has gone Zen in his late middle age, reads some Thich Nhat Hanh and knows Ram Dass and tries to meditate every day, he does not lay claim to living in one consciousness or another. But being both part of this earth and not would help us understand this:\u000A\u000A For breakfast on this late-July morning, Bridges has selected a little café called Swami\u0027s, right on the 101 in Encinitas, California. He arrives wearing comfortable jeans, canvas slip-on shoes, a kind of soft, towelly green shirt that buttons up the front. He\u0027s got his famously beautiful hair slicked back and wears black sunglasses. His body is big, lived in; it betrays almost no kinetic energy but instead a kind of stillness, like a giant boulder you might find while hiking in Canyonlands National Park that would cause you to contemplate the unfathomable enormity of time. Anyway, we order some breakfast and sit down. Bridges, who, just to remind you, has been playing music for fifty years and has put out two albums and wasn\u0027t lip-synching in Crazy Heart, is in Encinitas to play a show in the middle of an eight-date tour with his band, the Abiders. And GQ, seeing in him not only an accomplished gentleman of a certain age but also someone who, as we mention above, has attained a certain level of serious life contentment, has sought him out here to gather some wisdom. So our conversation begins, like awkward conversations at weddings have begun since time immemorial: Where ya coming in from? \u000A\u000ADON\u0027T MISS THIS\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestundefined\u000A\u000A \u0022Um...ha! Uhhhhh. We came in from, uh...\u0022 He laughs at this. Because it\u0027s funny! Isn\u0027t life funny when you\u0027re not always hung up on the cosmically unimportant stream of information the pedestrian world ceaselessly sends your way? \u0022Oh God, it all kind of blends! It\u0027s very tough for me to remember what we did. I want to get this right for you! So let me think. We played Laughlin, Nevada. We slept in. And then drove the four hours here. No, no, this isn\u0027t right. Ha!\u0022 He stands up and darts off. \u0022Let me go find Chris\u0022—his music director—\u0022so I can answer your first question!\u0022\u000A\u000A (He came in from Anaheim on Sunday night and had the day off yesterday.)\u000A\u000A Now, for some people this might be embarrassing. Or could cause a little anxiety: What the fuck, am I losing my mind? But not to Jeff Bridges. Hey, man, let go, the invisible currents of life force will carry you! Ha ha ha! What a ride. Bridges just isn\u0027t an anxious dude. Sitting close enough to him that you can hear him lazily ruminate his huevos rancheros confirms what you probably suspect from watching him in the movies: He might be the least anxious person in America (who has also won an Academy Award for best actor). As the film critic Pauline Kael famously wrote: Bridges \u0022may be the most natural and least self-conscious screen actor that has ever lived.\u0022\u000A\u000A When he comes back to our outdoor table at Swami\u0027s, named for the famous surf break just the other side of the 101, a comment is made about his lack of anxiety. Can you just teach us all how to be a little more like that? But he says I have it wrong. Even playing his music tonight here in Encinitas will involve a struggle that goes something like this: \u0022I go through the gamut of emotions. It\u0027s kind of like emotional weather. Feeling anxious. You know, a lot of anxiety. And that\u0027ll pass. Nothing will particularly change, except something inside. And then all of a sudden I\u0027m saying, Hey, this is fun, being alive! Look at that! Look at this!\u0022\u000A\u000A Listen, if you\u0027re going to be spending time with Bridges, you need to get comfortable analyzing your feelings.\u000A\u000A This is the point when we get up and go inside to get something from the juice bar.\u000A\u000A \u0022You ever had wheatgrass before?\u0022 Bridges says, contemplating the menu.\u000A\u000A \u0022No,\u0022 I say. Why do I lie about having had wheatgrass before? I don\u0027t know. You just don\u0027t want to deny Jeff Bridges the pleasure of introducing you to a wonderful health beverage.\u000A\u000A At the counter there\u0027s a tiny middle-aged man with a kelp bed of sun-bleached hair, sunburned eye sockets, a small puffy-lipped mouth. He\u0027s a fixture at Swami\u0027s, likes to call himself a co-owner. When he hears the conversation, he adds: \u0022You know, it\u0027s the microorganisms on the wheatgrass that are so amazing—the wheatgrass itself doesn\u0027t do anything.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Far out, man!\u0022 Bridges says.\u000A\u000A Then it dawns on the \u0022co-owner\u0022 who he\u0027s talking to. \u0022Hey, man!\u0022 he says. \u0022Will you write on our wall, man?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027ll tell you what, man. Why don\u0027t I come back later and draw you a picture!\u0022 Bridges says.\u000A\u000A When we\u0027re back at the table, I bring up the topic of marriage. This is another thing he seems to have figured out. If you know anything about Bridges, one of the things you know is that he\u0027s been married for almost forty years, that he has spent the better part of his life (a) being one of the best-looking, most famous men in the world and (b) waking up next to the same woman he met in his twenties. But I\u0027m particularly interested in something wise he said in an interview not long ago: In a marriage, every fight is the same fight, over and over again, in different forms. (Note to unwed readers: In a marriage, every fight is the same fight, over and over again, in different forms.) I ask him what his version of the fight is.\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m gonna take a little risk here, but I think this is so,\u0022 he says. He has removed his black glasses, and his light eyes almost disappear as he squints against the sun. \u0022I think that it\u0027s not only the same fight that you have with your spouse, but it\u0027s the same fight that everyone has with everyone—everyone. And basically the fight is: You don\u0027t get it.\u0022\u000A\u000A You don\u0027t get it?\u000A\u000A \u0022You don\u0027t get it! What is, for me, being alive. And what you do to me. And the thing is: That\u0027s true! I don\u0027t know how you feel, what it is to be you. But that\u0027s something to kind of celebrate and respect and honor! And that\u0027s, that\u0027s what we have in common. None of us, none of us, get each other. So you have to just be with that. And have a relationship with it. And, uh, usually what happens, if you hang with it enough, your love has to get bigger to hold that misunderstanding, that mystery.\u0022\u000A\u000A The wheatgrass arrives. \u0022You can do it like a shot, man,\u0022 he says. \u0022But I\u0027d just take a good swig of it.\u0022 We swig together. He looks at me, knowingly: \u0022Sweet, isn\u0027t it.\u0022\u000A\u000A We finish our microorganisms (it\u0027s sweet!), and I posit something on behalf of confused married people everywhere. Isn\u0027t the problem that this bigger love is fundamentally different from the romantic love that gets you married in the first place? Different from the hot-sex-all-the-time love you think at first that marriage is about?\u000A\u000A \u0022I don\u0027t know, it\u0027s kind of both, man! It\u0027s pretty sexy, too, when you get into that stuff. When you pop that? Some good lovemaking comes out of that stuff, don\u0027t you think? You have a fight, and you come out of that, and you say, Jeez, I don\u0027t understand you, but you\u0027re turning me on!\u0022\u000A\u000A When Bridges gets to describing a technique he and his wife use to communicate better—it\u0027s about just letting the other person talk, uninterrupted, as long as they want without responding to or arguing with what they say—he\u0027s interrupted by the approach of the straw-coiffed co-owner dude. He wants to shoot the shit a little more with Bridges.\u000A\u000A \u0022Not now, man!\u0022 Bridges says enthusiastically, motioning toward the tape recorder, which at this point only contains half of his marriage-communication method. \u0022I\u0027m doing a thing!\u0022 It\u0027s the most genuine, least mean way a famous person can blow off a fan. What I\u0027m doing right now is super important to me, so gimme a minute.\u000A\u000A When the co-owner is gone, the conversation turns to fidelity. It\u0027s something that Bridges, having been both married and an actor on remote sets with beautiful women for a long time, has done some thinking about. He suggests that the key here isn\u0027t necessarily simple restraint. Take a man who becomes consumed by a desire to stray:\u000A\u000A \u0022Well, live and learn. Go ahead and do it, and we\u0027ll see how that goes.\u0022\u000A\u000A Seriously? Just do it?\u000A\u000A \u0022Suppression can kind of get you into trouble, too,\u0022 he says. \u0022I was reading an interesting thing—this kind of goes with the meditation and the spiritual side of things that I\u0027m interested in. The difference between suppression and refraining. When you touch something hot, you don\u0027t have to repress the desire to touch it again.\u0022\u000A\u000A So you think you have to touch it first?\u000A\u000A \u0022Sometimes you do. It\u0027s like that old thing about addiction, I guess. About people hitting their bottom.\u0022\u000A\u000A What was your bottom?\u000A\u000A \u0022Ahh. I don\u0027t even want to talk about it. I don\u0027t want to make that a public thing. But I hit bottom.\u0022\u000A\u000A When we\u0027re done with breakfast, we head across the 101 to check out the break at Swami\u0027s (\u0022Look at that wave on the outside! Cooool. Beautiful\u0022), and then it\u0027s almost noon. Bridges needs to get back to his hotel. At my car, I tell him I\u0027ll see him at sound check down at the venue in Solana Beach, and we shake. But then he doesn\u0027t seem to know what to do. He peers around the parking lot: Shouldn\u0027t something appear right now? The means for my departure? The invisible currents of life force? I offer to drive him back to the hotel, and that sounds awesome to him. But before we leave, he remembers that he made a promise to the folks at Swami\u0027s.\u000A\u000A Bridges heads back inside, and the co-owner points out a bare spot on the wall where he can draw his picture. Bridges gets up on a stool and does a line drawing of a dude with a beard. Underneath it, he writes his most solemn oath: DIG IT. \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe show in Solana Beach that night goes off well. Jeff Bridges and the Abiders fill the Belly Up, a pleasant old club hewn from wood beams and hung with papier-m&amp;#xE2;ché sharks. He plays some songs from Crazy Heart, some songs of his own composition, some alt-country/dad-rock from his songwriting pals, a Tom Waits number. He\u0027s in the same jeans and shoes but has let his Jeff Bridges hair fall in lush layers like it does if you just give it half the chance. He\u0027s pretty good on the guitar and impressive on piano. Let\u0027s classify the crowd as prosperous drunk beach-town whities, and they are into the music. (Especially this one dude, late fifties, with a fat, boyish face who kind of spooks the crowd as he plays what I guess is an extremely long and pliant air guitar that also shrinks down so small he\u0027s essentially doing a grotesque, frenzied post-pee dick wangle.)\u000A\u000A But the music isn\u0027t the most interesting thing that\u0027s going on here. What\u0027s most interesting is the scene Bridges has constructed for himself on the tour. You\u0027ve got all these mellowed-out session musicians from Santa Barbara, where Bridges lives, playing around him. Jessie, his middle daughter, opens for him and sits in on a few numbers near the end, including \u0022Teach Your Children\u0022—which he\u0027s singing with one of his children! Bridges has worked with the same stand-in for the past sixty-some movies—his name is Loyd Catlett—and he\u0027s here, too. And next to him Sue, Bridges\u0027s wife. She\u0027s in gold slip-on shoes with flat heels, a little green satin backpack, and glasses with sparkles inlaid on the arms, and is listening with earplugs in. What we\u0027re seeing here is that Bridges has lived a life of relationship continuity, and here he is at the Belly Up reaping the rewards.\u000A\u000A Now, I\u0027m not saying that Jeff Bridges weaned his babies from a milk-dispensing man-brassiere and sewed calico pinafores for his three girls to wear to school. (When I catch up with Sue backstage, she teases Bridges about his parenting thusly: \u0022You can\u0027t screw up if you\u0027re not there!\u0022) But I am saying Bridges brought the full Bridges, consistent, unadulterated, to his family. Like, here he is on giving his eldest daughter away at the altar: \u0022We had a big party at our house. And to some people\u0027s embarrassment—I think my daughter kind of dug it, my wife probably thought it was over the top—I led everybody in a big om-ing\u000A\u000A session for about five minutes.\u0022 He laughs. \u0022I thought everybody got off. But I was pretty drunk myself.\u0022\u000A\u000A Or take Jessie, now touring with the Abiders. Before this, she\u0027d been doing some character building by way of working as Bridges\u0027s assistant on his past three films. You should hear her talk about lugging his French zero-gravity chair through the New Mexico mountains during the True Grit shoot: \u0022It\u0027s called a Lafuma, and it takes all of the pressure off your lower back. It holds you in this place where you\u0027re just like, Ahhh. Eventually I started to be like, \u0027I\u0027m not carrying that chair up another mountain.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A I mention the tableau Bridges has set up for himself here on the tour, and Sue says: \u0022Oh God, it\u0027s great! He\u0027s living out his teenage fantasy!\u0022\u000A\u000A Really? He told you his teenage fantasy?\u000A\u000A She peers scoldingly over the lenses of her glasses: \u0022We\u0027ve been married forty years.\u0022\u000A\u000A The fantasy isn\u0027t about role-playing and preening for people out there to get their Jeff Bridges fix, though. At one point during the show, Bridges makes the band start the same song four times, because he doesn\u0027t like the way it sounds. He apologizes to the crowd about that, and they laugh and cajole him, but they\u0027re not his primary concern. His primary concern is being happy with what it sounds like. There\u0027s a corollary to that bit of hard-won Bridges wisdom: You have to care about the work, and then you have to let it go. Like, for instance, R.I.P.D., a movie he starred in and which was perhaps the summer\u0027s biggest flop.\u000A\u000A \u0022I had such a great time working on that movie,\u0022 Bridges said when I asked him about it this morning. \u0022I remember what we were doing. I thought: This could be fun to see. And when I saw it, I was a little underwhelmed. For my mind, the studio made some, uh, choices that I wouldn\u0027t have made.\u0022\u000A\u000A Did you allow that to fully suck for you?\u000A\u000A \u0022It\u0027s kind of fun when the movie\u0027s coming out. It\u0027s like having a horse in the race. And they\u0027re lining up, and they\u0027re off! And you\u0027re rooting for your horse. And in this case, the jockey fell off the horse and you came in last. Ha ha ha. You know. That happens sometimes.\u0022\u000A\u000A Before we all leave the Belly Up, I go out back with Loyd Catlett, his stand-in. He and Bridges met on the set of The Last Picture Show in 1970, and they\u0027ve worked together ever since.\u000A\u000A We start talking about Jeff Bridges as he exists today vis-&amp;#xE0;-vis the guy he met forty years ago.\u000A\u000A \u0022He\u0027s always been a soul-searcher,\u0022 Catlett says. \u0022Even when he was young. Looking for his answers. Always searching. I remember this pamphlet called Daily Word. He carried it with him all the time, and every day we would read the daily word. Sue had a funny line. She said, \u0027Jeff\u0027s really into philosophy; I call it fool-osophy.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A And has that changed?\u000A\u000A \u0022Well, I wouldn\u0027t say he\u0027s changed, but I think his direction is far more clear now. We were floating, we were searching, and now he\u0027s found the things that work for him.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Sue and Loyd both skip the afterparty, which takes place at a bar called Tower 13 up in Encinitas. It\u0027s more of a dinner than an afterparty. Tables have been pulled together. The group is noisy. The younger people have drinks. A lot of the Abiders have ordered soup. Bridges, at the head, presides as the spiritual center of the group, as always. He sits in front of his Malbec looking totemic, presenting more as a haunted, heavy-browed piece of wood sculpture than animate. Every once in a while, he will surface into conversation, as when a Van Morrison song comes on.\u000A\u000A \u0022That\u0027s a concert I\u0027d want to go to,\u0022 he says, \u0022Van doing the whole Astral Weeks thing.\u0022\u000A\u000A Or giving the waitress what looks like a vintage iPod mini so she can play an album on it on the house speakers: \u0022Here\u0027s my \u0027Pod, man.\u0022\u000A\u000A Or wondering who the sweet-voiced singer on a ballad is: \u0022Who is this, man?\u0022 (Chris: \u0022It\u0027s Journey.\u0022)\u000A\u000A Or discussing the current state of pop music: \u0022Yeah, man—I followed the chick who won American Idol this year.\u0022\u000A\u000A But always he disappears again, his jaw set into an underbite, his body still, his eyes unseeing. The waitress arrives with a side salad. It takes a while, but Bridges pipes up as she looks for someone to give it to: \u0022I might have ordered that!\u0022\u000A\u000A At a moment of his own choosing, he gets up. Everyone is released from the table and breaks up into groups. Some of us head for our cars.\u000A\u000A \u0022Let me drive with you,\u0022 Bridges says to me. He knows I have a job to do, and so he\u0027s going to try to help. \u0022Maybe I have something else to say.\u0022\u000A\u000A He is silent as we pull out of the parking lot and onto the beach road. It\u0027s past two in the morning. I\u0027d guess the center of his consciousness has migrated away from the nervous forebrain into that ninth level.\u000A\u000A For some time the tape recorder picks up only the Chevy Cruze shifting gears. Finally he says something: \u0022I don\u0027t think this seat adjusts.\u0022\u000A\u000A I think it probably does, but reaching around him to find the lever would involve a lot of contact.\u000A\u000A I tell him what Sue said, that he\u0027s living out his teenage fantasy.\u000A\u000A \u0022Oh yeah,\u0022 he says. \u0022Absolutely. Nothing like having a band.\u0022\u000A\u000A But otherwise, no. He doesn\u0027t have something else to say. It\u0027s a short drive up the 101 to the hotel. The shop windows in Encinitas are all dark. Waves appear as staticky lines of gray past the beach on our left. We turn off the shore road toward the Best Western and pull up to the entrance. For a moment or two his power switch gets thrown, and his consciousness lurches down from the ninth level of consciousness and back into the sentient world: \u0022All right, Daddy-o!\u0022 Bridges says. We each tell each other to travel safely. He puts an arm around my shoulder. \u0022Hang ten.\u0022\u000A\u000A Then he retreats back into himself. He steps out of the car and is silhouetted by the floodlights above the hotel carport. Who knows if he has a room key, or even if he remembers what room it is he\u0027s staying in? But no worry, the universe is benevolent. It will take care of Jeff Bridges.\u000A\u000A Devin Friedman (@devinfriedman) is GQ\u0027s director of editorial projects.",

believe that there are nine levels of consciousness. One explanation for the apparent contradiction of Jeff Bridges&#x2014;who now, at age 63, is both among the most accomplished, consistently sought-after actors in Hollywood and, by reputation and vibe, also one of the nicest and most contented&#x2014;is that Jeff Bridges lives up there in the ninth level. The ninth level&#x2014;it&#x2019;s called, as I&#x2019;m sure you know, the <em>amala</em> consciousness&#x2014;is kind of the penthouse of the mind, and up there you&#x2019;re freed from not only all that heavy karma you&#x2019;ve accumulated in your lifetimes, but the entire thinking mind! You&#x2019;re even blissfully unaffected by the overwhelming and cosmically unimportant stream of information the pedestrian world ceaselessly sends your way. Now, while Bridges has gone Zen in his late middle age, reads some Thich Nhat Hanh and knows Ram Dass and tries to meditate every day, he does not lay claim to living in one consciousness or another. But being both part of this earth and not would help us understand this:</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.2"> For breakfast on this late-July morning, Bridges has selected a little caf&#xE9; called Swami&#x2019;s, right on the 101 in Encinitas, California. He arrives wearing comfortable jeans, canvas slip-on shoes, a kind of soft, towelly green shirt that buttons up the front. He&#x2019;s got his famously beautiful hair slicked back and wears black sunglasses. His body is big, lived in; it betrays almost no kinetic energy but instead a kind of stillness, like a giant boulder you might find while hiking in Canyonlands National Park that would cause you to contemplate the unfathomable enormity of time. Anyway, we order some breakfast and sit down. Bridges, who, just to remind you, has been playing music for fifty years and has put out two albums and wasn&#x2019;t lip-synching in <em>Crazy Heart</em>, is in Encinitas to play a show in the middle of an eight-date tour with his band, the Abiders. And <em>GQ</em>, seeing in him not only an accomplished gentleman of a certain age but also someone who, as we mention above, has attained a certain level of serious life contentment, has sought him out here to gather some wisdom. So our conversation begins, like awkward conversations at weddings have begun since time immemorial: <em>Where ya coming in from? </em></p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.3">DON&#x2019;T MISS

Uhhhhh. We came in from, uh...&quot; He laughs at this. Because it&#x2019;s funny! Isn&#x2019;t life funny when you&#x2019;re not always hung up on the cosmically unimportant stream of information the pedestrian world ceaselessly sends your way? &quot;Oh God, it all kind of blends! It&#x2019;s very tough for me to remember what we did. I want to get this right for you! So let me think. We played Laughlin, Nevada. We slept in. And then drove the four hours here. No, no, this isn&#x2019;t right. Ha!&quot; He stands up and darts off. &quot;Let me go find Chris&quot;&#x2014;his music director&#x2014;&quot;so I can answer your first question!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.9"> (He came in from Anaheim on Sunday night and had the day off yesterday.)</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.a"> Now, for some people this might be embarrassing. Or could cause a little anxiety: <em>What the fuck, am I losing my mind? </em>But not to Jeff Bridges. <em>Hey, man, let go, the invisible currents of life force will carry you! Ha ha ha! What a ride.</em> Bridges just isn&#x2019;t an anxious dude. Sitting close enough to him that you can hear him lazily ruminate his huevos rancheros confirms what you probably suspect from watching him in the movies: He might be the least anxious person in America (who has also won an Academy Award for best actor). As the film critic Pauline Kael famously wrote: Bridges &quot;may be the most natural and least self-conscious screen actor that has ever lived.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.b"> When he comes back to our outdoor table at Swami&#x2019;s, named for the famous surf break just the other side of the 101, a comment is made about his lack of anxiety. Can you just teach us all how to be a little more like that? But he says I have it wrong. Even playing his music tonight here in Encinitas will involve a struggle that goes something like this: &quot;I go through the gamut of emotions. It&#x2019;s kind of like emotional weather. Feeling anxious. You know, a lot of anxiety. And that&#x2019;ll pass. Nothing will particularly change, except something inside. And then all of a sudden I&#x2019;m saying, <em>Hey, this is fun, being alive! Look at that! Look at this!</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Listen, if you&#x2019;re going to be spending time with Bridges, you need to get comfortable analyzing your feelings.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.d"> This is the point when we get up and go inside to get something from the juice bar.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.e"> &quot;You ever had wheatgrass before?&quot; Bridges says, contemplating the menu.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.f"> &quot;No,&quot; I say. Why do I lie about having had wheatgrass before? I don&#x2019;t know. You just don&#x2019;t want to deny Jeff Bridges the pleasure of introducing you to a wonderful health beverage.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.g"> At the counter there&#x2019;s a tiny middle-aged man with a kelp bed of sun-bleached hair, sunburned eye sockets, a small puffy-lipped mouth. He&#x2019;s a fixture at Swami&#x2019;s, likes to call himself a co-owner. When he hears the conversation, he adds: &quot;You know, it&#x2019;s the microorganisms on the wheatgrass that are so amazing&#x2014;the wheatgrass itself doesn&#x2019;t do anything.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.h"> &quot;Far out, man!&quot; Bridges says.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.i"> Then it dawns on the &quot;co-owner&quot; who he&#x2019;s talking to. &quot;Hey, man!&quot; he says. &quot;Will you write on our wall, man?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.j"> &quot;I&#x2019;ll tell you what, man. Why don&#x2019;t I come back later and draw you a picture!&quot; Bridges says.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.k"> When we&#x2019;re back at the table, I bring up the topic of marriage. This is another thing he seems to have figured out. If you know anything about Bridges, one of the things you know is that he&#x2019;s been married for almost forty years, that he has spent the better part of his life<em> (a) </em>being one of the best-looking, most famous men in the world and <em>(b)</em> waking up next to the same woman he met in his twenties. But I&#x2019;m particularly interested in something wise he said in an interview not long ago: In a marriage, every fight is the same fight, over and over again, in different forms. (Note to unwed readers: In a marriage, every fight is the same fight, over and over again, in different forms.) I ask him what his version of the fight is.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.l"> &quot;I&#x2019;m gonna take a little risk here, but I think this is so,&quot; he says. He has removed his black glasses, and his light eyes almost disappear as he squints against the sun. &quot;I think that it&#x2019;s not only the same fight that you have with your spouse, but it&#x2019;s the same fight that everyone has with everyone&#x2014;<em>everyone</em>. And basically the fight is: <em>You don&#x2019;t get it</em>.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.m"> You don&#x2019;t get it?</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.n"> &quot;You don&#x2019;t get it! What is, for me, being alive. And what you do to me. And the thing is: That&#x2019;s true! I <em>don&#x2019;t</em> know how you feel, what it is to be you. But that&#x2019;s something to kind of celebrate and respect and honor! And that&#x2019;s, <em>that&#x2019;s</em> what we have in common. None of us, <em>none of us</em>, get each other. So you have to just be with that. And have a <em>relationship</em> with it. And, uh, usually what happens, if you hang with it enough, your love has to get bigger to hold that misunderstanding, that mystery.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.o"> The wheatgrass arrives. &quot;You can do it like a shot, man,&quot; he says. &quot;But I&#x2019;d just take a good swig of it.&quot; We swig together. He looks at me, knowingly: &quot;Sweet, isn&#x2019;t it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.p"> We finish our microorganisms (it&#x2019;s sweet!), and I posit something on behalf of confused married people everywhere. Isn&#x2019;t the problem that this bigger love is fundamentally different from the romantic love that gets you married in the first place? Different from the hot-sex-all-the-time love you think at first that marriage is about?</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.q"> &quot;I don&#x2019;t know, it&#x2019;s kind of both, man! It&#x2019;s pretty sexy, too, when you get into <em>that</em> stuff. When you pop that? Some good lovemaking comes out of that stuff, don&#x2019;t you think? You have a fight, and you come out of that, and you say, Jeez, I don&#x2019;t understand you, but you&#x2019;re turning me on!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.r"> When Bridges gets to describing a technique he and his wife use to communicate better&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about just letting the other person talk, uninterrupted, as long as they want without responding to or arguing with what they say&#x2014;he&#x2019;s interrupted by the approach of the straw-coiffed co-owner dude. He wants to shoot the shit a little more with Bridges.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.s"> &quot;Not now, man!&quot; Bridges says enthusiastically, motioning toward the tape recorder, which at this point only contains half of his marriage-communication method. &quot;I&#x2019;m doing a <em>thing!</em>&quot; It&#x2019;s the most genuine, least mean way a famous person can blow off a fan.<em> What I&#x2019;m doing right now is super important to me, so gimme a minute.</em></p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.t"> When the co-owner is gone, the conversation turns to fidelity. It&#x2019;s something that Bridges, having been both married and an actor on remote sets with beautiful women for a long time, has done some thinking about. He suggests that the key here isn&#x2019;t necessarily simple restraint. Take a man who becomes consumed by a desire to stray:</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.u"> &quot;Well, live and learn. Go ahead and do it, and we&#x2019;ll see how that goes.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.v"> Seriously? Just do it?</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.w"> &quot;Suppression can kind of get you into trouble, too,&quot; he says. &quot;I was reading an interesting thing&#x2014;this kind of goes with the meditation and the spiritual side of things that I&#x2019;m interested in. The difference between suppression and refraining. When you touch something hot, you don&#x2019;t have to repress the desire to touch it again.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.x"> So you think you have to touch it first?</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.y"> &quot;Sometimes you do. It&#x2019;s like that old thing about addiction, I guess. About people hitting their bottom.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.z"> What was your bottom?</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.10"> &quot;Ahh. I don&#x2019;t even want to talk about it. I don&#x2019;t want to make that a public thing. But I hit bottom.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.11"> When we&#x2019;re done with breakfast, we head across the 101 to check out the break at Swami&#x2019;s (&quot;Look at that wave on the outside! Cooool. Beautiful&quot;), and then it&#x2019;s almost noon. Bridges needs to get back to his hotel. At my car, I tell him I&#x2019;ll see him at sound check down at the venue in Solana Beach, and we shake. But then he doesn&#x2019;t seem to know what to do. He peers around the parking lot: <em>Shouldn&#x2019;t something appear right now? The means for my departure? The invisible currents of life force? </em>I offer to drive him back to the hotel, and that sounds awesome to him. But before we leave, he remembers that he made a promise to the folks at Swami&#x2019;s.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.12"> Bridges heads back inside, and the co-owner points out a bare spot on the wall where he can draw his picture. Bridges gets up on a stool and does a line drawing of a dude with a beard. Underneath it, he writes his most solemn oath:<em> DIG IT. </em></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.13"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.14">The show in Solana Beach that night goes off well. Jeff Bridges and the Abiders fill the Belly Up, a pleasant old club hewn from wood beams and hung with papier-m&amp;#xE2;ch&#xE9; sharks. He plays some songs from <em>Crazy Heart</em>, some songs of his own composition, some alt-country/dad-rock from his songwriting pals, a Tom Waits number. He&#x2019;s in the same jeans and shoes but has let his Jeff Bridges hair fall in lush layers like it does if you just give it half the chance. He&#x2019;s pretty good on the guitar and impressive on piano. Let&#x2019;s classify the crowd as<em> prosperous drunk beach-town whities</em>, and they are into the music. (Especially this one dude, late fifties, with a fat, boyish face who kind of spooks the crowd as he plays what I guess is an extremely long and pliant air guitar that also shrinks down so small he&#x2019;s essentially doing a grotesque, frenzied post-pee dick wangle.)</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.15"> But the music isn&#x2019;t the most interesting thing that&#x2019;s going on here. What&#x2019;s most interesting is the scene Bridges has constructed for himself on the tour. You&#x2019;ve got all these mellowed-out session musicians from Santa Barbara, where Bridges lives, playing around him. Jessie, his middle daughter, opens for him and sits in on a few numbers near the end, including &quot;Teach Your Children&quot;&#x2014;which he&#x2019;s singing with one of his children! Bridges has worked with the same stand-in for the past sixty-some movies&#x2014;his name is Loyd Catlett&#x2014;and he&#x2019;s here, too. And next to him Sue, Bridges&#x2019;s wife. She&#x2019;s in gold slip-on shoes with flat heels, a little green satin backpack, and glasses with sparkles inlaid on the arms, and is listening with earplugs in. What we&#x2019;re seeing here is that Bridges has lived a life of relationship continuity, and here he is at the Belly Up reaping the rewards.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.16"> Now, I&#x2019;m not saying that Jeff Bridges weaned his babies from a milk-dispensing man-brassiere and sewed calico pinafores for his three girls to wear to school. (When I catch up with Sue backstage, she teases Bridges about his parenting thusly: &quot;You can&#x2019;t screw up if you&#x2019;re not there!&quot;) But I am saying Bridges brought the full Bridges, consistent, unadulterated, to his family. Like, here he is on giving his eldest daughter away at the altar: &quot;We had a big party at our house. And to some people&#x2019;s embarrassment&#x2014;I think my daughter kind of dug it, my wife probably thought it was over the top&#x2014;I led everybody in a big om-ing</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.17"> session for about five minutes.&quot; He laughs. &quot;I thought everybody got off. But I was pretty drunk myself.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.18"> Or take Jessie, now touring with the Abiders. Before this, she&#x2019;d been doing some character building by way of working as Bridges&#x2019;s assistant on his past three films. You should hear her talk about lugging his French zero-gravity chair through the New Mexico mountains during the<em> True Grit </em>shoot: &quot;It&#x2019;s called a Lafuma, and it takes all of the pressure off your lower back. It holds you in this place where you&#x2019;re just like, <em>Ahhh</em>. Eventually I started to be like, &#x2019;I&#x2019;m not carrying that chair up another mountain.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.19"> I mention the tableau Bridges has set up for himself here on the tour, and Sue says: &quot;Oh God, it&#x2019;s great! He&#x2019;s living out his teenage fantasy!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> Really? He told you his teenage fantasy?</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> She peers scoldingly over the lenses of her glasses: &quot;We&#x2019;ve been married forty years.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> The fantasy isn&#x2019;t about role-playing and preening for people out there to get their Jeff Bridges fix, though. At one point during the show, Bridges makes the band start the same song four times, because he doesn&#x2019;t like the way it sounds. He apologizes to the crowd about that, and they laugh and cajole him, but they&#x2019;re not his primary concern. His primary concern is being happy with what it sounds like. There&#x2019;s a corollary to that bit of hard-won Bridges wisdom: You have to care about the work, and then you have to let it go. Like, for instance, <em>R.I.P.D.</em>, a movie he starred in and which was perhaps the summer&#x2019;s biggest flop.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> &quot;I had such a great time working on that movie,&quot; Bridges said when I asked him about it this morning. &quot;I remember what we were doing. I thought: This could be fun to see. And when I saw it, I was a little underwhelmed. For my mind, the studio made some, uh, choices that I wouldn&#x2019;t have made.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> Did you allow that to fully suck for you?</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> &quot;It&#x2019;s kind of fun when the movie&#x2019;s coming out. It&#x2019;s like having a horse in the race.<em> And they&#x2019;re lining up, and they&#x2019;re off!</em> And you&#x2019;re rooting for your horse. And in this case, the jockey fell off the horse and you came in last. Ha ha ha. You know. That happens sometimes.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> Before we all leave the Belly Up, I go out back with Loyd Catlett, his stand-in. He and Bridges met on the set of <em>The Last Picture Show</em> in 1970, and they&#x2019;ve worked together ever since.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1h"> We start talking about Jeff Bridges as he exists today vis-&amp;#xE0;-vis the guy he met forty years ago.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1i"> &quot;He&#x2019;s always been a soul-searcher,&quot; Catlett says. &quot;Even when he was young. Looking for his answers. Always searching. I remember this pamphlet called <em>Daily Word</em>. He carried it with him all the time, and every day we would read the daily word. Sue had a funny line. She said, &#x2019;Jeff&#x2019;s really into philosophy; I call it <em>fool</em>-osophy.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1j"> And has that changed?</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1k"> &quot;Well, I wouldn&#x2019;t say he&#x2019;s changed, but I think his direction is far more clear now. We were floating, we were searching, and now he&#x2019;s found the things that work for him.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1l"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1m"> Sue and Loyd both skip the afterparty, which takes place at a bar called Tower 13 up in Encinitas. It&#x2019;s more of a dinner than an afterparty. Tables have been pulled together. The group is noisy. The younger people have drinks. A lot of the Abiders have ordered soup. Bridges, at the head, presides as the spiritual center of the group, as always. He sits in front of his Malbec looking totemic, presenting more as a haunted, heavy-browed piece of wood sculpture than animate. Every once in a while, he will surface into conversation, as when a Van Morrison song comes on.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1n"> &quot;That&#x2019;s a concert I&#x2019;d want to go to,&quot; he says, &quot;Van doing the whole <em>Astral Weeks</em> thing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1o"> Or giving the waitress what looks like a vintage iPod mini so she can play an album on it on the house speakers: &quot;Here&#x2019;s my &#x2019;Pod, man.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1p"> Or wondering who the sweet-voiced singer on a ballad is: &quot;Who is this, man?&quot; (Chris: &quot;It&#x2019;s Journey.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1q"> Or discussing the current state of pop music: &quot;<em>Yeah</em>, man&#x2014;I followed the chick who won<em> American Idol</em> this year.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1r"> But always he disappears again, his jaw set into an underbite, his body still, his eyes unseeing. The waitress arrives with a side salad. It takes a while, but Bridges pipes up as she looks for someone to give it to: &quot;I might have ordered that!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1s"> At a moment of his own choosing, he gets up. Everyone is released from the table and breaks up into groups. Some of us head for our cars.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1t"> &quot;Let me drive with you,&quot; Bridges says to me. He knows I have a job to do, and so he&#x2019;s going to try to help. &quot;Maybe I have <em>something else to say.</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1u"> He is silent as we pull out of the parking lot and onto the beach road. It&#x2019;s past two in the morning. I&#x2019;d guess the center of his consciousness has migrated away from the nervous forebrain into that ninth level.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1v"> For some time the tape recorder picks up only the Chevy Cruze shifting gears. Finally he says something: &quot;I don&#x2019;t think this seat adjusts.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1w"> I think it probably does, but reaching around him to find the lever would involve a lot of contact.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1x"> I tell him what Sue said, that he&#x2019;s living out his teenage fantasy.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1y"> &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;Absolutely. Nothing like having a band.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.1z"> But otherwise, no. He doesn&#x2019;t have something else to say. It&#x2019;s a short drive up the 101 to the hotel. The shop windows in Encinitas are all dark. Waves appear as staticky lines of gray past the beach on our left. We turn off the shore road toward the Best Western and pull up to the entrance. For a moment or two his power switch gets thrown, and his consciousness lurches down from the ninth level of consciousness and back into the sentient world: &quot;All right, Daddy-o!&quot; Bridges says. We each tell each other to travel safely. He puts an arm around my shoulder. &quot;Hang ten.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.20"> Then he retreats back into himself. He steps out of the car and is silhouetted by the floodlights above the hotel carport. Who knows if he has a room key, or even if he remembers what room it is he&#x2019;s staying in? But no worry, the universe is benevolent. It will take care of Jeff Bridges.</p><p data-reactid=".1oyz0lysoao.1.1.0.0.4.21"> <em><a href="../contributors/devin-friedman">Devin Friedman</a> (<a
