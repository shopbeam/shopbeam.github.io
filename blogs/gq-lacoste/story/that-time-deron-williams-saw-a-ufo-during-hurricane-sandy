  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFor nearly four decades, the New Jersey Nets languished in Big Apple obscurity out in the swamps of the Meadowlands. They reached the NBA Finals twice in the early 2000s, but those appearances barely moved the New York City sports needle. If a team wins the Eastern Conference in the woods but no one\u0027s there to see it... It was something like that. Now in Brooklyn, the Nets are suddenly the league\u0027s hippest team east of Oklahoma City. Even despite a slow start, there are celebrities sitting courtside, and a contagious energy surrounding the first professional team to play in the borough since the Dodgers left in 1957. Deron Williams is the team\u0027s star. We spoke with him on Thursday:\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AGQ: So, Brooklyn, huh? Have you bought into the whole hipster lifestyle yet? \u000A\u000A We\u0027re all still getting familiar with the community, but we\u0027re excited about it. I live in Manhattan, not Brooklyn, so there hasn\u0027t been all that much change in my lifestyle. But if you\u0027re wondering, no, it\u0027s not like I\u0027ll be wearing skinny jeans anytime soon. I don\u0027t think so, at least.\u000A\u000AGQ: This offseason, you were a free agent, and you took your time deciding between your hometown Dallas Mavericks and the Brooklyn Nets. What was it like being courted by Mark Cuban? \u000A\u000A I never really spoke to Mark Cuban. There wasn\u0027t much courting, to be honest.\u000A\u000AGQ: A lot of people are fascinated by Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov. Is there a side of him that you\u0027ve seen that the rest of the world hasn\u0027t? \u000A\u000A He\u0027s laid back, man. A lot of the stuff around him is just speculation and rumors. He\u0027s a real normal guy. I promise. If you\u0027re around him for an extended period of time, you never really have any idea that he\u0027s worth $20 billion, or whatever he\u0027s worth. I went out to Russia and had dinner at his house, or compound I should say. We just ate, chilled, and hung out. He does a crazy physical workout every day. I don\u0027t know. He\u0027s really down to Earth.\u000A\u000AGQ: Are you and Jay-Z buddies? Is he the type of friend where you text him, \u0022Hey, want to grab a burger?\u0022\u000A\u000A [Laughs] We text a lot. After games, he\u0027ll send me a note. I\u0027ll text him back. Before and after games, we\u0027ll talk when he\u0027s there. We don\u0027t really talk about fantasy football or anything, but we\u0027re definitely friendly. He\u0027s cool. When my wife and I were looking for houses downtown, he was helping us out, passing along names and numbers and giving us tips on where we should be looking. When he was working on the new Nets uniforms, he was asking me for my opinion. He asked me what I thought about wearing the black uniforms at home. He didn\u0027t have to do that.\u000A\u000AGQ: Where were you during the hurricane? What was your Sandy experience like?\u000A\u000A We live in downtown Manhattan, so like everybody else downtown, we lost power around 8 p.m. on Monday, and didn\u0027t get it back until the following Saturday. We also had a whole bunch of family in town for the Nets-Knicks game, so we had about thirteen people living with us under our roof. There was nowhere we could all really go because there was no availability in any of the hotels. We had no cell reception, no power, really nothing. It was starting to get really cold. I didn\u0027t even know about all the damage that\u0027d been done until I got the power back and started catching up on everything. We had no Twitter or anything, so I didn\u0027t know the extent of what was going on in Staten Island or the Jersey Shore, or any of the other spots where got it really bad.\u000A\u000AGQ: Was there a particular \u0022New York moment\u0022 during the Hurricane? Did you see something that\u0027d made you think, \u0022That\u0027d only happen in this city,\u0022?\u000A\u000A Well, I don\u0027t know if you\u0027d call this a \u0022New York moment\u0022, but I definitely saw something I\u0027d never seen before. The night all the power went out, I was standing out on my balcony, looking outside the window. Out of nowhere, I saw this big green flash across the sky. It wasn\u0027t lightning. It looked... It looked like a UFO.\u000A\u000AGQ: Nice. What was it really?\u000A\u000A A UFO. I\u0027m telling you, man.\u000A\u000AGQ: You really think it was a UFO?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t know, man. I\u0027d never seen anything like that before.\u000A\u000AGQ: You\u0027re a big Steelers fan, yet you spent most of your childhood living in Cowboys country in Dallas. How does that even happen? \u000A\u000A I took a lot of heat for that. Always heard about that. My mother was a huge Steelers fan, so they were my team growing up. Liking the Cowboys wasn\u0027t even a thought in my house, though. My friends, my wife—they\u0027re all Cowboys fans. They played against each other in the Super Bowl when I was younger [in 1995], and that was crazy. I remember wanting to run out on to the field and choke Neil O\u0027Donnell.\u000A\u000AGQ: Everyone expects professional basketball players to have extravagant hobbies, but I\u0027m told your biggest thing is the video game \u0022Call of Duty\u0022. Is that true?\u000A\u000A [Laughs] I love it, man. I got into it a little later than a lot of the other guys, but once I started, I was hooked. The new one, \u0022Call of Duty: Black Ops II\u0022 comes out soon, and I\u0027m told there are all sorts of new features. I\u0027m not even the guy who\u0027s the most into it on the team. Gerald Wallace, it\u0027s all he does. I play with my friends and we\u0027re alright at it, but Gerald plays with like professionals. He has a whole crew of \u0022gamer friends.\u0022 He\u0027s obsessed.\u000A\u000AGQ: Lastly, an important question we\u0027ve all been wondering. If there was a zombie takeover of Brooklyn, and you had to choose one teammate—current or ex—to fight them off, who are you taking?\u000A\u000A Oh, no question. Reggie Evans. He\u0027s tough. He\u0027s crazy. He\u0027d have my back in any situation. You don\u0027t want someone who\u0027s going to run away and leave you when those zombies are coming at you. Reggie, he\u0027d be there ‘til the end. I know he\u0027d be fighting every last one with me.",

decades, the New Jersey Nets languished in Big Apple obscurity out in the swamps of the Meadowlands. They reached the NBA Finals twice in the early 2000s, but those appearances barely moved the New York City sports needle. If a team wins the Eastern Conference in the woods but no one&apos;s there to see it... It was something like that. Now in Brooklyn, the Nets are suddenly the league&apos;s hippest team east of Oklahoma City. Even despite a slow start, there are celebrities sitting courtside, and a contagious energy surrounding the first professional team to play in the borough since the Dodgers left in 1957. Deron Williams is the team&apos;s star. We spoke with him on Thursday:</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>GQ: So, Brooklyn, huh? Have you bought into the whole hipster lifestyle yet? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.5"> We&apos;re all still getting familiar with the community, but we&apos;re excited about it. I live in Manhattan, not Brooklyn, so there hasn&apos;t been all that much change in my lifestyle. But if you&apos;re wondering, no, it&apos;s not like I&apos;ll be wearing skinny jeans anytime soon. I don&apos;t think so, at least.</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>GQ: This offseason, you were a free agent, and you took your time deciding between your hometown Dallas Mavericks and the Brooklyn Nets. What was it like being courted by Mark Cuban? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.7"> I never really spoke to Mark Cuban. There wasn&apos;t much courting, to be honest.</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>GQ: A lot of people are fascinated by Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov. Is there a side of him that you&apos;ve seen that the rest of the world hasn&apos;t? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.9"> He&apos;s laid back, man. A lot of the stuff around him is just speculation and rumors. He&apos;s a real normal guy. I promise. If you&apos;re around him for an extended period of time, you never really have any idea that he&apos;s worth $20 billion, or whatever he&apos;s worth. I went out to Russia and had dinner at his house, or compound I should say. We just ate, chilled, and hung out. He does a crazy physical workout every day. I don&apos;t know. He&apos;s really down to Earth.</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>GQ: Are you and Jay-Z buddies? Is he the type of friend where you text him, &quot;Hey, want to grab a burger?&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.b"> <em>[Laughs]</em> We text a lot. After games, he&apos;ll send me a note. I&apos;ll text him back. Before and after games, we&apos;ll talk when he&apos;s there. We don&apos;t really talk about fantasy football or anything, but we&apos;re definitely friendly. He&apos;s cool. When my wife and I were looking for houses downtown, he was helping us out, passing along names and numbers and giving us tips on where we should be looking. When he was working on the new Nets uniforms, he was asking me for my opinion. He asked me what I thought about wearing the black uniforms at home. He didn&apos;t have to do that.</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>GQ: Where were you during the hurricane? What was your Sandy experience like?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.d"> We live in downtown Manhattan, so like everybody else downtown, we lost power around 8 p.m. on Monday, and didn&apos;t get it back until the following Saturday. We also had a whole bunch of family in town for the Nets-Knicks game, so we had about thirteen people living with us under our roof. There was nowhere we could all really go because there was no availability in any of the hotels. We had no cell reception, no power, really nothing. It was starting to get really cold. I didn&apos;t even know about all the damage that&apos;d been done until I got the power back and started catching up on everything. We had no Twitter or anything, so I didn&apos;t know the extent of what was going on in Staten Island or the Jersey Shore, or any of the other spots where got it really bad.</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>GQ: Was there a particular &quot;New York moment&quot; during the Hurricane? Did you see something that&apos;d made you think, &quot;That&apos;d only happen in this city,&quot;?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.f"> Well, I don&apos;t know if you&apos;d call this a &quot;New York moment&quot;, but I definitely saw something I&apos;d never seen before. The night all the power went out, I was standing out on my balcony, looking outside the window. Out of nowhere, I saw this big green flash across the sky. It wasn&apos;t lightning. It looked... It looked like a UFO.</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>GQ: Nice. What was it really?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.h"> A UFO. I&apos;m telling you, man.</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>GQ: You really think it was a UFO?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.j"> I don&apos;t know, man. I&apos;d never seen anything like that before.</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>GQ: You&apos;re a big Steelers fan, yet you spent most of your childhood living in Cowboys country in Dallas. How does that even happen? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.l"> I took a lot of heat for that. <em>Always </em>heard about that. My mother was a huge Steelers fan, so they were my team growing up. Liking the Cowboys wasn&apos;t even a thought in my house, though. My friends, my wife&#x2014;they&apos;re all Cowboys fans. They played against each other in the Super Bowl when I was younger [in 1995], and that was crazy. I remember wanting to run out on to the field and choke Neil O&apos;Donnell.</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>GQ: Everyone expects professional basketball players to have extravagant hobbies, but I&apos;m told your biggest thing is the video game &quot;Call of Duty&quot;. Is that true?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.n"> <em>[Laughs]</em> I love it, man. I got into it a little later than a lot of the other guys, but once I started, I was hooked. The new one, &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot; comes out soon, and I&apos;m told there are all sorts of new features. I&apos;m not even the guy who&apos;s the most into it on the team. Gerald Wallace, it&apos;s all he does. I play with my friends and we&apos;re alright at it, but Gerald plays with like professionals. He has a whole crew of &quot;gamer friends.&quot; He&apos;s obsessed.</p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>GQ: Lastly, an important question we&apos;ve all been wondering. If there was a zombie takeover of Brooklyn, and you had to choose one teammate&#x2014;current or ex&#x2014;to fight them off, who are you taking?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.4.p"> Oh, no question. Reggie Evans. He&apos;s tough. He&apos;s crazy. He&apos;d have my back in any situation. You don&apos;t want someone who&apos;s going to run away and leave you when those zombies are coming at you. Reggie, he&apos;d be there &#x2018;til the end. I know he&apos;d be fighting every last one with me.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".121rf01f08w.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col
