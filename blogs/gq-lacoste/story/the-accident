  	    "articleBody": "The accident—the first one—occurred on the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving of my senior year in high school. It left one friend injured and one dead, and for a while afterward the whole thing seemed so surreal and impossible that all we could do—friends, family, anyone connected but not in the accident itself—was try to re-create the simultaneities of that evening, the first person at the scene, the shock of the couple at the nearby house from which the call was made for an ambulance, and then: who called whom, and who was where when they heard. Given our own shock, we couldn\u0027t imagine the parents of the victims hearing those first words: There\u0027s been an accident....\u000A\u000AWhen the news reached my family that night, in that orbit of calls, my parents, perhaps like other parents among our friends, presumed their child might have been in the car, which wasn\u0027t the case, though might have been, had I made a different decision earlier that evening. For us seniors, it was a free night with no school the next day, a holiday from everything, including our cursed college apps. Mine was spent with my girlfriend, so I missed the pre-party and then the ride to the real party. And so I missed the accident, too.\u000A\u000AThere were two cars, belonging to Jax[*] and Flynn, driving from the beach north up through town to someone\u0027s parentless house. Riding with Jax was Seger, and with Flynn, Xavier. On a stretch of road by one of the town\u0027s country clubs, Jax lost control of his car, hit a telephone pole, and skidded a hundred feet into a tree. The crash drove the engine through the dashboard. The Jaws of Life were required to cut the bodies from the wreckage.\u000A\u000AAt that moment—as the first siren sounded, as the first numbers were dialed, as the bodies were gathered and rushed away—I was watching a movie/eating Chinese/on a bed with my girlfriend, I can\u0027t remember exactly. Lost in the oblivious haze of youth, I was certain, like millions of teenagers before me, that nothing would ever touch us there.\u000A\u000AUntil, of course, it did.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGrowing up, we had this sort of unusual thing in our town: an ambulance service operated by kids. It\u0027s still there today, in fact—thriving. Then, it was housed in a defunct red train station that rattled every time a passing commuter train rushed by on its way to Manhattan. In winter, icy gusts came lunging through the walls. There was a garage with two ambulances, and off it, a cramped radio room. Inside the station was an open common area where presumably tickets had once been sold, but which now hosted our training sessions and organizational meetings. Upstairs there was a loft where the CPR manikins were stashed. Sometimes you\u0027d forget and go up there at midnight to turn out a light and nearly have a heart attack at all those synthetic bodies laid out, staring dumbly at the ceiling.\u000A\u000AThe ambulance service had been founded in the \u002770s. It was as if some Hollywood ecs had sat around spitballing one-line pitches for after-school specials, until someone blurted, \u0022Emergency...but with kids in charge.\u0022 Of course, we had adult advisers who played a vital role—and our both tender and mercurial fiftysomething patriarch, who cursed and yelled at everyone, calling them \u0022boobie\u0022 in an attempt to gauge our toughness. And yet it was we teenagers who did the bulk of the work. We started in the radio room in ninth grade and graduated to gofer on the ambulance in tenth, then went on to become EMTs and ambulance drivers. As an experiment, the ambulance had succeeded a little too thoroughly, and by the time I came along, there were about fifty of us who worked there in one capacity or another.\u000A\u000AStill, there were those in town who wondered: Could a 16-year-old EMT (someone who had only recently learned to drive a car) really help at, let alone handle, the worst accidents? It became our job, then, to be overdiligent and professional so as not to let anyone down. On every night of the week, including weekends, holidays, and religious days, a crew was \u0022on duty\u0022 at the rickety station, where we\u0027d run through checklists, train, sit and do homework, or just flirt and shoot the shit, pimply, hormonal teenagers that we were. From 6 P.M. to midnight, we acted as first responders, clad in our \u0022whites\u0022 (a curious uniform choice for those dealing in blood) and orange fluorescent jackets. The rest of the time we carried pagers—in school, at practice, wherever. And our precious weekends were soon filled with fund-raising, chores at headquarters, and more training courses, including hours logged at a local emergency room. There, we were taught to regard each new accident with a sort of dispassionate intensity, no matter how extreme the circumstance.\u000A\u000AInitially, however, I remember a lot of time spent blowing air into those manikins, real lip to synthetic lip, thrusting palms down on fake chests loaded with thick springs, and, at the end, paper readouts issuing from a slot at the ribs, a ticker showing the peaks and valleys that gauged one\u0027s efficacy at giving CPR. Repetition made for perfection on those fake bodies, though reality, I would soon find to my dismay, could be different. When the grandfather of the boy next door keeled over on the lawn, I lined my palm up on his sternum as I\u0027d been instructed—and had succeeded at so many times before on the dummies—and with the first thrust felt three real ribs give way.\u000A\u000AWhen it came to treating victims, every kid at the ambulance had at least one call that remained indelible—maybe a multi-car crash on the highway, maybe a cardiac arrest or a house fire or a head injury—that introduced us to a world of grief we hadn\u0027t known before, that took us behind the veil of our town. I recall responding to a daytime suicide, at a house not more than a mile from my own, and when we spilled out of the ambulance and hustled through the strobes in our bright uniforms, hoping to save the overcast day, fix the wrong, piece back the body—crazy-competent mini-adults that we were—one unimpressed police officer stopped us short on the doorstep.\u000A\u000A\u0022You\u0027re not going in there,\u0022 he said. When we insisted, he exhaled an exasperated sigh and added, \u0022She slit her goddamn wrists in the tub, and you\u0027re kids, and I\u0027m not letting you in there.\u0022 I remember we protested, outraged that he\u0027d called us \u0022kids,\u0022 and we wouldn\u0027t leave the scene, waging our own quiet sit-in, until we were finally called off by an adult adviser. But even as we worked ourselves into a bruit, I had this nightmare image of a submerged naked body, blood streaming from her wrists, face twisted in some ghoulish rictus.\u000A\u000AHalf an hour later, I was sitting back in calculus, trying to figure out a derivative.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe night of the accident, I returned home from my girlfriend\u0027s house to find my parents and my 16-year-old brother sitting grimly at the kitchen table, a scene that undoubtedly played out in other kitchens across town, too. My dad, who would have been in his late forties at the time—my age now as I write this—was a business ecutive who worked long hours, seemed to have boundless energy for house projects on the weekend, and made sure we were at church each Sunday morning, where he often volunteered as a lector. My mom, a country girl transplanted to suburbia, possessed a deep reserve of patience for her four wilding boys. Among them I was the oldest, recently sprouting up an inch taller than my dad, attaining full, moody man-boy status. In that moment I knew nothing, really, and was being told nothing. My parents said they\u0027d drive me to the hospital; I said I could drive myself, but they were having none of it.\u000A\u000AAs we left to go, my brother pulled me aside. He also worked at the ambulance service and had heard that the night\u0027s on-duty crew had left the scene with two bodies. When my brother said one of them wasn\u0027t breathing, I reflexively thought, Don\u0027t let it be Jax, and repeated that in my mind, imploring some higher power as my dad drove me beneath the sodium points of light on the highway. In the zero-sum of that moment, it didn\u0027t even occur to me what the inverse meant: Let it be Seger. And how guilty I\u0027d feel for years after about it.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAs a kid, I thought my town was a wonderland. The lawns were always freshly cut, gardens overflowing with explosions of color, the blue sky etched with mystical fans of ice from the planes that came and went from New York. Somewhere out there was the wild world, but here we lived in our own disassociated nirvana, a place where a kid felt protected and free. We rode our bikes everywhere. We swung on rope swings and swam in pools or at the beach. There was nothing really to fear, so my mom set us loose out the back door each day and we raced through the woods, to some neighborhood yard where there was always a game of football or Wi&amp;#xB1;e ball raging.\u000A\u000AThere, too, lived Seger, an athletic kid with blond hair and blue eyes. I remember one year splitting time with him at quarterback on our Pop Warner football team, the little guys with good hands who conveyed the ball to bigger guys, who then tried to run through, or over, the opposing team. Later, in sixth grade, we\u0027d hung out with two neighborhood girls, meeting after school, loitering, trying out the first rehearsals of sexual attraction. He took the lead, with the confidence of one with older siblings. The louder and funnier and more kinetic he was, the more I struck a pose of dumb bewilderment.\u000A\u000AAnd then we sort of lost track of each other. He moved to Jax\u0027s neighborhood, and they became close friends. I saw him here and there but we didn\u0027t really overlap again socially until high school. By this time, he\u0027d become starting safety on the football team—but had a sentimental streak, too. Late at night, at whatever party, he could be counted on to hijack the stereo, caterwauling at the top of his lungs to one of his favorite songs: \u0022And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye....\u0022 He sang that song every time—and it became a ritual that made everyone laugh. Ah, there goes Seger again, we said. He sounds like a dying cat! Only later did we realize the irony. He\u0027d been singing about an accident all along.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAt the hospital that night, the waiting area was flooded in bright light and the stench of antiseptic. I kept replaying this disconnected memory of a summer Sunday earlier that year—the full-color positive to the stark negative of this moment—when I\u0027d gone with friends from the ambulance to a remote reservoir where swimming was illegal, the sort of prohibition that was too hard to resist. We bought beer at some shady package store and, once on the right dirt road, pulled over and climbed through a hole in the fence, then hiked into a pine-lined lake where we leapt from rocky cliffs into clear drinking water. It was one of those endless afternoons, jumping, swimming, sunbathing on the rocks, all punctuated by salty gulps of cold beer as the day unfurled, then curled back on itself. Every hour felt like a day, and I remember returning home that night, my skin still hot from the sun, feeling as if I\u0027d been gone a week.\u000A\u000ANow here we were, perched on a cold November night at what felt like a certain end, in a state of suspension, as the seconds flew. The news was eventually delivered. Seger\u0027s dad arrived, and heard for the first time about his son\u0027s death. He was handsome like his son, with a smooth face, but now his expression contorted and he let out a high-pitched keen that made us all tuck our heads lower, knotting our hands over our stomachs.\u000A\u000AAfterward we sat all night—our circle of friends—stupefied, empty. We were all more or less facsimiles of one another. We got good grades, played sports, would soon be off to decent colleges. And now we were marked, too, by this night. So we waited for the news about Jax with the same sense of dread. When the sky shifted from black to purple, someone told us to go home, that there\u0027d be more news in the morning. So we did.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWe\u0027d had a dead cat, of course—and our first dog. (R.I.P., Buttons.) There was my cousin Cindy, who drowned when we were both 5, but I\u0027d been too young to comprehend. And my dad\u0027s dad, whom I never really knew though wish I had, attached to some weird bag at the end. But the accident was the first time someone in my everyday life—someone on the bus, someone in the cafeteria, someone in my PE class—had just vanished. Up until that point, I\u0027d yet to encounter a dead body on any ambulance calls. And now Seger\u0027s death led to the shock of that other question: Was Jax going to die, too?\u000A\u000ANo, it seemed, he wasn\u0027t. The morning after the accident, he struggled back up to full consciousness. Despite severe injuries, he was able to talk to his family—and he asked to see me, too. We\u0027d been friends for nearly ten years by that point, first thrown together on a Little League baseball team. I drove back to the hospital, alone this time, wondering if he was disfigured or what he\u0027d say, the Thanksgiving Day traffic gliding with terrible normalcy.\u000A\u000AWhen I was shown into the ICU, there he lay, hooked and wired, legs in weighted traction, wearing a neck brace. He was so pale I could see a network of veins under his face. He looked as if he\u0027d just washed up on a limpid tide after the storm, having been a shipwrecked party to some unspeakable acts. His cheeks and forehead were pimpled with the buckshot of the shattered windshield. He struggled to raise his head. And I couldn\u0027t look away.\u000A\u000AWhen I\u0027d first met Jax, at second base—we played the same position—he stood spewing flecks that sparkled in the bright sun, making a Tourettic sprinkler of spit. I took note of his oversize mitt (didn\u0027t he know that besides me he was the smallest one out here?), his untucked shirt, the points of sandy hair from the ridiculous shag beneath his maroon cap. He didn\u0027t quite fit in the frame—brash, misplaced elf that he was. Off the field he wore strange moccasin-like shoes he\u0027d gotten while living in Europe.\u000A\u000AJax was a blurter, a motormouth, a fantastic nicknamer, the name capturing the thing in you that was your weakness or your greatest exposure. For instance, there was another kid we knew who spoke in chopped-up, sputtering excitement and as a young teen could often be found puttering around the Sound in his whaler, jumping waves. And so he became \u0022Hooten, Hooten, Merrily.\u0022 (I\u0027m not even sure what it meant, but it was perfect.)\u000A\u000AAnd Jax was fearless. I saw him dive madly at ungettable balls and later fly into a rage at his older brother or the class bully, scary for the fury of his attack, his willingness to sustain a hail of blows if only to land one. Once he launched himself onto the hood of a moving car, trying to reach the driver, a boyfriend of his sister\u0027s. I saw him take flight many times from the wooden, paint-peeled railing at the pier, plunging into the warm water of the Sound, his wiry body in catlike adjustment to the force of push-off, the midair moment of peace, then always that little spasm of joy as he crashed through the water\u0027s surface.\u000A\u000ANow here he was, Jax, the once mighty berserker, laid low. In legends, he would have been the knight felled by the act no one dared to make, the wading of some rough river, the arrow slung at the giant, the throwing of his body at Doom, sacrificing his life for something perhaps meaningless. But here, in suburbia, he\u0027d marked the days of our boredom by stunts and diversions, driving, say, with only his knees, to his girlfriend\u0027s, over four miles of twisty road. Or jumping from a moving boat. Or laughing that laugh that was on you and with you.\u000A\u000AEverything in life held a joke, except this, right now. He rolled his eyes, trying to focus, smacked his cracked lips, unable to produce saliva for all the painkillers mainlined through the IVs needled in his arms. His tongue was swollen. He looked frightened, diminished. \u0022I\u0027m sorry,\u0022 he said with difficulty, then fell back to his morphine pillow.\u000A\u000AThat was it. But he\u0027d needed to say it and wanted me to convey it to our friends—and beyond. Whatever had occurred on that night before Thanksgiving—and he had little to no memory of the accident—he took full responsibility for it. His eyelids fluttered shut while I stood awkwardly, watching him sink beneath the surface as if bearing witness to a drowning. Then I was shown out.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIt happens sometimes with the dead. A magnetic field builds around their absence, compelling silence—or, worse, repelling memory, driving it underground. Until, later, it rises again. And it always does: A drive past the spot in the road, or the cemetery, or the house where Seger lived—then didn\u0027t—and the recollection of a life, and the accident that claimed it, comes back in bony fingers.\u000A\u000ASo how do you pry yourself loose of the past? We were teenagers then. We knew everything—and nothing. As the story got stranger, some of us acted out in unaccountable ways. There were those who disavowed the accident entirely, while others, like me, stupidly went looking for a second accident, to re-enact—or atone for—the first.\u000A\u000AIn the days and months after Jax hit the tree, we regularly visited him in his hospital room, where uneaten meals came and went on wheels, where he floated on the fine chemicals that inhibited his pain. When their powers dimmed, you could almost feel him sinking, wincing, fighting. He couldn\u0027t move, couldn\u0027t get up to pee on his own. Already thin, he quickly lost about twenty-five pounds. He had skin grafts, gnarled, scarred, screaming-red attachments on his feet and his legs, both of which were badly broken. And yet over time, as he regained his senses one by one, he tried to create a whole life up there: nurses who laughed at his jokes, a parade of friends that revolved through. His mother and girlfriend were a ubiquitous presence, as were the wobbly Day-Glo blocks of uneaten Jell-O perched on the nearby lunch tray.\u000A\u000AOnce, several weeks after the accident, I drove by the body shop to report back on the condition of his beloved sports car, the one that he\u0027d paid for with money earned from odd jobs, as if recording the severity of a crash he knew nothing about. But he pointed to a deck of glossy photos already taken by his brother. Fanning them in my hands, I found shot after shot of the ruined car. \u0022It\u0027s still a miracle you lived,\u0022 I told him, instantly realizing the larger cliché that everything you might say in such a situation sounded clichéd, which is when I shut up about all that.\u000A\u000AOf course, Jax saw no miracle in his survival. Seger was dead, and he hadn\u0027t even been able to attend the funeral, the church pews loaded with friends who came as their own act of penance. (\u0022The cemetery is my first stop when I get out of here,\u0022 Jax kept repeating.) And there was no miracle because, he knew, someone would be made to pay.\u000A\u000AJax was a brutal realist. Hung like a tattered kite in the antibacterial blankness of his hospital room, held up by wires and sinkered lines, he awaited his fate. His body already broken, the blow would hurt less than Seger\u0027s death. But still, it was a desperate way to think. He\u0027d been reduced to an immobile fugitive whose faith rested on the fact that he would likely be charged for his friend\u0027s death.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOne other thing about the dead: With them, so, too, goes God sometimes. This is normal, I suppose, in the aftermath of tragedy: to question one\u0027s faith. But no matter how grim the circumstances, Jax never seemed to have done the same, for he was one of my few friends who didn\u0027t go—by choice or force—to church every Sunday. There\u0027d been a summer night between our sophomore and junior years when we sat out on the pier, just the two of us, Jax reeling in bluefish. After he filled a bucket with them and a school of thrashing bunkers moved on (they beat the water into a desperate froth above the blues that gave chase), we sat staring at the stars draped over everything and got into an argument about God. I said He existed; Jax said no way. We ended up in his bedroom, paging through his World Book encyclopedia as I tried to press my case with \u0022facts.\u0022 The more I jumped from one entry to another—Noah\u0027s Ark, the Ten Commandments, miracles—the more absurd my \u0022scientific inquiry\u0022 sounded.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s all made-up,\u0022 Jax said, laughing more at my stubbornness. \u0022You\u0027re never going to find proof of Him in there.\u0022\u000A\u000AAt Seger\u0027s funeral, they played another of Seger\u0027s favorite songs, with its lyric Childhood living is easy to do. People stood and said the right things. People—Seger\u0027s girlfriend and parents, family and friends—became distraught.\u000A\u000AI wanted to show some emotion, too—because he would be badly missed—but there I sat, boiling at God/no God while otherwise disembodied, bringing the dispassionate intensity of my EMT training to every detail so I could report it back to Jax. As if we were all part of one body that could be fid somehow, as if we could tick off the checklist—airway, breathing, circulation—to find the hidden ailment stuck in the left ventricle, and be saved.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASoon the enforced patterns of our quasi-martial school life reasserted themselves: We dutifully went to our classes, to physics (where the teacher prattled on about the inadequacies of highway entrance ramps, chalking on the board in a swirl of scribbles all the horrible ways you could die while entering the faster flow of traffic) and English (we were reading Gatsby now, the green light, the deadly car accident, the body in the pool) and calculus (as if to solve a proof might put the universe back together, reveal a different god). The swim season had begun, hours lost in bubbles, lap after lap staring at the black lane line of my own failing. And of course I continued riding the ambulance, showing up at random accident scenes to splint the broken femur or bandage the bloody hand.\u000A\u000AThere was a night when we were called to help a man hit by a car. He\u0027d been thrown to the side of a busy main street, bloody and covered in slushy dirt. He was drunk and belligerent, and as the cars came and went and the strobes lit his face, it slowly dawned on me that he was my old swimming coach, Mr. Wharton, a guy I really revered. When I told him who I was and reminded him that he\u0027d coached me over hundreds of hours in the pool, he tried with difficulty to look me in the eye. How many times had he pumped me up, or screamed at me in the pool to quit slacking, or celebrated a come-from-behind win, all to show he cared? But on the shoulder of the road now, unable to focus on my face let alone stand in place, he said, \u0022Why don\u0027 ya go f-f-fuck yourself!\u0022\u000A\u000AMuch more polite was the concussed kid at the ice rink who gently barfed on me when I bent over him, covering me with bilious warmth. \u0022I\u0027m sorry,\u0022 the boy mumbled.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFrom his first return to consciousness, Jax had no memory of the accident, none whatsoever, but accepted his guilt as a reflex. Of course, we, his friends, didn\u0027t care about blood-alcohol levels and toxicology tests. He\u0027d made a bad mistake, was filled with contrition, and had our instant forgiveness.\u000A\u000ABut Jax\u0027s lack of memory didn\u0027t stop the police in their investigation; it drove them deeper. What exactly had happened that night became a nagging mystery. Pils of rumor and eyewitness account began to resolve into startling coherence.\u000A\u000AFor instance, I had friends who, at the time of the accident, had just finished playing paddle tennis at the country club up the road. They\u0027d heard the loud crash, and when they came out of the parking lot, they were startled by a car moving past them. Later, when piecing it back together, they kept wondering: Why was Flynn\u0027s car driving away?\u000A\u000ABut all these things soon became clear to Jax when the police paid him that awaited visit one day in his hospital room, offering a surprising theory that went like this: On that dark stretch of twisty road, as Jax zoomed north, Flynn\u0027s car went to pass, bumping the rear left panel of Jax\u0027s car, which sent him careening off a telephone pole, into the protracted skid that listed left to right and hurtled his car into the tree.\u000A\u000ACould it have been true?\u000A\u000AWhen confronted with the theory, Jax was incredulous. According to the police transcript from the taped interview, he said, \u0022I don\u0027t think any of my friends would do that.... First of all, [Flynn] and I are damn good friends.\u0022\u000A\u000A(Beneath the fusillade of his verbal assaults, one of Jax\u0027s greatest redeeming traits was that he saw those in his inner circle as figures of unimpeachable character, as loyal as he. For all the sport he made of us—and we of him—he was absolutely blind to the deeper stamp of one\u0027s defect. His belief in his friends was so complete it verged on naïveté.)\u000A\u000ASometime around Christmas, however, Flynn\u0027s car was impounded, and the police would later say that paint found on its front fender seemed to match the color of Jax\u0027s car. By spring, Flynn had been charged with negligent homicide, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, and evading responsibility. The narrative that had Jax in a moment of singular teenage elation and irresponsibility now opened to another possibility: two cars traveling at a high rate of speed when one car passed on a tight turn and drove the other off the road. Or this: Flynn\u0027s car passing without warning. That is, as much as Jax had screwed up, maybe it hadn\u0027t been all his fault in the end.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASo much of what happened in my town—the ancient town I knew and loved, the sprinkler-fed garden that existed during the Reagan Pleistocene in one of the outer rings around Manhattan—was never spoken of, or if so, only in whispered gossip. Affairs, eating disorders, teenage pregnancy, trips to rehab: Everybody seemed to know everybody\u0027s business, but it was cloaked and closeted. No matter how egregious or boorish the behavior or betrayal, to say it out loud, to reveal it beyond the social circle for which it was meant, was an affront almost as egregious. Every scarlet letter was partially hidden.\u000A\u000AThis is true of many places, or perhaps true of every place. No small shame accompanies the moment when our failings are made public—and it\u0027s with tense, bated breath that most wait for the unpleasantness to go away. However unsettling the news, a year or two or three and it can be relegated to the snowdrift of memory and then forgotten, replaced by the new drama of the day.\u000A\u000AAs a child, I found this disorienting. The parents were whispering about something, something with intimations of pain or dread, dark fairy tales of some sort, but what?\u000A\u000AThe charges against Flynn made the story uncomfortably public, and soon the paper ran a long article detailing the events of that night before Thanksgiving; the strained, surreal situation at our high school of friends trying to pick sides, or figure out what to believe in the first place; and the tragedy of alcohol-related car accidents in our town. Was it suburban privilege, or our access to cars, or the dark, winding roads? The police captain was quoted as saying that over the course of the past three years, a dozen young residents had died in automobile crashes. The pastor said he\u0027d never seen such \u0022tragedy with youth.\u0022 The leader of a youth religious group claimed, \u0022There\u0027s nothing but victims.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOne night during our monthly organizational meeting at the ambulance service, in a room packed with fifty kids—everything coming to a standstill at twenty-minute intervals as another commuter train roared by—I found myself launching a prayer, the first, really, since the night of the accident. This particular evening included the awarding of special gold stars, reserved for the members of a particular crew for an exceptional call, our version of the Medal of Honor. This crew, as I remember it, had responded to a very bad crash on the interstate, had performed CPR under harrowing circumstances, and had brought someone back to life.\u000A\u000ATo be so recognized was the pinnacle, to have your name called to come down and receive a star from the ambulance service\u0027s founder, to be so distinguished for heroics among your own hypercompetent, wildly applauding peers. (We all knew they\u0027d seen and done something we both hoped to and hoped not to.) It meant that for at least that moment the prophecy was true: You were so good, in fact, that you could raise the dead.\u000A\u000ADear God, I found myself praying, give me something horrible and bloody. Let my next call be a multiple-car crash with gasoline glugging all over the highway, or a cardiac arrest in a house fire, or a kid electrocuted on the railroad tracks. Let it be a shark attack or an alien invasion, whatever makes the best movie. Whatever is the most impossibly fucked-up, Lord. Just let me lay my hands on some big, honking, metal-twisted tragedy, so I can work my own miracle this time.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AJax came out of the hospital with snow on the ground, then convalesced at home for a while. When the police asked to talk to him, he went without his lawyers, against their advice, and tried to answer what he could about the accident. Eventually he returned to school on crutches, which later gave way to this clunky stimulating device he\u0027d sometimes wrap around his leg and plug into the wall, what we called his \u0022bone machine.\u0022 He hobbled the same halls as Flynn, but they studiously avoided each other now while the various lawyers prepared for the criminal trial. Meanwhile, it seemed clear that Seger\u0027s family would bring a civil suit of some sort, perhaps against all the boys. But at least on the surface, everything carried on, despite the awkwardness. College applications were completed and sent out; no one got dumped by his girlfriend.\u000A\u000ATime accelerated. The snow melted, the season changed, and our town bloomed: daffodils and forsythia at Easter, the dogwoods and cherry trees not long after. Lawns turned green again, the leaves drawing lush curtains over everything. The pier was repainted; boats were put back in the Sound, their sails snapping in the wind.\u000A\u000AWith the passage of time, Jax doubled his efforts to retrieve some shard of absent memory. The most important night of his life to that point and he couldn\u0027t remember anything but leaving Seger\u0027s house to go to a party. It was some cruel, cosmic joke. His antipathies, guided inward by guilt, now had an outward target. When Flynn pleaded not guilty to the charges, reiterating through his lawyers that he hadn\u0027t been at the accident scene that night—a version of events backed by Xavier—Jax became animated again. As they maintained their innocence, Jax\u0027s fury grew.\u000A\u000AIt was simple: Knowing what Jax believed they knew, how could they have left him there? And where had they gone?\u000A\u000AIt was hard for him to concentrate on anything but the accident—it all went back to that stretch of road. We drove it every night, in our minds. And Jax tortured himself with trying to remember. Eventually, in conversation with his doctors, it was agreed that he would visit a Yale psychiatrist who used hypnotism. It was maybe something Jax would have once regarded skeptically, but what other choice did he have?\u000A\u000AThe session lasted nearly two hours. He left the psychiatrist\u0027s office not knowing anything, hypnotized as he was—nor did his parents. The psychiatrist promised that after reviewing the videotape, he\u0027d send it along. Jax could only confirm what the psychiatrist had said, that things had gone \u0022very well,\u0022 whatever that meant.\u000A\u000AA few weeks later the videotape arrived. Jax called, I drove down to his house, and we joined his parents to watch it for the first time. When Jax appeared on the television screen—or what I remember of Jax on that screen—he sat straight up, wearing a button-down shirt. His eyes were shut, and he seemed fairly relad, answering some basic opening questions. He was apparently already hypnotized, and the psychiatrist pointed out a needle stuck halfway into the flesh between his thumb and pointer finger, though Jax said he felt no pain and seemed to have no knowledge of the pin.\u000A\u000AThe psychiatrist then asked Jax to navigate the first four-fifths of the night in question. Jax described how Seger had loaded in with Jax at Seger\u0027s house, riding shotgun, how Flynn and Xavier followed in the other car. Jax led them up Ocean to Main, Main to Birch, Birch to the high school. Then the two cars emptied through the high school parking lot, turned left onto Coral, and took a right onto High. At this point, they were a quarter mile from the tree.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIn the videotape, Jax, whose eyes are closed but tracking beneath the lids, seems at ease charting their progress. The psychiatrist leads him slowly, asks him to regard the action as though it\u0027s \u0022a photograph.\u0022 Jax is talking to Seger, music on the radio, streetlights passing in longer intervals now, the speedometer needling: twenty, twenty-five, thirty... Then he\u0027s on the straightaway before the curve with the maple tree, and the psychiatrist says, \u0022Concentrate on your rearview mirror.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere are leaves skittering, dark branches overhead, a wedge of light before the sports car. He reaches to turn up the music, presses the gas. The lights are reflecting in the rearview mirror, the other car right on his tail. He is talking to Seger.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s talking to Seger. The music is blaring. Leaves are skittering. The road takes a turn. Music, leaves, dark branches. Seconds from hitting the tree, he looks in the rearview mirror, answers the psychiatrist. \u0022I see [Flynn\u0027s] car,\u0022 he says, \u0022see him cut out left. He\u0027s getting closer. What\u0027s he doing?\u0022 For the first time, he seems to be talking not to the psychiatrist but to himself. \u0022He\u0027s almost parallel,\u0022 he says. \u0022There\u0027s no way.\u0022\u000A\u000AHis eyes shut tight. He looks stricken, thin lips pressed together. And then his body rocks once, very hard.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADid it happen like this? [**] If you\u0027d seen the tape, you might have thought so. At the very least, it gave Jax a narrative to which he could finally cling as the courts began to parse the evidence of what had occurred that night.\u000A\u000AFirst came the criminal charges against Flynn that hovered over him for a year, ending in a courtroom drama that found Jax hobbling in on crutches and Flynn home from college accompanied to court by a dozen family members. Despite several eyewitnesses placing Flynn\u0027s car near the scene after a loud crash, the prosecutor admitted that it was \u0022a difficult case to evaluate\u0022 and decided not to prosecute. He said his decision was based on the lack of reliability of Jax\u0027s account under hypnosis, (especially since the theory that Flynn\u0027s car bumped his had initially been advanced by police), and the judge dismissed the case. Outside the courtroom, Flynn\u0027s lawyer said the ruling \u0022completely vindicates my client\u0022 and that Flynn was headed immediately back to college.\u000A\u000AIn the wake of that dismissal came an array of civil suits that dragged along for years, yet after Jax\u0027s and Flynn\u0027s lawyers settled with Seger\u0027s family (for $100,000 and $300,000, respectively), everything whittled down to one: Jax suing Flynn for damages.\u000A\u000ANearly four years later, the newspapers covered that trial blow by blow. On the stand, Flynn testified that they\u0027d been drinking 7-Up and vodka at Seger\u0027s house, detailing the route of his travels, which was nearly the same as Jax\u0027s, claiming he\u0027d never seen an accident and only learned about it twenty minutes later, after arriving at the party. Under cross-examination, when questioned about the possibly matching color of paint found on the fender of his car, he said, \u0022I never hit his car before, nor any other...car.\u0022 The paint smear, the director of the state\u0027s forensics laboratory testified, was \u0022similar, but possibly not the same.\u0022 There wasn\u0027t enough paint to allow a more complete analysis. Other details emerged: They\u0027d begun drinking around 6 P.M. and left for the party around 9:30. At an intersection well before the site of the accident, Xavier had jumped out of Flynn\u0027s car and run ahead to Jax\u0027s for matches, after which they traveled several lengths behind Jax before pulling away along a road leading to the party. Another eyewitness reportedly emerged, who testified that she had seen only Jax\u0027s speeding car near the scene moments before hearing the crash. In the end the jury found Flynn \u0022negligent, but not responsible\u0022 and awarded no damages.\u000A\u000AIt was senior year, 17 years old, the soccer and football season just over, a party in the offing. Could life have been any better?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAt the end of the school year, just before prom, my prayer was answered: On a humid, cloudy night, I got my call. Already I\u0027d racked up my cardiac arrest (that neighbor of ours) and a chaotic highway accident (an unsatisfactory broken femur), but this sounded promisingly bad.\u000A\u000AWe were summoned to a vast seawater farm, with its rocky hillocks and ancient oaks, a place we knew for its Revolutionary War battles and midnight cow-toppling. This night, however, the darkness was almost a substance, and even as we directed our spotlight up into the trees, the rays were absorbed, leaving nothing to see. Eventually we came upon a car on the shoulder with its hazards blinking, someone who had witnessed the accident and rushed to help. The ambulance stopped, and I jumped out.\u000A\u000AThe way I\u0027d dreamed it always involved saving someone. I would perform some suitable miracle, and later, in the most ridiculous part of the fantasy, my victim and I would become friends, exchange gifts, and if she was pretty, maybe get married, her wheelchair being proof that I\u0027d snatched her from sure death. Now I ran over soggy ground to the car. I shone a flashlight over boulders and downed branches. The car was off in the trees, sitting a couple of feet back from the gnarled trunk of an oak, the hood accordioned to half its normal size. The driver\u0027s door was ajar, and a dark figure loomed in back, the Good Samaritan trying to pull and hold traction from his awkward angle.\u000A\u000ADespite his best efforts, the woman\u0027s head still lay facedown on the steering wheel. I could smell gasoline and manure—and gin and beer. I, too, was in an awkward spot, down on one knee inside the open front door. I positioned the flashlight on the dash, and then, as I placed my hands over each side of her head, over her ears, with both my pinkies lifting from below her jaw, her face rose before me. Her skin was soft to touch, but she was badly bloodied, and her nose, where there had been one, was now just a piece of bone. There was a clean hole in her forehead, and something green and gooey seeped out. Her eyes, half shut, were white. She was groaning softly, rhythmically, the kind of groan that reflected a pain so deep it may not have been felt consciously.\u000A\u000AI regretted my decision the minute I made it. And now we were stuck together.\u000A\u000AIt was going to be a long time before we could move her—we were going to need the Jaws of Life to get her out—let alone before she would see an emergency room. The girl or woman, maybe in her mid-twenties, had hit the tree going very fast, fast enough for her skull to have been punctured and brain matter to have seeped out.\u000A\u000AI can recall a lot about the minutiae of that night, about how the firefighters arrived, lighting huge spots on the car, making it seem like day in that glade, and then the whining of the saw as they cut her out. Another ambulance arrived, with grown-up paramedics authorized to administer drugs, which they did, running lines from drip bags to the veins in her arms. There must have been two dozen people working, spectating, helping, at the height of the action. And then, after they cut her loose, I remember standing on the back runner of the grown-up ambulance, standing there as they sheared the clothes from her body—her skin was pale, her breasts full—and put in more lines and an oxygen mask over her face, trying to stabilize her before leaving for the hospital.\u000A\u000AAfterward, when the grown-up ambulance went screaming off, everyone took their things and quickly retreated. We were pretty shook up; someone on our crew was crying. The woman was in a deep vegetative state, on her way to death by morning. And we\u0027d done nothing to change that. I myself came closest to a feeling when the clouds parted and the moonlight came down over everything, including the serrated wreckage, in thick, pale, silver beams, a moment that could have been godly but was nothing of the sort. The feeling was of betrayal and shock.\u000A\u000ANow whenever my mind slips to such naive meditations—these mock-heroic dreams of saving anyone from anything—I need only conjure that girl\u0027s face in my hands again. I need only hold that unmendable body close to realize how far I\u0027d traveled from Thanksgiving. I got what I\u0027d wished for, and I wanted to give it all back.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOne last memory of that night: When I came home in my ambulance whites and orange fluorescent jacket, splatters of blood on my sneakers, my father was sitting at the kitchen table, his work arrayed before him in scribbles on the yellow legal pads he favored. I gave him a few details, leaving out the part about when the girl\u0027s parents showed up at the scene.\u000A\u000A\u0022It sounds pretty bad,\u0022 he said.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, it was,\u0022 I said.\u000A\u000AThere was a pause, a long one. I couldn\u0027t look him in the eyes for fear it would all come out, all at once, in a great overwhelming gush, everything I\u0027d held down. He might have already understood this. But I\u0027d spent the year arming and armoring myself, and no one dared to approach anymore.\u000A\u000AMy father sat at the table, his face registering a father\u0027s concern. If he had something he needed to say—or a question to ask—he thought better of it. Or I cut him off, on my own at last. \u0022Good night,\u0022 I said, putting my foot on the first step of the back stairway leading to my room, unmoving for a moment, then shifting my weight heavily to climb.\u000A\u000A\u0022Good night, son,\u0022 said my father.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThis past Thanksgiving marked the thirty-third anniversary of Jax\u0027s car accident and of Seger\u0027s death. For a long time after-ward, you could see scars of the wreck on the trunk of the maple tree they hit, written in what seemed like Sanskrit. It was hard to look at; but for the few marks, the tree itself seemed to flourish, carrying no memory of that night.\u000A\u000AOver time, the enormous trunk healed itself, its bark without blemish, and then one day it was simply chainsawed to widen the sidewalk. In all those years that the tree had loomed there—blooming its gaudy leaves in the spring, losing them like discarded twenties in the fall—I\u0027d pass by searching for evidence that the accident had actually happened, that it hadn\u0027t just been a dream. My attitude was coldly forensic. I often thought to stop and touch the markings like an archaeologist, though never did. When the tree suddenly vanished—only pale sawdust littered the spot—there came this rush of feeling: sorrow, elation, guilt.\u000A\u000AIn the years after, Jax built a hectic, successful career in finance. Sometimes, when visiting home, I might drop in to find him hungover on a Sunday, on the couch beneath a blanket, watching old horror films. Eventually, some time after the rest of us, he married and had children. A few years back, when I told him I wanted to write something about the accident, he said, \u0022Write the truth, then.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt took a long while, because as I found, the magnetic field around the dead really does repel memory at first. But once I let it all back in, I couldn\u0027t shake Seger, the one who couldn\u0027t speak at all, the one who was suddenly everywhere. One newspaper article from the time of the civil trial detailed the courtroom testimony of a financial expert who was asked to assess the amount of money Seger might have generated in his life. The expert said $1.3 million was a fair guess, which would amount to about $2.8 million today, but it seemed all the more tragic to reduce his life to a number like that. Give us any other number: YouTube videos sent or dogs owned, favors for neighbors or baby pictures e-mailed. Before the rock closed over the vault, I wish someone had speculated about what he\u0027d found that night —God or no God—when he passed through the tree.\u000A\u000APerhaps we really are surrounded by the past, made prisoners of it. No matter how far we travel, how hard we try to forget, the scarred tree forever stands by the side of the road, if only in our minds. The only way to drive by is to set the past straight, once and for all, by remembering.\u000A\u000ATalking to my brother, a lawyer now with kids of his own, I ask what he recalls about that night, and he says two things: (1) that the EMT from our ambulance service had told him something he couldn\u0027t ever forget, that Seger had been found with a shard of glass in his eye; and (2) that I had originally planned to join Jax and the rest of them on that evening, prior to the party.\u000A\u000AAnd maybe if I had, I would have missed the opportunity to write this down, as I have, which is the only way I can make sense of anything or realize ultimately that there\u0027s no sense to be made of it: that once upon a time in a faraway town, we grew up—and some of us lived. And some of us tried to turn away but never quite could.\u000A\u000ABut most of all, if I\u0027d been there that night, I couldn\u0027t tell you now that Jax, my old friend, can still be a beautiful pain in the ass and the truest person I\u0027ll know. If I were never to see him again, this would be my memory of him, of that year: the bucket full of blues, the encyclopedia without God, the energy of his wiry body flying, bowed in the sun, trying to remember why he ever wanted to leave this earth in the first place.\u000A\u000A[*] Names have been changed throughout.\u000A\u000A[**] This section has been updated to reflect additional information regarding the criminal charges and civil litigation related to the accident.\u000A\u000AMICHAEL PATERNITI is a GQ correspondent.

series on the ways accidents shape our lives,* is the tale of how a fatal car crash shatters a small town and a group of friends one evening long ago. Now, thirty-plus years later, Michael Paterniti finally tells the tale</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.0"><strong>The accident&#x2014;the first one</strong>&#x2014;occurred on the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving of my senior year in high school. It left one friend injured and one dead, and for a while afterward the whole thing seemed so surreal and impossible that all we could do&#x2014;friends, family, anyone connected but not in the accident itself&#x2014;was try to re-create the simultaneities of that evening, the first person at the scene, the shock of the couple at the nearby house from which the call was made for an ambulance, and then: who called whom, and who was where when they heard. Given our own shock, we couldn&#x2019;t imagine the parents of the victims hearing those first words: <em>There&#x2019;s been an accident....</em></p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1">When the news reached my family that night, in that orbit of calls, my parents, perhaps like other parents among our friends, presumed their child might have been in the car, which wasn&#x2019;t the case, though might have been, had I made a different decision earlier that evening. For us seniors, it was a free night with no school the next day, a holiday from everything, including our cursed college apps. Mine was spent with my girlfriend, so I missed the pre-party and then the ride to the real party. And so I missed the accident, too.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2">There were two cars, belonging to Jax[*] and Flynn, driving from the beach north up through town to someone&#x2019;s parentless house. Riding with Jax was Seger, and with Flynn, Xavier. On a stretch of road by one of the town&#x2019;s country clubs, Jax lost control of his car, hit a telephone pole, and skidded a hundred feet into a tree. The crash drove the engine through the dashboard. The Jaws of Life were required to cut the bodies from the wreckage.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.3">At that moment&#x2014;as the first siren sounded, as the first numbers were dialed, as the bodies were gathered and rushed away&#x2014;I was watching a movie/eating Chinese/on a bed with my girlfriend, I can&#x2019;t remember exactly. Lost in the oblivious haze of youth, I was certain, like millions of teenagers before me, that nothing would ever touch us there.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.5">Until, of course, it did.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.6"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Growing up,</strong> we had this sort of unusual thing in our town: an ambulance service operated by kids. It&#x2019;s still there today, in fact&#x2014;thriving. Then, it was housed in a defunct red train station that rattled every time a passing commuter train rushed by on its way to Manhattan. In winter, icy gusts came lunging through the walls. There was a garage with two ambulances, and off it, a cramped radio room. Inside the station was an open common area where presumably tickets had once been sold, but which now hosted our training sessions and organizational meetings. Upstairs there was a loft where the CPR manikins were stashed. Sometimes you&#x2019;d forget and go up there at midnight to turn out a light and nearly have a heart attack at all those synthetic bodies laid out, staring dumbly at the ceiling.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.8">The ambulance service had been founded in the &#x2019;70s. It was as if some Hollywood ecs had sat around spitballing one-line pitches for after-school specials, until someone blurted, &quot;<em>Emergency...</em>but with kids in charge.&quot; Of course, we had adult advisers who played a vital role&#x2014;and our both tender and mercurial fiftysomething patriarch, who cursed and yelled at everyone, calling them &quot;boobie&quot; in an attempt to gauge our toughness. And yet it was we teenagers who did the bulk of the work. We started in the radio room in ninth grade and graduated to gofer on the ambulance in tenth, then went on to become EMTs and ambulance drivers. As an experiment, the ambulance had succeeded a little too thoroughly, and by the time I came along, there were about fifty of us who worked there in one capacity or another.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.9">Still, there were those in town who wondered: Could a 16-year-old EMT (someone who had only recently learned to drive a car) really help at, let alone handle, the worst accidents? It became our job, then, to be overdiligent and professional so as not to let anyone down. On every night of the week, including weekends, holidays, and religious days, a crew was &quot;on duty&quot; at the rickety station, where we&#x2019;d run through checklists, train, sit and do homework, or just flirt and shoot the shit, pimply, hormonal teenagers that we were. From 6 P.M. to midnight, we acted as first responders, clad in our &quot;whites&quot; (a curious uniform choice for those dealing in blood) and orange fluorescent jackets. The rest of the time we carried pagers&#x2014;in school, at practice, wherever. And our precious weekends were soon filled with fund-raising, chores at headquarters, and more training courses, including hours logged at a local emergency room. There, we were taught to regard each new accident with a sort of dispassionate intensity, no matter how extreme the circumstance.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.a">Initially, however, I remember a lot of time spent blowing air into those manikins, real lip to synthetic lip, thrusting palms down on fake chests loaded with thick springs, and, at the end, paper readouts issuing from a slot at the ribs, a ticker showing the peaks and valleys that gauged one&#x2019;s efficacy at giving CPR. Repetition made for perfection on those fake bodies, though reality, I would soon find to my dismay, could be different. When the grandfather of the boy next door keeled over on the lawn, I lined my palm up on his sternum as I&#x2019;d been instructed&#x2014;and had succeeded at so many times before on the dummies&#x2014;and with the first thrust felt three real ribs give way.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.b">When it came to treating victims, every kid at the ambulance had at least one call that remained indelible&#x2014;maybe a multi-car crash on the highway, maybe a cardiac arrest or a house fire or a head injury&#x2014;that introduced us to a world of grief we hadn&#x2019;t known before, that took us behind the veil of our town. I recall responding to a daytime suicide, at a house not more than a mile from my own, and when we spilled out of the ambulance and hustled through the strobes in our bright uniforms, hoping to save the overcast day, fix the wrong, piece back the body&#x2014;crazy-competent mini-adults that we were&#x2014;one unimpressed police officer stopped us short on the doorstep.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.c">&quot;You&#x2019;re not going in there,&quot; he said. When we insisted, he exhaled an exasperated sigh and added, &quot;She slit her goddamn wrists in the tub, and you&#x2019;re kids, and I&#x2019;m not letting you in there.&quot; I remember we protested, outraged that he&#x2019;d called us &quot;kids,&quot; and we wouldn&#x2019;t leave the scene, waging our own quiet sit-in, until we were finally called off by an adult adviser. But even as we worked ourselves into a bruit, I had this nightmare image of a submerged naked body, blood streaming from her wrists, face twisted in some ghoulish rictus.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.d">Half an hour later, I was sitting back in calculus, trying to figure out a derivative.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.e"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fbc309f0bee56440c213/master/w_768/life-2015-03-the-accident-the-accident-gq-magazine-march-2015-02.jpg" alt="life-2015-03-the-accident-the-accident-gq-magazine-march-2015-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-accident&amp;t=life-2015-03-the-accident-the-accident-gq-magazine-march-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-accident&amp;t=life-2015-03-the-accident-the-accident-gq-magazine-march-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-accident&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbc309f0bee56440c213%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-03-the-accident-the-accident-gq-magazine-march-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-03-the-accident-the-accident-gq-magazine-march-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-accident&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fbc309f0bee56440c213%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flife-2015-03-the-accident-the-accident-gq-magazine-march-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=life-2015-03-the-accident-the-accident-gq-magazine-march-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.f"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>The night of the accident</strong>, I returned home from my girlfriend&#x2019;s house to find my parents and my 16-year-old brother sitting grimly at the kitchen table, a scene that undoubtedly played out in other kitchens across town, too. My dad, who would have been in his late forties at the time&#x2014;my age now as I write this&#x2014;was a business ecutive who worked long hours, seemed to have boundless energy for house projects on the weekend, and made sure we were at church each Sunday morning, where he often volunteered as a lector. My mom, a country girl transplanted to suburbia, possessed a deep reserve of patience for her four wilding boys. Among them I was the oldest, recently sprouting up an inch taller than my dad, attaining full, moody man-boy status. In that moment I knew nothing, really, and was being told nothing. My parents said they&#x2019;d drive me to the hospital; I said I could drive myself, but they were having none of it.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.h">As we left to go, my brother pulled me aside. He also worked at the ambulance service and had heard that the night&#x2019;s on-duty crew had left the scene with two bodies. When my brother said one of them wasn&#x2019;t breathing, I reflexively thought, <em>Don&#x2019;t let it be Jax,</em> and repeated that in my mind, imploring some higher power as my dad drove me beneath the sodium points of light on the highway. In the zero-sum of that moment, it didn&#x2019;t even occur to me what the inverse meant: <em>Let it be Seger</em>. And how guilty I&#x2019;d feel for years after about it.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.i"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>As a kid,</strong> I thought my town was a wonderland. The lawns were always freshly cut, gardens overflowing with explosions of color, the blue sky etched with mystical fans of ice from the planes that came and went from New York. Somewhere out there was the wild world, but here we lived in our own disassociated nirvana, a place where a kid felt protected and free. We rode our bikes everywhere. We swung on rope swings and swam in pools or at the beach. There was nothing really to fear, so my mom set us loose out the back door each day and we raced through the woods, to some neighborhood yard where there was always a game of football or Wi&amp;#xB1;e ball raging.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.k">There, too, lived Seger, an athletic kid with blond hair and blue eyes. I remember one year splitting time with him at quarterback on our Pop Warner football team, the little guys with good hands who conveyed the ball to bigger guys, who then tried to run through, or over, the opposing team. Later, in sixth grade, we&#x2019;d hung out with two neighborhood girls, meeting after school, loitering, trying out the first rehearsals of sexual attraction. He took the lead, with the confidence of one with older siblings. The louder and funnier and more kinetic he was, the more I struck a pose of dumb bewilderment.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.l">And then we sort of lost track of each other. He moved to Jax&#x2019;s neighborhood, and they became close friends. I saw him here and there but we didn&#x2019;t really overlap again socially until high school. By this time, he&#x2019;d become starting safety on the football team&#x2014;but had a sentimental streak, too. Late at night, at whatever party, he could be counted on to hijack the stereo, caterwauling at the top of his lungs to one of his favorite songs: <em>&quot;And them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye....&quot;</em> He sang that song every time&#x2014;and it became a ritual that made everyone laugh. <em>Ah, there goes Seger again,</em> we said. <em>He sounds like a dying cat!</em> Only later did we realize the irony. He&#x2019;d been singing about an accident all along.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.m"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>At the hospital</strong> that night, the waiting area was flooded in bright light and the stench of antiseptic. I kept replaying this disconnected memory of a summer Sunday earlier that year&#x2014;the full-color positive to the stark negative of this moment&#x2014;when I&#x2019;d gone with friends from the ambulance to a remote reservoir where swimming was illegal, the sort of prohibition that was too hard to resist. We bought beer at some shady package store and, once on the right dirt road, pulled over and climbed through a hole in the fence, then hiked into a pine-lined lake where we leapt from rocky cliffs into clear drinking water. It was one of those endless afternoons, jumping, swimming, sunbathing on the rocks, all punctuated by salty gulps of cold beer as the day unfurled, then curled back on itself. Every hour felt like a day, and I remember returning home that night, my skin still hot from the sun, feeling as if I&#x2019;d been gone a week.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.o">Now here we were, perched on a cold November night at what felt like a certain end, in a state of suspension, as the seconds flew. The news was eventually delivered. Seger&#x2019;s dad arrived, and heard for the first time about his son&#x2019;s death. He was handsome like his son, with a smooth face, but now his expression contorted and he let out a high-pitched keen that made us all tuck our heads lower, knotting our hands over our stomachs.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.p">Afterward we sat all night&#x2014;our circle of friends&#x2014;stupefied, empty. We were all more or less facsimiles of one another. We got good grades, played sports, would soon be off to decent colleges. And now we were marked, too, by this night. So we waited for the news about Jax with the same sense of dread. When the sky shifted from black to purple, someone told us to go home, that there&#x2019;d be more news in the morning. So we did.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.q"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>We&#x2019;d had a dead cat</strong>, of course&#x2014;and our first dog. (R.I.P., Buttons.) There was my cousin Cindy, who drowned when we were both 5, but I&#x2019;d been too young to comprehend. And my dad&#x2019;s dad, whom I never really knew though wish I had, attached to some weird bag at the end. But the accident was the first time someone in my everyday life&#x2014;someone on the bus, someone in the cafeteria, someone in my PE class&#x2014;had just vanished. Up until that point, I&#x2019;d yet to encounter a dead body on any ambulance calls. And now Seger&#x2019;s death led to the shock of that other question: Was Jax going to die, too?</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.s">No, it seemed, he wasn&#x2019;t. The morning after the accident, he struggled back up to full consciousness. Despite severe injuries, he was able to talk to his family&#x2014;and he asked to see me, too. We&#x2019;d been friends for nearly ten years by that point, first thrown together on a Little League baseball team. I drove back to the hospital, alone this time, wondering if he was disfigured or what he&#x2019;d say, the Thanksgiving Day traffic gliding with terrible normalcy.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.t">When I was shown into the ICU, there he lay, hooked and wired, legs in weighted traction, wearing a neck brace. He was so pale I could see a network of veins under his face. He looked as if he&#x2019;d just washed up on a limpid tide after the storm, having been a shipwrecked party to some unspeakable acts. His cheeks and forehead were pimpled with the buckshot of the shattered windshield. He struggled to raise his head. And I couldn&#x2019;t look away.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.u">When I&#x2019;d first met Jax, at second base&#x2014;we played the same position&#x2014;he stood spewing flecks that sparkled in the bright sun, making a Tourettic sprinkler of spit. I took note of his oversize mitt (didn&#x2019;t he know that besides me he was the smallest one out here?), his untucked shirt, the points of sandy hair from the ridiculous shag beneath his maroon cap. He didn&#x2019;t quite fit in the frame&#x2014;brash, misplaced elf that he was. Off the field he wore strange moccasin-like shoes he&#x2019;d gotten while living in Europe.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.v">Jax was a blurter, a motormouth, a fantastic nicknamer, the name capturing the thing in you that was your weakness or your greatest exposure. For instance, there was another kid we knew who spoke in chopped-up, sputtering excitement and as a young teen could often be found puttering around the Sound in his whaler, jumping waves. And so he became &quot;Hooten, Hooten, Merrily.&quot; (I&#x2019;m not even sure what it meant, but it was perfect.)</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.w">And Jax was fearless. I saw him dive madly at ungettable balls and later fly into a rage at his older brother or the class bully, scary for the fury of his attack, his willingness to sustain a hail of blows if only to land one. Once he launched himself onto the hood of a moving car, trying to reach the driver, a boyfriend of his sister&#x2019;s. I saw him take flight many times from the wooden, paint-peeled railing at the pier, plunging into the warm water of the Sound, his wiry body in catlike adjustment to the force of push-off, the midair moment of peace, then always that little spasm of joy as he crashed through the water&#x2019;s surface.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.x">Now here he was, Jax, the once mighty berserker, laid low. In legends, he would have been the knight felled by the act no one dared to make, the wading of some rough river, the arrow slung at the giant, the throwing of his body at Doom, sacrificing his life for something perhaps meaningless. But here, in suburbia, he&#x2019;d marked the days of our boredom by stunts and diversions, driving, say, with only his knees, to his girlfriend&#x2019;s, over four miles of twisty road. Or jumping from a moving boat. Or laughing that laugh that was on you and with you.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.y">Everything in life held a joke, except this, right now. He rolled his eyes, trying to focus, smacked his cracked lips, unable to produce saliva for all the painkillers mainlined through the IVs needled in his arms. His tongue was swollen. He looked frightened, diminished. &quot;I&#x2019;m sorry,&quot; he said with difficulty, then fell back to his morphine pillow.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.z">That was it. But he&#x2019;d needed to say it and wanted me to convey it to our friends&#x2014;and beyond. Whatever had occurred on that night before Thanksgiving&#x2014;and he had little to no memory of the accident&#x2014;he took full responsibility for it. His eyelids fluttered shut while I stood awkwardly, watching him sink beneath the surface as if bearing witness to a drowning. Then I was shown out.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.10"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong>It happens sometimes</strong> with the dead. A magnetic field builds around their absence, compelling silence&#x2014;or, worse, repelling memory, driving it underground. Until, later, it rises again. And it always does: A drive past the spot in the road, or the cemetery, or the house where Seger lived&#x2014;then didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;and the recollection of a life, and the accident that claimed it, comes back in bony fingers.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.12">So how do you pry yourself loose of the past? We were teenagers then. We knew everything&#x2014;and nothing. As the story got stranger, some of us acted out in unaccountable ways. There were those who disavowed the accident entirely, while others, like me, stupidly went looking for a second accident, to re-enact&#x2014;or atone for&#x2014;the first.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.13">In the days and months after Jax hit the tree, we regularly visited him in his hospital room, where uneaten meals came and went on wheels, where he floated on the fine chemicals that inhibited his pain. When their powers dimmed, you could almost feel him sinking, wincing, fighting. He couldn&#x2019;t move, couldn&#x2019;t get up to pee on his own. Already thin, he quickly lost about twenty-five pounds. He had skin grafts, gnarled, scarred, screaming-red attachments on his feet and his legs, both of which were badly broken. And yet over time, as he regained his senses one by one, he tried to create a whole life up there: nurses who laughed at his jokes, a parade of friends that revolved through. His mother and girlfriend were a ubiquitous presence, as were the wobbly Day-Glo blocks of uneaten Jell-O perched on the nearby lunch tray.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.14">Once, several weeks after the accident, I drove by the body shop to report back on the condition of his beloved sports car, the one that he&#x2019;d paid for with money earned from odd jobs, as if recording the severity of a crash he knew nothing about. But he pointed to a deck of glossy photos already taken by his brother. Fanning them in my hands, I found shot after shot of the ruined car. &quot;It&#x2019;s still a miracle you lived,&quot; I told him, instantly realizing the larger clich&#xE9; that everything you might say in such a situation sounded clich&#xE9;d, which is when I shut up about all that.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.15">Of course, Jax saw no miracle in his survival. Seger was dead, and he hadn&#x2019;t even been able to attend the funeral, the church pews loaded with friends who came as their own act of penance. (&quot;The cemetery is my first stop when I get out of here,&quot; Jax kept repeating.) And there was no miracle because, he knew, someone would be made to pay.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.16">Jax was a brutal realist. Hung like a tattered kite in the antibacterial blankness of his hospital room, held up by wires and sinkered lines, he awaited his fate. His body already broken, the blow would hurt less than Seger&#x2019;s death. But still, it was a desperate way to think. He&#x2019;d been reduced to an immobile fugitive whose faith rested on the fact that he would likely be charged for his friend&#x2019;s death.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.17"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.18"><strong>One other thing</strong> about the dead: With them, so, too, goes God sometimes. This is normal, I suppose, in the aftermath of tragedy: to question one&#x2019;s faith. But no matter how grim the circumstances, Jax never seemed to have done the same, for he was one of my few friends who didn&#x2019;t go&#x2014;by choice or force&#x2014;to church every Sunday. There&#x2019;d been a summer night between our sophomore and junior years when we sat out on the pier, just the two of us, Jax reeling in bluefish. After he filled a bucket with them and a school of thrashing bunkers moved on (they beat the water into a desperate froth above the blues that gave chase), we sat staring at the stars draped over everything and got into an argument about God. I said He existed; Jax said no way. We ended up in his bedroom, paging through his <em>World Book</em> encyclopedia as I tried to press my case with &quot;facts.&quot; The more I jumped from one entry to another&#x2014;Noah&#x2019;s Ark, the Ten Commandments, miracles&#x2014;the more absurd my &quot;scientific inquiry&quot; sounded.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.19">&quot;It&#x2019;s all made-up,&quot; Jax said, laughing more at my stubbornness. &quot;You&#x2019;re never going to find proof of Him in there.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1a">At Seger&#x2019;s funeral, they played another of Seger&#x2019;s favorite songs, with its lyric <em>Childhood living is easy to do.</em> People stood and said the right things. People&#x2014;Seger&#x2019;s girlfriend and parents, family and friends&#x2014;became distraught.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1b">I wanted to show some emotion, too&#x2014;because he would be badly missed&#x2014;but there I sat, boiling at God/no God while otherwise disembodied, bringing the dispassionate intensity of my EMT training to every detail so I could report it back to Jax. As if we were all part of one body that could be fid somehow, as if we could tick off the checklist&#x2014;airway, breathing, circulation&#x2014;to find the hidden ailment stuck in the left ventricle, and be saved.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><strong>Soon the enforced</strong> patterns of our quasi-martial school life reasserted themselves: We dutifully went to our classes, to physics (where the teacher prattled on about the inadequacies of highway entrance ramps, chalking on the board in a swirl of scribbles all the horrible ways you could die while entering the faster flow of traffic) and English (we were reading <em>Gatsby</em> now, the green light, the deadly car accident, the body in the pool) and calculus (as if to solve a proof might put the universe back together, reveal a different god). The swim season had begun, hours lost in bubbles, lap after lap staring at the black lane line of my own failing. And of course I continued riding the ambulance, showing up at random accident scenes to splint the broken femur or bandage the bloody hand.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1e">There was a night when we were called to help a man hit by a car. He&#x2019;d been thrown to the side of a busy main street, bloody and covered in slushy dirt. He was drunk and belligerent, and as the cars came and went and the strobes lit his face, it slowly dawned on me that he was my old swimming coach, Mr. Wharton, a guy I really revered. When I told him who I was and reminded him that he&#x2019;d coached me over hundreds of hours in the pool, he tried with difficulty to look me in the eye. How many times had he pumped me up, or screamed at me in the pool to quit slacking, or celebrated a come-from-behind win, all to show he cared? But on the shoulder of the road now, unable to focus on my face let alone stand in place, he said, &quot;Why don&#x2019; ya go f-f-fuck yourself!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1f">Much more polite was the concussed kid at the ice rink who gently barfed on me when I bent over him, covering me with bilious warmth. &quot;I&#x2019;m sorry,&quot; the boy mumbled.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><strong>From his first</strong> return to consciousness, Jax had no memory of the accident, none whatsoever, but accepted his guilt as a reflex. Of course, we, his friends, didn&#x2019;t care about blood-alcohol levels and toxicology tests. He&#x2019;d made a bad mistake, was filled with contrition, and had our instant forgiveness.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1i">But Jax&#x2019;s lack of memory didn&#x2019;t stop the police in their investigation; it drove them deeper. What exactly had happened that night became a nagging mystery. Pils of rumor and eyewitness account began to resolve into startling coherence.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1j">For instance, I had friends who, at the time of the accident, had just finished playing paddle tennis at the country club up the road. They&#x2019;d heard the loud crash, and when they came out of the parking lot, they were startled by a car moving past them. Later, when piecing it back together, they kept wondering: Why was Flynn&#x2019;s car driving away?</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1k">But all these things soon became clear to Jax when the police paid him that awaited visit one day in his hospital room, offering a surprising theory that went like this: On that dark stretch of twisty road, as Jax zoomed north, Flynn&#x2019;s car went to pass, bumping the rear left panel of Jax&#x2019;s car, which sent him careening off a telephone pole, into the protracted skid that listed left to right and hurtled his car into the tree.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1l">Could it have been true?</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1m">When confronted with the theory, Jax was incredulous. According to the police transcript from the taped interview, he said, &quot;I don&#x2019;t think any of my friends would do that.... First of all, [Flynn] and I are damn good friends.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1n">(Beneath the fusillade of his verbal assaults, one of Jax&#x2019;s greatest redeeming traits was that he saw those in his inner circle as figures of unimpeachable character, as loyal as he. For all the sport he made of us&#x2014;and we of him&#x2014;he was absolutely blind to the deeper stamp of one&#x2019;s defect. His belief in his friends was so complete it verged on na&#xEF;vet&#xE9;.)</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1o">Sometime around Christmas, however, Flynn&#x2019;s car was impounded, and the police would later say that paint found on its front fender seemed to match the color of Jax&#x2019;s car. By spring, Flynn had been charged with negligent homicide, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, and evading responsibility. The narrative that had Jax in a moment of singular teenage elation and irresponsibility now opened to another possibility: two cars traveling at a high rate of speed when one car passed on a tight turn and drove the other off the road. Or this: Flynn&#x2019;s car passing without warning. That is, as much as Jax had screwed up, maybe it hadn&#x2019;t been all his fault in the end.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1p"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1q"><strong>So much</strong> of what happened in my town&#x2014;the ancient town I knew and loved, the sprinkler-fed garden that existed during the Reagan Pleistocene in one of the outer rings around Manhattan&#x2014;was never spoken of, or if so, only in whispered gossip. Affairs, eating disorders, teenage pregnancy, trips to rehab: Everybody seemed to know everybody&#x2019;s business, but it was cloaked and closeted. No matter how egregious or boorish the behavior or betrayal, to say it out loud, to reveal it beyond the social circle for which it was meant, was an affront almost as egregious. Every scarlet letter was partially hidden.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1r">This is true of many places, or perhaps true of <em>every</em> place. No small shame accompanies the moment when our failings are made public&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s with tense, bated breath that most wait for the unpleasantness to go away. However unsettling the news, a year or two or three and it can be relegated to the snowdrift of memory and then forgotten, replaced by the new drama of the day.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1s">As a child, I found this disorienting. The parents were whispering about <em>something,</em> something with intimations of pain or dread, dark fairy tales of some sort, but <em>what?</em></p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1t">The charges against Flynn made the story uncomfortably public, and soon the paper ran a long article detailing the events of that night before Thanksgiving; the strained, surreal situation at our high school of friends trying to pick sides, or figure out what to believe in the first place; and the tragedy of alcohol-related car accidents in our town. Was it suburban privilege, or our access to cars, or the dark, winding roads? The police captain was quoted as saying that over the course of the past three years, a dozen young residents had died in automobile crashes. The pastor said he&#x2019;d never seen such &quot;tragedy with youth.&quot; The leader of a youth religious group claimed, &quot;There&#x2019;s nothing but victims.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1u"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1v"><strong>One night</strong> during our monthly organizational meeting at the ambulance service, in a room packed with fifty kids&#x2014;everything coming to a standstill at twenty-minute intervals as another commuter train roared by&#x2014;I found myself launching a prayer, the first, really, since the night of the accident. This particular evening included the awarding of special gold stars, reserved for the members of a particular crew for an exceptional call, our version of the Medal of Honor. This crew, as I remember it, had responded to a very bad crash on the interstate, had performed CPR under harrowing circumstances, and had brought someone back to life.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1w">To be so recognized was the pinnacle, to have your name called to come down and receive a star from the ambulance service&#x2019;s founder, to be so distinguished for heroics among your own hypercompetent, wildly applauding peers. (We all knew they&#x2019;d seen and done something we both hoped to and hoped <em>not</em> to.) It meant that for at least that moment the prophecy was true: You were so good, in fact, that you <em>could</em> raise the dead.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1x"><em>Dear God,</em> I found myself praying, <em>give me something horrible and bloody. Let my next call be a multiple-car crash with gasoline glugging all over the highway, or a cardiac arrest in a house fire, or a kid electrocuted on the railroad tracks. Let it be a shark attack or an alien invasion, whatever makes the best movie. Whatever is the most impossibly fucked-up, Lord. Just let me lay my hands on some big, honking, metal-twisted tragedy, so I can work my own miracle this time.</em></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1y"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.1z"><strong>Jax came out of the hospital</strong> with snow on the ground, then convalesced at home for a while. When the police asked to talk to him, he went without his lawyers, against their advice, and tried to answer what he could about the accident. Eventually he returned to school on crutches, which later gave way to this clunky stimulating device he&#x2019;d sometimes wrap around his leg and plug into the wall, what we called his &quot;bone machine.&quot; He hobbled the same halls as Flynn, but they studiously avoided each other now while the various lawyers prepared for the criminal trial. Meanwhile, it seemed clear that Seger&#x2019;s family would bring a civil suit of some sort, perhaps against all the boys. But at least on the surface, everything carried on, despite the awkwardness. College applications were completed and sent out; no one got dumped by his girlfriend.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.20">Time accelerated. The snow melted, the season changed, and our town bloomed: daffodils and forsythia at Easter, the dogwoods and cherry trees not long after. Lawns turned green again, the leaves drawing lush curtains over everything. The pier was repainted; boats were put back in the Sound, their sails snapping in the wind.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.21">With the passage of time, Jax doubled his efforts to retrieve some shard of absent memory. The most important night of his life to that point and he couldn&#x2019;t remember anything but leaving Seger&#x2019;s house to go to a party. It was some cruel, cosmic joke. His antipathies, guided inward by guilt, now had an outward target. When Flynn pleaded not guilty to the charges, reiterating through his lawyers that he hadn&#x2019;t been at the accident scene that night&#x2014;a version of events backed by Xavier&#x2014;Jax became animated again. As they maintained their innocence, Jax&#x2019;s fury grew.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.22">It was simple: Knowing what Jax believed they knew, how could they have left him there? And where had they gone?</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.23">It was hard for him to concentrate on anything but the accident&#x2014;it all went back to that stretch of road. We drove it every night, in our minds. And Jax tortured himself with trying to remember. Eventually, in conversation with his doctors, it was agreed that he would visit a Yale psychiatrist who used hypnotism. It was maybe something Jax would have once regarded skeptically, but what other choice did he have?</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.24">The session lasted nearly two hours. He left the psychiatrist&#x2019;s office not knowing anything, hypnotized as he was&#x2014;nor did his parents. The psychiatrist promised that after reviewing the videotape, he&#x2019;d send it along. Jax could only confirm what the psychiatrist had said, that things had gone &quot;very well,&quot; whatever that meant.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.25">A few weeks later the videotape arrived. Jax called, I drove down to his house, and we joined his parents to watch it for the first time. When Jax appeared on the television screen&#x2014;or what I remember of Jax on that screen&#x2014;he sat straight up, wearing a button-down shirt. His eyes were shut, and he seemed fairly relad, answering some basic opening questions. He was apparently already hypnotized, and the psychiatrist pointed out a needle stuck halfway into the flesh between his thumb and pointer finger, though Jax said he felt no pain and seemed to have no knowledge of the pin.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.26">The psychiatrist then asked Jax to navigate the first four-fifths of the night in question. Jax described how Seger had loaded in with Jax at Seger&#x2019;s house, riding shotgun, how Flynn and Xavier followed in the other car. Jax led them up Ocean to Main, Main to Birch, Birch to the high school. Then the two cars emptied through the high school parking lot, turned left onto Coral, and took a right onto High. At this point, they were a quarter mile from the tree.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.27"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.28"><strong>In the videotape,</strong> Jax, whose eyes are closed but tracking beneath the lids, seems at ease charting their progress. The psychiatrist leads him slowly, asks him to regard the action as though it&#x2019;s &quot;a photograph.&quot; Jax is talking to Seger, music on the radio, streetlights passing in longer intervals now, the speedometer needling: twenty, twenty-five, thirty... Then he&#x2019;s on the straightaway before the curve with the maple tree, and the psychiatrist says, &quot;Concentrate on your rearview mirror.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.29">There are leaves skittering, dark branches overhead, a wedge of light before the sports car. He reaches to turn up the music, presses the gas. The lights are reflecting in the rearview mirror, the other car right on his tail. He is talking to Seger.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2a">He&#x2019;s talking to Seger. The music is blaring. Leaves are skittering. The road takes a turn. Music, leaves, dark branches. Seconds from hitting the tree, he looks in the rearview mirror, answers the psychiatrist. &quot;I see [Flynn&#x2019;s] car,&quot; he says, &quot;see him cut out left. He&#x2019;s getting closer. What&#x2019;s he doing?&quot; For the first time, he seems to be talking not to the psychiatrist but to himself. &quot;He&#x2019;s almost parallel,&quot; he says. &quot;There&#x2019;s no way.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2b">His eyes shut tight. He looks stricken, thin lips pressed together. And then his body rocks once, very hard.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2d"><strong>Did it happen like this?</strong> [**] If you&#x2019;d seen the tape, you might have thought so. At the very least, it gave Jax a narrative to which he could finally cling as the courts began to parse the evidence of what had occurred that night.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2e">First came the criminal charges against Flynn that hovered over him for a year, ending in a courtroom drama that found Jax hobbling in on crutches and Flynn home from college accompanied to court by a dozen family members. Despite several eyewitnesses placing Flynn&#x2019;s car near the scene after a loud crash, the prosecutor admitted that it was &quot;a difficult case to evaluate&quot; and decided not to prosecute. He said his decision was based on the lack of reliability of Jax&#x2019;s account under hypnosis, (especially since the theory that Flynn&#x2019;s car bumped his had initially been advanced by police), and the judge dismissed the case. Outside the courtroom, Flynn&#x2019;s lawyer said the ruling &quot;completely vindicates my client&quot; and that Flynn was headed immediately back to college.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2f">In the wake of that dismissal came an array of civil suits that dragged along for years, yet after Jax&#x2019;s and Flynn&#x2019;s lawyers settled with Seger&#x2019;s family (for $100,000 and $300,000, respectively), everything whittled down to one: Jax suing Flynn for damages.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2g">Nearly four years later, the newspapers covered that trial blow by blow. On the stand, Flynn testified that they&#x2019;d been drinking 7-Up and vodka at Seger&#x2019;s house, detailing the route of his travels, which was nearly the same as Jax&#x2019;s, claiming he&#x2019;d never seen an accident and only learned about it twenty minutes later, after arriving at the party. Under cross-examination, when questioned about the possibly matching color of paint found on the fender of his car, he said, &quot;I never hit his car before, nor any other...car.&quot; The paint smear, the director of the state&#x2019;s forensics laboratory testified, was &quot;similar, but possibly not the same.&quot; There wasn&#x2019;t enough paint to allow a more complete analysis. Other details emerged: They&#x2019;d begun drinking around 6 P.M. and left for the party around 9:30. At an intersection well before the site of the accident, Xavier had jumped out of Flynn&#x2019;s car and run ahead to Jax&#x2019;s for matches, after which they traveled several lengths behind Jax before pulling away along a road leading to the party. Another eyewitness reportedly emerged, who testified that she had seen only Jax&#x2019;s speeding car near the scene moments before hearing the crash. In the end the jury found Flynn &quot;negligent, but not responsible&quot; and awarded no damages.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2h">It was senior year, 17 years old, the soccer and football season just over, a party in the offing. Could life have been any better?</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2i"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2j"><strong>At the end</strong> of the school year, just before prom, my prayer was answered: On a humid, cloudy night, I got my call. Already I&#x2019;d racked up my cardiac arrest (that neighbor of ours) and a chaotic highway accident (an unsatisfactory broken femur), but this sounded promisingly bad.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2k">We were summoned to a vast seawater farm, with its rocky hillocks and ancient oaks, a place we knew for its Revolutionary War battles and midnight cow-toppling. This night, however, the darkness was almost a substance, and even as we directed our spotlight up into the trees, the rays were absorbed, leaving nothing to see. Eventually we came upon a car on the shoulder with its hazards blinking, someone who had witnessed the accident and rushed to help. The ambulance stopped, and I jumped out.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2l">The way I&#x2019;d dreamed it always involved saving someone. I would perform some suitable miracle, and later, in the most ridiculous part of the fantasy, my victim and I would become friends, exchange gifts, and if she was pretty, maybe get married, her wheelchair being proof that I&#x2019;d snatched her from sure death. Now I ran over soggy ground to the car. I shone a flashlight over boulders and downed branches. The car was off in the trees, sitting a couple of feet back from the gnarled trunk of an oak, the hood accordioned to half its normal size. The driver&#x2019;s door was ajar, and a dark figure loomed in back, the Good Samaritan trying to pull and hold traction from his awkward angle.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2m">Despite his best efforts, the woman&#x2019;s head still lay facedown on the steering wheel. I could smell gasoline and manure&#x2014;and gin and beer. I, too, was in an awkward spot, down on one knee inside the open front door. I positioned the flashlight on the dash, and then, as I placed my hands over each side of her head, over her ears, with both my pinkies lifting from below her jaw, her face rose before me. Her skin was soft to touch, but she was badly bloodied, and her nose, where there had been one, was now just a piece of bone. There was a clean hole in her forehead, and something green and gooey seeped out. Her eyes, half shut, were white. She was groaning softly, rhythmically, the kind of groan that reflected a pain so deep it may not have been felt consciously.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2n">I regretted my decision the minute I made it. And now we were stuck together.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2o">It was going to be a long time before we could move her&#x2014;we were going to need the Jaws of Life to get her out&#x2014;let alone before she would see an emergency room. The girl or woman, maybe in her mid-twenties, had hit the tree going very fast, fast enough for her skull to have been punctured and brain matter to have seeped out.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2p">I can recall a lot about the minutiae of that night, about how the firefighters arrived, lighting huge spots on the car, making it seem like day in that glade, and then the whining of the saw as they cut her out. Another ambulance arrived, with grown-up paramedics authorized to administer drugs, which they did, running lines from drip bags to the veins in her arms. There must have been two dozen people working, spectating, helping, at the height of the action. And then, after they cut her loose, I remember standing on the back runner of the grown-up ambulance, standing there as they sheared the clothes from her body&#x2014;her skin was pale, her breasts full&#x2014;and put in more lines and an oxygen mask over her face, trying to stabilize her before leaving for the hospital.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2q">Afterward, when the grown-up ambulance went screaming off, everyone took their things and quickly retreated. We were pretty shook up; someone on our crew was crying. The woman was in a deep vegetative state, on her way to death by morning. And we&#x2019;d done nothing to change that. I myself came closest to a feeling when the clouds parted and the moonlight came down over everything, including the serrated wreckage, in thick, pale, silver beams, a moment that could have been godly but was nothing of the sort. The feeling was of betrayal and shock.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2r">Now whenever my mind slips to such naive meditations&#x2014;these mock-heroic dreams of saving anyone from anything&#x2014;I need only conjure that girl&#x2019;s face in my hands again. I need only hold that unmendable body close to realize how far I&#x2019;d traveled from Thanksgiving. I got what I&#x2019;d wished for, and I wanted to give it all back.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2s"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2t"><strong>One last memory</strong> of that night: When I came home in my ambulance whites and orange fluorescent jacket, splatters of blood on my sneakers, my father was sitting at the kitchen table, his work arrayed before him in scribbles on the yellow legal pads he favored. I gave him a few details, leaving out the part about when the girl&#x2019;s parents showed up at the scene.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2u">&quot;It sounds pretty bad,&quot; he said.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2v">&quot;Yeah, it was,&quot; I said.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2w">There was a pause, a long one. I couldn&#x2019;t look him in the eyes for fear it would all come out, all at once, in a great overwhelming gush, everything I&#x2019;d held down. He might have already understood this. But I&#x2019;d spent the year arming and armoring myself, and no one dared to approach anymore.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2x">My father sat at the table, his face registering a father&#x2019;s concern. If he had something he needed to say&#x2014;or a question to ask&#x2014;he thought better of it. Or I cut him off, on my own at last. &quot;Good night,&quot; I said, putting my foot on the first step of the back stairway leading to my room, unmoving for a moment, then shifting my weight heavily to climb.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2y">&quot;Good night, son,&quot; said my father.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.2z"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.30"><strong>This past Thanksgiving</strong> marked the thirty-third anniversary of Jax&#x2019;s car accident and of Seger&#x2019;s death. For a long time after-ward, you could see scars of the wreck on the trunk of the maple tree they hit, written in what seemed like Sanskrit. It was hard to look at; but for the few marks, the tree itself seemed to flourish, carrying no memory of that night.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.31">Over time, the enormous trunk healed itself, its bark without blemish, and then one day it was simply chainsawed to widen the sidewalk. In all those years that the tree had loomed there&#x2014;blooming its gaudy leaves in the spring, losing them like discarded twenties in the fall&#x2014;I&#x2019;d pass by searching for evidence that the accident had actually happened, that it hadn&#x2019;t just been a dream. My attitude was coldly forensic. I often thought to stop and touch the markings like an archaeologist, though never did. When the tree suddenly vanished&#x2014;only pale sawdust littered the spot&#x2014;there came this rush of feeling: sorrow, elation, guilt.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.32">In the years after, Jax built a hectic, successful career in finance. Sometimes, when visiting home, I might drop in to find him hungover on a Sunday, on the couch beneath a blanket, watching old horror films. Eventually, some time after the rest of us, he married and had children. A few years back, when I told him I wanted to write something about the accident, he said, &quot;Write the truth, then.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.33">It took a long while, because as I found, the magnetic field around the dead really does repel memory at first. But once I let it all back in, I couldn&#x2019;t shake Seger, the one who couldn&#x2019;t speak at all, the one who was suddenly everywhere. One newspaper article from the time of the civil trial detailed the courtroom testimony of a financial expert who was asked to assess the amount of money Seger might have generated in his life. The expert said $1.3 million was a fair guess, which would amount to about $2.8 million today, but it seemed all the more tragic to reduce his life to a number like that. Give us any other number: YouTube videos sent or dogs owned, favors for neighbors or baby pictures e-mailed. Before the rock closed over the vault, I wish someone had speculated about what he&#x2019;d found that night &#x2014;God or no God&#x2014;when he passed through the tree.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.34">Perhaps we really are surrounded by the past, made prisoners of it. No matter how far we travel, how hard we try to forget, the scarred tree forever stands by the side of the road, if only in our minds. The only way to drive by is to set the past straight, once and for all, by remembering.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.35">Talking to my brother, a lawyer now with kids of his own, I ask what he recalls about that night, and he says two things: <em>(1)</em> that the EMT from our ambulance service had told him something he couldn&#x2019;t ever forget, that Seger had been found with a shard of glass in his eye; and <em>(2)</em> that I had originally planned to join Jax and the rest of them on that evening, prior to the party.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.36">And maybe if I had, I would have missed the opportunity to write this down, as I have, which is the only way I can make sense of anything or realize ultimately that there&#x2019;s no sense to be made of it: that once upon a time in a faraway town, we grew up&#x2014;and some of us lived. And some of us tried to turn away but never quite could.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.37">But most of all, if I&#x2019;d been there that night, I couldn&#x2019;t tell you now that Jax, my old friend, can still be a beautiful pain in the ass and the truest person I&#x2019;ll know. If I were never to see him again, this would be my memory of him, of that year: the bucket full of blues, the encyclopedia without God, the energy of his wiry body flying, bowed in the sun, trying to remember why he ever wanted to leave this earth in the first place.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.38">[*] Names have been changed throughout.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.39">[**] This section has been updated to reflect additional information regarding the criminal charges and civil litigation related to the accident.</p><p data-reactid=".7zn8k631fk.1.1.0.0.4.3a"><a href="../contributors/michael-paterniti"><strong>MICHAEL PATERNITI</strong></a> <em>is a</em> <strong>GQ</strong> <em>correspondent.
