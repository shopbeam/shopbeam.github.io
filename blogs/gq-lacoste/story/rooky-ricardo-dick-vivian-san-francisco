  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI first find myself in Rooky Ricardo\u0027s Records because I\u0027m trying to outrun The Dread. It hunted me, snarling and snapping, all the way here: across the San Francisco Bay, through downtown, up a couple of viciously steep hills that level off into the city\u0027s Lower Haight neighborhood. I\u0027m breathless and drenched in sweat. I\u0027ve been running all day. For months. Years, even.\u000A\u000AThe Dread takes many savage forms—a Netflix home screen, a Spotify search bar, the iTunes store—but it always yields the same effect. It is the paralysis of infinite possibility, the moment of having everything and nothing all at once. It is the feeling of being an ape in space, gazing glassy-eyed into digital infinity. Today, in 2013, we are faced with almost incomprehensible access—to music, movies and so much more—and yet we are ironically stuck. I am here today because I\u0027ve heard about Dick Vivian, a man who helps us get unstuck.\u000A\u000ADick\u0027s records are everything The Dread is not—persnickety, fragile, imperfect, evanescent. They cannot be scrolled through effortlessly. They cannot be accumulated through massive, instantaneous transactions. They must be hoisted, stored, categorized, dusted, flipped and coddled. They must be fretted over. Most importantly, they must be purchased from Rooky\u0027s—an actual place that contains actual people with whom you must converse in all sorts of imperfect, unguarded ways.\u000A\u000AThis is the story of one such person—his breathtaking kindness, his passion, his sadness, the things he hides. It is a story about The Dread and a man who spent a lifetime resisting it.\u000A\u000AThis is a story about the closest thing we have to an antidote.\u000A\u000A SIDE A Dick Vivian is very much in love, and he will do his best to make sure that you fall in love, too. At 65, he appears built for the task: Cupid belly, a powdered sugar dusting of beard on round cheeks, brown eyes always on the verge of a knowing wink. He knows the right buttons to push, too—when to tease you about the length of your shorts, when to call you \u0022honey bunny.\u0022 He will greet you with the sort of doting, half-concerned \u0022helloooo!\u0022 a mother gives her son who has lost a little weight. He will remember how many slices of lemon you take in your iced tea. He will joke about wanting to marry you. He will offer you candy, which you will most likely accept.\u000A\u000ADick will do all of this because he wants you to experience love the way he does—unflinchingly, fiercely, naively. He first fell in love at the age of ten, while lying alone on his bed, and he has dedicated half of his life to recreating the feeling again and again. In Dick\u0027s view, we are all just a few crucial seconds away from tumbling head over heels.\u000A\u000A\u0022I view myself as a service,\u0022 he says. \u0022I don\u0027t love everyone that walks in the door. But I want to make it work for them. I will help people find what they\u0027re looking for if I have it.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat Dick loves most are records—45s, specifically—and he loves them with a teen girl\u0027s fanatical ardor. In his home, he has more than 75,000, all categorized in a baroque, Cusackian way that only he understands. In Rooky Ricardo\u0027s, which he owns, he has about 40,000 more. The place is a 60s-era kitsch capsule: Chubby Checkers posters, toy bumper cars, two different rotary phones (one teal, one pink). The 45s themselves line walls, crowd shelves and sit in tidy stacks on the floor. So dire is this surplus that Dick\u0027s taken to nailing records with inadvertently prurient titles to the store\u0027s bathroom wall. They include, but are not limited to: \u0022Still No. 2\u0022 by Ben Colder (MGM); \u0022I Go For You,\u0022 Sammy Davis Jr. and Carmen McRae (Decca); and \u0022Got a Match?,\u0022 Frank Gallup (Classic Records).\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s here at Rooky\u0027s, days away from the store\u0027s 26th anniversary, that Dick runs through the highlights and principles of a 55-year-old vinyl obsession. Sitting across from me at a repurposed diner table, he talks about his life-changing first listen of the Del-Vikings\u0027 \u0022Whispering Bells\u0022 (\u0022I thought I had died and gone to heaven.\u0022), why he doesn\u0027t carry anything by The Beatles (\u0022Do you know what a foodie is? Well there are record versions of that, and they want to ask me about a Beatles album so they can tell me about it.\u0022), and why he never got into LPs (\u0022What you lose is the warmth.\u0022). Dick doesn\u0027t know anything about rock or punk or jazz or classical, and he doesn\u0027t care to know. What he does know is soul and oldies, and especially girl groups from the 1960s—acts like The Marvelettes, The Chirelles, Dolly and the Fashions and Maureen Gray. It is within this time period, with its bouffants and heartaches and brittle, delicately suggestive harmonies, that Dick prefers to linger. You are welcome to join him.\u000A\u000AOn the store\u0027s cash machine, there\u0027s a mock-vintage magnet with a well-preened man\u0027s head floating above the slogan \u0022Everybody loves Dick!\u0022 This is not an exaggeration. When he turned 50, 300 people came to his birthday party. He estimates that he has about 50 \u0022very close friends.\u0022 As customers file into the store, it\u0027s very hard to discern who are bosom buddies and whom he is just now meeting for the first time. Jokes are cracked. Hugs are administered. The customer demographics fluctuate in the sort of turbulent, irresponsible way only San Francisco demographics can fluctuate: the mid-40s greaser/techie with arm tattoos and bright blue sneakers. The 25-year-old Sudanese PhD student. The brooding, unshaven collectors. The Swedish. Dick greets them all with that springy, buoyant \u0022helloooo!\u0022 that sounds like it\u0027s been fired from a cartoon slingshot. He then sets about helping them, which typically is some combination of teasing and flirting.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADick: How are you today? You got a list for me?\u000A\u000A Customer: You don\u0027t remember me, huh?\u000A\u000A Dick (purring): I do remember you. Of course I do.\u000A\u000A Customer: You sure?\u000A\u000A Dick: I\u0027m positive. Sacramento.\u000A\u000A Customer: Wow. You are good.\u000A\u000A Dick: Remember we almost got married?\u000A\u000A Customer: Yeah, we did. Why didn\u0027t that happen?\u000A\u000A Dick: Well, you gained a little weight, and so did I.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s common for customers to come in with handwritten wish lists. Dick will either direct them to a specific section or suggest something similar. \u0022 ‘Friday Night\u0027 is probably in here,\u0022 he says to this guy. \u0022I don\u0027t know Donny Burdick.\u0022 Turning to me, he says, \u0022Probably half of what came out on 45s has never been documented. It\u0027s unobtainable. That\u0027s why my store is one of the many record stores that does well. It\u0027s because people can come in and make their own discoveries. Sometimes I guide them along, sometimes I can\u0027t help them.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s here that I ask my first stupid question—the one that betrays my status as a Pandora-surfing, turntable-less 26-year-old technobrat. \u0022Do you order stuff for people?\u0022\u000A\u000ADick looks quizzical. \u0022You can\u0027t order stuff. You have to find it, or it has to show up.\u0022\u000A\u000AFor someone whose tastes and knowledge are as specific as Dick\u0027s, it\u0027s a very good time to be in the vinyl business. Sales of the medium have been climbing steadily for the past five years, and last April, 244,000 records were sold in one week—the largest amount since Nielsen SoundScan started keeping track in 1991. In 2012, citizens of these United States purchased 4.6 million vinyl records—an 18 percent increase from 2011. And this year, we\u0027re on pace for an even larger bump. Though digital music purchases still outpace records by a rate of about 50 to 1, the surge has been enough to help specialists like Dick carve out a niche for themselves.\u000A\u000AAnd carve he has. By 1960s terms—the terms on which Dick operates in most facets of life—Rooky Ricardo\u0027s is doing moderately well. But by 2013 terms, its performance is extraordinary. Dick doesn\u0027t like talking exact numbers (nor was he really keeping records before 2008), but suffice it to say that his business is growing steadily. On any given weekday, he can make more than what he made in a month ten years ago—sometimes ten times as much. And last March, his biggest month ever, he pulled in close to $18,000.\u000A\u000A\u0022There was a period there where everybody got rid of their records and took that money and bought CDs,\u0022 he says. \u0022They recreated their collection on CD. Now those same people are coming back, regretting that, and wanting to recreate the library that they once had on vinyl.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn some ways, Dick has gotten this far simply by loving the same things he\u0027s always loved—the harmonies, the horn stabs, the gentle innuendoes about candy and \u0022dancing\u0022 all night. Customers come to him because they want soul and oldies, not because they\u0027re looking for Zeppelin rarities or abstruse jazz fusion. They want very specific things from a very specific era. They want to be welcomed and assisted and goaded lovingly. Basically, they want the sort of singularity only true love can afford, and they know Dick can help. \u0022I\u0027m the kind of restaurant that\u0027s got ten items,\u0022 he explains. \u0022That\u0027s what I\u0027m selling. If you like that, you\u0027ll be in heaven. If you don\u0027t, then that\u0027s not for you.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe simple explanation of why Dick is doing better than ever is that his tastes are finally back in vogue. Trends sail on the winds of exclusivity, of being the first and only possessor, and accumulating rare 45s is a natural extension of this. The harder question to answer is why a generation of young people—those with staggering, almost infinite access to free music—are seeking out an experience as constrained and unpredictable as record collecting. With more media at our fingertips than at any time in the history of the world, why do we choose to limit our experience?\u000A\u000AThe answer is simple, says John Vanderslice, the San Francisco-based indie musician and record producer. Just like food, the songs we consume \u0022still have to be portioned out. Like, you have dinner at six. It\u0027s not like you just have this open buffet twenty-four hours a day in your house.\u0022\u000A\u000AVanderslice is a Rooky Ricardo\u0027s regular and in many ways a musical purist. He does not keep a digital mixing console at Tiny Telephone, his studio in San Francisco\u0027s Mission District. He insists that artists record on two-inch reel-to-reel tape, and he aggressively limits the number of instruments available to them. When it comes to vinyl though, he\u0027s more of an omnivore.\u000A\u000A\u0022You have these twelve, fourteen, twenty records that you\u0027re just listening to in a loop—shit, sometimes I just put on the same side over and over and over again,\u0022 he says. \u0022I don\u0027t do that when I\u0027m listening to stuff on my computer, and I listen to shitloads of music. I listen to tons of music on my phone when I\u0027m hiking. It doesn\u0027t give me the same jolt. It doesn\u0027t provide the same experience to me.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis sort of consumption might be considered a sort of postmodern listening paradigm for the modern era—part embrace of digital\u0027s omnipresence, part protest against the The Dread, which encroaches any time you try to settle on just one song from a 120-gig iTunes library. Many of Dick\u0027s customers—the younger ones, especially—are conversant in this mode of consumption. Records, unlike every other available music service—indeed, unlike pretty much everything else that exists and is sold in 2013—are desirable for what they don\u0027t possess.\u000A\u000ABut Dick always knew this. He\u0027s just been waiting patiently for you to figure it out. If you don\u0027t come around, that\u0027s OK with him, too. He\u0027s never been one to judge.\u000A\u000A\u0022My store is now current,\u0022 he says. \u0022It\u0027s one of the most current stores in San Francisco. Each forty-five that you hold is a piece of history, and they sound the way they were meant to sound.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut isn\u0027t that a judgment call?\u000A\u000AStupid question number two. Dick narrows his eyes at me.\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s not a judgment call. That\u0027s the way it is.\u0022\u000A\u000A SIDE B Dick Vivian is not in love with anyone, and he has not been in love for many years. He does not ever say it explicitly, but he fears heartbreak with the sort of ardent, poetic innocence normally reserved for oldies songs. He was an only child that never knew his father. He didn\u0027t see much of his mother, who worked full-time as a secretary. He is gay, and twice heartbroken—first by his two life\u0027s loves, then by the AIDS virus that withered their bodies and ripped them prematurely out of this world. He has never married. These days, he says, the desire to meet somebody \u0022doesn\u0027t even cross my mind.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADick lives alone on one floor of an enormous, impeccably maintained Victorian near the heart of San Francisco\u0027s Castro District. His home, like Rooky\u0027s, is a wistful sanctuary of 1960s-era bric-a-brac. The walls are adorned with classic movie posters and high school yearbook photos, and old films fill the shelves near his DVD player—W.C. Fields collections, Abbott and Costello anthologies, etc. We sit in what he calls the \u0022Red Room,\u0022 a maroon lounge with a flat screen TV, some mod furniture and, of course, a closet packed with 45s. It\u0027s here, in a space free from friends and strangers and any possible combination of the two, that Dick finally opens up about the many things he does not love.\u000A\u000AFirst up is his junior high experience. Maybe because he was not athletic, or because he was short, or because he had a voice like a parrot, Dick struggled to fit in. \u0022I went home crying every day,\u0022 he remembers. In his time alone, he obsessed over top 40 Radio, falling asleep to it at night and poring over its weekly rankings pamphlets. His weekly $1 allowance invariably went toward buying records. With no siblings, the music became a sort of refuge for him, a respite from his own Dread. \u0022Records were always kind of my security,\u0022 he says. \u0022I had friends like anyone else, but that was always my time alone.\u0022\u000A\u000AAround this time, two girls from Dick\u0027s class convinced him to learn a dance called \u0022the Bop\u0022 with them. Something immediately clicked, and Dick set about learning as many dances as he could– the Lindy Hop, the Mashed Potato, the Jitterbug—which he says helped him impress girls and make friends throughout junior high and high school. He kept dancing after graduation, throughout college at San Jose State, and into his early twenties. During lunch breaks at his first job, he would duck into nearby clubs and learn what he could.\u000A\u000ADick met Steve, the first man that he truly loved, at one of these dance clubs. The way Dick describes him, Steve was younger, and very religious, with a beautiful body and caring heart. He would listen to Dick in the same rapt way Dick listened to his 45s. He would show up, unprompted, with gifts. \u0022He was the first one who treated me like I dreamed someone in a relationship should be treated,\u0022 Dick recalls. But this was the 1970s, and Dick still wanted the things he loved about the 1960s to be true. He wanted the story he had been told so many times, in so many iterations, by so many pop songs. Sex was not as important to him as emotional commitment was, \u0022and a lot of the people that I happened to fall in love with were so attractive that it\u0027s just natural that they\u0027re going to be out there.\u0022 Steve strayed, and Dick couldn\u0027t keep on.\u000A\u000ABill was a similar story. They met when Dick was 30, and Dick moved to San Francisco to be with him. The two stayed exclusive for a while, but now it was the 1980s, and the Castro was not the right place for Dick to hold onto a monogamous mate. Steve \u0022was so handsome and there were just so many people that liked him,\u0022 Dick remembers. \u0022I didn\u0027t want to compete.\u0022 After six good months and 12 bad ones, the two broke up.\u000A\u000A\u0022I think that may have caused him to opt out, because that really broke his heart,\u0022 says Nick Waterhouse, an L.A.-based soul musician and one of Dick\u0027s closest friends. \u0022He didn\u0027t move to the Castro to be there. It was just that time. He didn\u0027t overly think it. He sees a lot of those male relationships as terminal.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not that Dick hated the fact that he was gay; it\u0027s that he always felt cheated by the designation and its limitations—especially in a place like the Castro, where flamboyancy often went hand in hand with social credibility. \u0022He philosophically does not see himself as ‘gay,\u0027 \u0022 Waterhouse continues. \u0022He feels strongly that he\u0027s an individual.\u0022 Back in the 80s, he would leave parties because everybody was calling each other \u0022Mary.\u0022 \u0022He was like, ‘There were so many goddamn Marys in the room, I didn\u0027t know what to do with myself.\u0027\u0022\u000A\u000AAround this time, Dick was working as a waiter at a popular gay restaurant called Alta Plaza in San Francisco\u0027s Presidio neighborhood. The AIDS epidemic was charging through the city, and as the years passed, he began to witness a heartbreaking progression: Couples would come in, fall in love, fall ill. Months would pass, then just one half of the couple would start showing up, sometimes with the other\u0027s family.\u000A\u000AOne evening in the early nineties, Steve came in to say his goodbyes. Dick was knocked off guard. He had not seen his former partner sick. \u0022I just hugged him,\u0022 Dick recalls. \u0022Then I had to—story of my life—go right back in.\u0022 As he returned to one of his tables, a woman looked up from her menu and brayed, \u0022I\u0027ll have the chicken!\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s at this point in the story that Dick looks exhausted for the first time since we met. All the cheeriness he emits at the store—all the social sophistication and instincts that half a century of waiting on customers affords him—seems to drain away momentarily. It\u0027s not that he looks uncommonly ancient; it\u0027s that he finally looks exactly as old as he is.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m sure a lot of those feelings kind of barricade me up,\u0022 he says. \u0022I wouldn\u0027t say I\u0027m shut down, because I still love my life. There are so many people in my world that are fresh and vibrant and alive. That\u0027s what I feed off of. Not as a couple. Just as another person to make my life interesting.\u0022\u000A\u000ADick\u0027s Dread is different from ours, but it stalks around the periphery of similar things: a fear of insignificance, of being marooned, of exiting life without having truly held onto something. To look around his house—and Rooky\u0027s, for that matter—is to bear witness to his towering, impressive defense against it. He\u0027s cocooned himself in an era he understands and surrounded himself with people he knows won\u0027t hurt him. The heartbreak he does allow himself to still experience comes in a format he\u0027s familiar with: two songs at a time, with a quick break in the middle.\u000A\u000A LINER NOTES I return to Rooky\u0027s on a rainy Sunday, biking up those ruthless hills with a modest but daunting goal: to choose my first record. I still don\u0027t have a turntable, but I plan to buy one soon, so I figure my purchase is about as excusable as a teenager buying a custom spoiler before he scrapes together the cash for the Hyundai he\u0027s planning to slap it on.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe place is bustling. People hunch over listening stations and flip through stacks. Dick is behind the counter, in his element, cooing and laughing and directing traffic. I greet him and ask him to steer me toward something I might like. My qualifications (which I recorded on a note in my iPhone), are as follows: a) It must be a record I\u0027ve never heard before, b) It must not be available on Spotify, and c) It must give me this feeling that everyone around me at Rooky\u0027s seems to be accessing all the time. The feeling Dick gets when he dances—when everything sort of dissolves out of the way and, as he puts it, \u0022I could do a spin or a flip and feel like I could touch the ceiling.\u0022 The feeling of falling in love.\u000A\u000AI like 70s funk, so Dick calls over his resident expert, a guy named Jon Blunck, who helps out around the store sometimes. I give Jon a couple of starting points—Sly, Tower of Power—and he starts weaving through the aisles, pulling records. Before long, he\u0027s amassed a pile of about a dozen in front of Dick, who begins playing them for me on the store\u0027s sound system.\u000A\u000AFirst up is a band called Mandrill. The song, titled \u0022Fence Walk,\u0022 is from their 1972 self-titled LP. It\u0027s a tightly-wound workout with startling horn hits and a dexterous, plunking bass line. It\u0027s impressive, and certainly obscure enough, but something\u0027s off—it\u0027s too cheesy, too ostentatious. Next is \u0022The Cisco Kid\u0022 by War, followed by \u0022Work to Do\u0022 by the Isley Brothers. Both great songs, but both songs I recognize. Dick and Jon consult briefly, and Dick suggests a tune called \u0022Ain\u0027t No Woman\u0022 by the Four Tops. It\u0027s way off—too sweet, too pop, too sixties. Too Dick.\u000A\u000AFinally, Jon pulls out a record by The Chairmen of the Board, a band I\u0027ve never heard of. As I\u0027m scribbling notes about the previous song and trying to Spotify-check the one before it on my phone, he cues up a song called \u0022All We Need Is Understanding.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat happens next is hard to explain. It\u0027s hard to recall, too, because after about five seconds I put down my notebook and pen and close my eyes. I feel that thing—the feeling that makes Dick\u0027s customers delete their iTunes libraries and spend hours here every day, pawing through vinyl. The feeling Dick felt when he was 10. The feeling he craves, and runs from, and wants more than anything to share. The Dread\u0027s opposite.\u000A\u000AI give in, let the song play and the record crackle. I accept imperfection, finiteness. I let it spill over me like a glass of water poured carefully across a computer\u0027s keyboard.\u000A\u000AThen, after a minute, I open my eyes and ask Dick if he\u0027ll take a card.",

age of at-your-fingertips digital access to most any song ever recorded (we&#39;re looking at you, Spotify), Dick Vivian is a rarity: a man who believes in the absolute power of vinyl. As his San Francisco record store, Rooky Ricardo&#39;s, reaches its 26th anniversary, Vivian is ready as ever to help you overcome the most pernicious problem of Twenty-First Century music appreciation: too many choices</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.0"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d7353655c24c6c94b3e0/master/w_806/entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-01.jpg" alt="entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-01.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;t=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;t=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d7353655c24c6c94b3e0%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-01.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d7353655c24c6c94b3e0%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-01.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1">I first find myself in Rooky Ricardo&apos;s Records because I&apos;m trying to outrun The Dread. It hunted me, snarling and snapping, all the way here: across the San Francisco Bay, through downtown, up a couple of viciously steep hills that level off into the city&apos;s Lower Haight neighborhood. I&apos;m breathless and drenched in sweat. I&apos;ve been running all day. For months. Years, even.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.2">The Dread takes many savage forms&#x2014;a Netflix home screen, a Spotify search bar, the iTunes store&#x2014;but it always yields the same effect. It is the paralysis of infinite possibility, the moment of having everything and nothing all at once. It is the feeling of being an ape in space, gazing glassy-eyed into digital infinity. Today, in 2013, we are faced with almost incomprehensible access&#x2014;to music, movies and so much more&#x2014;and yet we are ironically stuck. I am here today because I&apos;ve heard about Dick Vivian, a man who helps us get unstuck.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.3">Dick&apos;s records are everything The Dread is not&#x2014;persnickety, fragile, imperfect, evanescent. They cannot be scrolled through effortlessly. They cannot be accumulated through massive, instantaneous transactions. They must be hoisted, stored, categorized, dusted, flipped and coddled. They must be fretted over. Most importantly, they must be purchased from Rooky&apos;s&#x2014;an actual <em>place </em>that contains actual <em>people </em>with whom you must converse in all sorts of imperfect, unguarded ways.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.5">This is the story of one such person&#x2014;his breathtaking kindness, his passion, his sadness, the things he hides. It is a story about The Dread and a man who spent a lifetime resisting it.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.6">This is a story about the closest thing we have to an antidote.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.7"> SIDE A Dick Vivian is very much in love, and he will do his best to make sure that you fall in love, too. At 65, he appears built for the task: Cupid belly, a powdered sugar dusting of beard on round cheeks, brown eyes always on the verge of a knowing wink. He knows the right buttons to push, too&#x2014;when to tease you about the length of your shorts, when to call you &quot;honey bunny.&quot; He will greet you with the sort of doting, half-concerned &quot;helloooo!&quot; a mother gives her son who has lost a little weight. He will remember how many slices of lemon you take in your iced tea. He will joke about wanting to marry you. He will offer you candy, which you will most likely accept.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.8">Dick will do all of this because he wants you to experience love the way he does&#x2014;unflinchingly, fiercely, naively. He first fell in love at the age of ten, while lying alone on his bed, and he has dedicated half of his life to recreating the feeling again and again. In Dick&apos;s view, we are all just a few crucial seconds away from tumbling head over heels.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.9">&quot;I view myself as a service,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t love everyone that walks in the door. But I want to make it work for them. I will help people find what they&apos;re looking for if I have it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.a">What Dick loves most are records&#x2014;45s, specifically&#x2014;and he loves them with a teen girl&apos;s fanatical ardor. In his home, he has more than 75,000, all categorized in a baroque, Cusackian way that only he understands. In Rooky Ricardo&apos;s, which he owns, he has about 40,000 more. The place is a 60s-era kitsch capsule: Chubby Checkers posters, toy bumper cars, two different rotary phones (one teal, one pink). The 45s themselves line walls, crowd shelves and sit in tidy stacks on the floor. So dire is this surplus that Dick&apos;s taken to nailing records with inadvertently prurient titles to the store&apos;s bathroom wall. They include, but are not limited to: &quot;Still No. 2&quot; by Ben Colder (MGM); &quot;I Go For You,&quot; Sammy Davis Jr. and Carmen McRae (Decca); and &quot;Got a Match?,&quot; Frank Gallup (Classic Records).</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.b">It&apos;s here at Rooky&apos;s, days away from the store&apos;s 26th anniversary, that Dick runs through the highlights and principles of a 55-year-old vinyl obsession. Sitting across from me at a repurposed diner table, he talks about his life-changing first listen of the Del-Vikings&apos; &quot;Whispering Bells&quot; (&quot;I thought I had died and gone to heaven.&quot;), why he doesn&apos;t carry anything by The Beatles (&quot;Do you know what a foodie is? Well there are record versions of that, and they want to ask me about a Beatles album so they can tell me about it.&quot;), and why he never got into LPs (&quot;What you lose is the warmth.&quot;). Dick doesn&apos;t know anything about rock or punk or jazz or classical, and he doesn&apos;t care to know. What he does know is soul and oldies, and especially girl groups from the 1960s&#x2014;acts like The Marvelettes, The Chirelles, Dolly and the Fashions and Maureen Gray. It is within this time period, with its bouffants and heartaches and brittle, delicately suggestive harmonies, that Dick prefers to linger. You are welcome to join him.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.c">On the store&apos;s cash machine, there&apos;s a mock-vintage magnet with a well-preened man&apos;s head floating above the slogan &quot;Everybody loves Dick!&quot; This is not an exaggeration. When he turned 50, 300 people came to his birthday party. He estimates that he has about 50 &quot;very close friends.&quot; As customers file into the store, it&apos;s very hard to discern who are bosom buddies and whom he is just now meeting for the first time. Jokes are cracked. Hugs are administered. The customer demographics fluctuate in the sort of turbulent, irresponsible way only San Francisco demographics can fluctuate: the mid-40s greaser/techie with arm tattoos and bright blue sneakers. The 25-year-old Sudanese PhD student. The brooding, unshaven collectors. The Swedish. Dick greets them all with that springy, buoyant &quot;helloooo!&quot; that sounds like it&apos;s been fired from a cartoon slingshot. He then sets about helping them, which typically is some combination of teasing and flirting.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.d"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d73609f0bee5644024ca/master/w_806/entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-07.jpg" alt="entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-07.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;t=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;t=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d73609f0bee5644024ca%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-07.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-07.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d73609f0bee5644024ca%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-07.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-07.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Dick:</strong> How are you today? You got a list for me?</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.f"> <strong>Customer: </strong>You don&apos;t remember me, huh?</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.g"> <strong>Dick (<em>purring</em>):</strong> I <em>do</em> remember you. <em>Of course</em> I do.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.h"> <strong>Customer: </strong>You sure?</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.i"> <strong>Dick:</strong> I&apos;m positive.

You <em>are </em>good.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.k"> <strong>Dick: </strong>Remember we almost got married?</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.l"> <strong>Customer: </strong>Yeah, we did. Why didn&apos;t that happen?</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.m"> <strong>Dick: </strong>Well, you gained a little weight, and so did I.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.n">It&apos;s common for customers to come in with handwritten wish lists. Dick will either direct them to a specific section or suggest something similar. &quot; &#x2018;Friday Night&apos; is probably in here,&quot; he says to this guy. &quot;I don&apos;t know Donny Burdick.&quot; Turning to me, he says, &quot;Probably half of what came out on 45s has never been documented. It&apos;s unobtainable. That&apos;s why my store is one of the many record stores that does well. It&apos;s because people can come in and make their own discoveries. Sometimes I guide them along, sometimes I can&apos;t help them.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.o">It&apos;s here that I ask my first stupid question&#x2014;the one that betrays my status as a Pandora-surfing, turntable-less 26-year-old technobrat. &quot;Do you order stuff for people?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.p">Dick looks quizzical. &quot;You can&apos;t order stuff. You have to find it, or it has to show up.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.q">For someone whose tastes and knowledge are as specific as Dick&apos;s, it&apos;s a very good time to be in the vinyl business. Sales of the medium have been climbing steadily for the past five years, and last April, 244,000 records were sold in one week&#x2014;the largest amount since Nielsen SoundScan started keeping track in 1991. In 2012, citizens of these United States purchased 4.6 million vinyl records&#x2014;an 18 percent increase from 2011. And this year, we&apos;re on pace for an even larger bump. Though digital music purchases still outpace records by a rate of about 50 to 1, the surge has been enough to help specialists like Dick carve out a niche for themselves.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.r">And carve he has. By 1960s terms&#x2014;the terms on which Dick operates in most facets of life&#x2014;Rooky Ricardo&apos;s is doing moderately well. But by 2013 terms, its performance is extraordinary. Dick doesn&apos;t like talking exact numbers (nor was he really keeping records before 2008), but suffice it to say that his business is growing steadily. On any given weekday, he can make more than what he made in a month ten years ago&#x2014;sometimes ten times as much. And last March, his biggest month ever, he pulled in close to $18,000.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.s">&quot;There was a period there where everybody got rid of their records and took that money and bought CDs,&quot; he says. &quot;They recreated their collection on CD. Now those same people are coming back, regretting that, and wanting to recreate the library that they once had on vinyl.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.t">In some ways, Dick has gotten this far simply by loving the same things he&apos;s always loved&#x2014;the harmonies, the horn stabs, the gentle innuendoes about candy and &quot;dancing&quot; all night. Customers come to him because they want soul and oldies, not because they&apos;re looking for Zeppelin rarities or abstruse jazz fusion. They want very specific things from a very specific era. They want to be welcomed and assisted and goaded lovingly. Basically, they want the sort of singularity only true love can afford, and they know Dick can help. &quot;I&apos;m the kind of restaurant that&apos;s got ten items,&quot; he explains. &quot;That&apos;s what I&apos;m selling. If you like that, you&apos;ll be in heaven. If you don&apos;t, then that&apos;s not for you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.u">The simple explanation of why Dick is doing better than ever is that his tastes are finally back in vogue. Trends sail on the winds of exclusivity, of being the first and only possessor, and accumulating rare 45s is a natural extension of this. The harder question to answer is why a generation of young people&#x2014;those with staggering, almost infinite access to free music&#x2014;are seeking out an experience as constrained and unpredictable as record collecting. With more media at our fingertips than at any time in the history of the world, why do we choose to limit our experience?</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.v">The answer is simple, says John Vanderslice, the San Francisco-based indie musician and record producer. Just like food, the songs we consume &quot;still have to be portioned out. Like, you have dinner at six. It&apos;s not like you just have this open buffet twenty-four hours a day in your house.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.w">Vanderslice is a Rooky Ricardo&apos;s regular and in many ways a musical purist. He does not keep a digital mixing console at Tiny Telephone, his studio in San Francisco&apos;s Mission District. He insists that artists record on two-inch reel-to-reel tape, and he aggressively limits the number of instruments available to them. When it comes to vinyl though, he&apos;s more of an omnivore.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.x">&quot;You have these twelve, fourteen, twenty records that you&apos;re just listening to in a loop&#x2014;shit, sometimes I just put on the same side over and over and over again,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&apos;t do that when I&apos;m listening to stuff on my computer, and I listen to shitloads of music. I listen to tons of music on my phone when I&apos;m hiking. It doesn&apos;t give me the same jolt. It doesn&apos;t provide the same experience to me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.y">This sort of consumption might be considered a sort of postmodern listening paradigm for the modern era&#x2014;part embrace of digital&apos;s omnipresence, part protest against the The Dread, which encroaches any time you try to settle on just <em>one</em> song from a 120-gig iTunes library. Many of Dick&apos;s customers&#x2014;the younger ones, especially&#x2014;are conversant in this mode of consumption. Records, unlike every other available music service&#x2014;indeed, unlike pretty much everything else that exists and is sold in 2013&#x2014;are desirable for what they <em>don&apos;t </em>possess.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.z">But Dick always knew this. He&apos;s just been waiting patiently for you to figure it out. If you don&apos;t come around, that&apos;s OK with him, too. He&apos;s never been one to judge.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.10">&quot;My store is now current,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s one of the most current stores in San Francisco. Each forty-five that you hold is a piece of history, and they sound the way they were meant to sound.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.11">But isn&apos;t that a judgment call?</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.12">Stupid question number two. Dick narrows his eyes at me.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.13">&quot;That&apos;s not a judgment call. That&apos;s the way it is.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.14"> SIDE B Dick Vivian is not in love with anyone, and he has not been in love for many years. He does not ever say it explicitly, but he fears heartbreak with the sort of ardent, poetic innocence normally reserved for oldies songs. He was an only child that never knew his father. He didn&apos;t see much of his mother, who worked full-time as a secretary. He is gay, and twice heartbroken&#x2014;first by his two life&apos;s loves, then by the AIDS virus that withered their bodies and ripped them prematurely out of this world. He has never married. These days, he says, the desire to meet somebody &quot;doesn&apos;t even cross my mind.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.15"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d7353655c24c6c94b3e6/master/w_806/entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-05.jpg" alt="entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-05.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;t=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;t=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d7353655c24c6c94b3e6%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-05.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d7353655c24c6c94b3e6%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-05.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.16">Dick lives alone on one floor of an enormous, impeccably maintained Victorian near the heart of San Francisco&apos;s Castro District. His home, like Rooky&apos;s, is a wistful sanctuary of 1960s-era bric-a-brac. The walls are adorned with classic movie posters and high school yearbook photos, and old films fill the shelves near his DVD player&#x2014;W.C. Fields collections, Abbott and Costello anthologies, etc. We sit in what he calls the &quot;Red Room,&quot; a maroon lounge with a flat screen TV, some mod furniture and, of course, a closet packed with 45s. It&apos;s here, in a space free from friends and strangers and any possible combination of the two, that Dick finally opens up about the many things he does not love.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.17">First up is his junior high experience. Maybe because he was not athletic, or because he was short, or because he had a voice like a parrot, Dick struggled to fit in. &quot;I went home crying every day,&quot; he remembers. In his time alone, he obsessed over top 40 Radio, falling asleep to it at night and poring over its weekly rankings pamphlets. His weekly $1 allowance invariably went toward buying records. With no siblings, the music became a sort of refuge for him, a respite from his own Dread. &quot;Records were always kind of my security,&quot; he says. &quot;I had friends like anyone else, but that was always my time alone.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.18">Around this time, two girls from Dick&apos;s class convinced him to learn a dance called &quot;the Bop&quot; with them. Something immediately clicked, and Dick set about learning as many dances as he could&#x2013; the Lindy Hop, the Mashed Potato, the Jitterbug&#x2014;which he says helped him impress girls and make friends throughout junior high and high school. He kept dancing after graduation, throughout college at San Jose State, and into his early twenties. During lunch breaks at his first job, he would duck into nearby clubs and learn what he could.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.19">Dick met Steve, the first man that he truly loved, at one of these dance clubs. The way Dick describes him, Steve was younger, and very religious, with a beautiful body and caring heart. He would listen to Dick in the same rapt way Dick listened to his 45s. He would show up, unprompted, with gifts. &quot;He was the first one who treated me like I dreamed someone in a relationship should be treated,&quot; Dick recalls. But this was the 1970s, and Dick still wanted the things he loved about the 1960s to be true. He wanted the story he had been told so many times, in so many iterations, by so many pop songs. Sex was not as important to him as emotional commitment was, &quot;and a lot of the people that I happened to fall in love with were so attractive that it&apos;s just natural that they&apos;re going to be out there.&quot; Steve strayed, and Dick couldn&apos;t keep on.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1a">Bill was a similar story. They met when Dick was 30, and Dick moved to San Francisco to be with him. The two stayed exclusive for a while, but now it was the 1980s, and the Castro was not the right place for Dick to hold onto a monogamous mate. Steve &quot;was so handsome and there were just so many people that liked him,&quot; Dick remembers. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to compete.&quot; After six good months and 12 bad ones, the two broke up.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1b">&quot;I think that may have caused him to opt out, because that really broke his heart,&quot; says Nick Waterhouse, an L.A.-based soul musician and one of Dick&apos;s closest friends. &quot;He didn&apos;t move to the Castro to <em>be there</em>. It was just that time. He didn&apos;t overly think it. He sees a lot of those male relationships as terminal.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1c">It&apos;s not that Dick hated the fact that he was gay; it&apos;s that he always felt cheated by the designation and its limitations&#x2014;especially in a place like the Castro, where flamboyancy often went hand in hand with social credibility. &quot;He philosophically does not see himself as &#x2018;gay,&apos; &quot; Waterhouse continues. &quot;He feels strongly that he&apos;s an individual.&quot; Back in the 80s, he would leave parties because everybody was calling each other &quot;Mary.&quot; &quot;He was like, &#x2018;There were so many goddamn Marys in the room, I didn&apos;t know what to do with myself.&apos;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1d">Around this time, Dick was working as a waiter at a popular gay restaurant called Alta Plaza in San Francisco&apos;s Presidio neighborhood. The AIDS epidemic was charging through the city, and as the years passed, he began to witness a heartbreaking progression: Couples would come in, fall in love, fall ill. Months would pass, then just one half of the couple would start showing up, sometimes with the other&apos;s family.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1e">One evening in the early nineties, Steve came in to say his goodbyes. Dick was knocked off guard. He had not seen his former partner sick. &quot;I just hugged him,&quot; Dick recalls. &quot;Then I had to&#x2014;story of my life&#x2014;go right back in.&quot; As he returned to one of his tables, a woman looked up from her menu and brayed, &quot;I&apos;ll have the chicken!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1f">It&apos;s at this point in the story that Dick looks exhausted for the first time since we met. All the cheeriness he emits at the store&#x2014;all the social sophistication and instincts that half a century of waiting on customers affords him&#x2014;seems to drain away momentarily. It&apos;s not that he looks uncommonly ancient; it&apos;s that he finally looks exactly as old as he is.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1g">&quot;I&apos;m sure a lot of those feelings kind of barricade me up,&quot; he says. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;m shut down, because I still love my life. There are so many people in my world that are fresh and vibrant and alive. That&apos;s what I feed off of. Not as a couple. Just as another person to make my life interesting.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1h">Dick&apos;s Dread is different from ours, but it stalks around the periphery of similar things: a fear of insignificance, of being marooned, of exiting life without having truly held onto something. To look around his house&#x2014;and Rooky&apos;s, for that matter&#x2014;is to bear witness to his towering, impressive defense against it. He&apos;s cocooned himself in an era he understands and surrounded himself with people he knows won&apos;t hurt him. The heartbreak he does allow himself to still experience comes in a format he&apos;s familiar with: two songs at a time, with a quick break in the middle.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1i"> LINER NOTES I return to Rooky&apos;s on a rainy Sunday, biking up those ruthless hills with a modest but daunting goal: to choose my first record. I still don&apos;t have a turntable, but I plan to buy one soon, so I figure my purchase is about as excusable as a teenager buying a custom spoiler before he scrapes together the cash for the Hyundai he&apos;s planning to slap it on.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1j"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d73609f0bee5644024c7/master/w_806/entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-06.jpg" alt="entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-06.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;t=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;t=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d73609f0bee5644024c7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-06.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-06.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Frooky-ricardo-dick-vivian-san-francisco&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d73609f0bee5644024c7%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-06.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2013-08-rooky-rooky-ricardo-06.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1k">The place is bustling. People hunch over listening stations and flip through stacks. Dick is behind the counter, in his element, cooing and laughing and directing traffic. I greet him and ask him to steer me toward something I might like. My qualifications (which I recorded on a note in my iPhone), are as follows: a) It must be a record I&apos;ve never heard before, b) It must not be available on Spotify, and c) It must give me this feeling that everyone around me at Rooky&apos;s seems to be accessing all the time. The feeling Dick gets when he dances&#x2014;when everything sort of dissolves out of the way and, as he puts it, &quot;I could do a spin or a flip and feel like I could touch the ceiling.&quot; The feeling of falling in love.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1l">I like 70s funk, so Dick calls over his resident expert, a guy named Jon Blunck, who helps out around the store sometimes. I give Jon a couple of starting points&#x2014;Sly, Tower of Power&#x2014;and he starts weaving through the aisles, pulling records. Before long, he&apos;s amassed a pile of about a dozen in front of Dick, who begins playing them for me on the store&apos;s sound system.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1m">First up is a band called Mandrill. The song, titled &quot;Fence Walk,&quot; is from their 1972 self-titled LP. It&apos;s a tightly-wound workout with startling horn hits and a dexterous, plunking bass line. It&apos;s impressive, and certainly obscure enough, but something&apos;s off&#x2014;it&apos;s too cheesy, too ostentatious. Next is &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; by War, followed by &quot;Work to Do&quot; by the Isley Brothers. Both great songs, but both songs I recognize. Dick and Jon consult briefly, and Dick suggests a tune called &quot;Ain&apos;t No Woman&quot; by the Four Tops. It&apos;s way off&#x2014;too sweet, too pop, too sixties. Too Dick.</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1n">Finally, Jon pulls out a record by The Chairmen of the Board, a band I&apos;ve never heard of. As I&apos;m scribbling notes about the previous song and trying to Spotify-check the one before it on my phone, he cues up a song called &quot;All We Need Is Understanding.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".kokzfgphc0.1.1.0.0.4.1o">What happens next is hard to explain. It&apos;s hard to recall, too, because after about five seconds I put down my notebook and pen and close my eyes. I feel that <em>thing</em>&#x2014;the feeling that makes Dick&apos;s customers delete their iTunes libraries and spend hours here every day, pawing through vinyl. The feeling Dick felt when he was 10. The feeling he craves, and runs from, and wants more than anything to share.
