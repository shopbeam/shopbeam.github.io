  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAbout a year ago, I wrote a piece here bemoaning the eternal loss of the Durant/Westbrook/Harden OKC Thunder. The gist wasn\u0027t necessarily that the team was better with Harden—of course it was—but more that there was some inspirational nugget there that the Thunder could never recapture. They played beautifully and put up games that made your hair stand on end. It\u0027s hard to not have some lingering attachment to that kind of basketball assemblage.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s an oft-misplaced bit of history that when the Thunder had those three offensive demigods together, they also had Serge Ibaka. Granted, Ibaka was still coming into his own and was almost certainly a lesser being than the others. Yet any measure of that team\u0027s success had to take into account what Serge brought to the table on defense. That hasn\u0027t changed since Harden left. If anything, it\u0027s only gotten more pronounced as Ibaka has improved as a player at both ends. And following Ibaka\u0027s dramatic return to the playoffs, one has to wonder if Ibaka is the new Harden.\u000A\u000A There\u0027s no way to understate how important Ibaka is to the Thunder on defense. He is their defense. Without him, the team is easy prey for San Antonio. Assuming Ibaka can remain healthy, the Thunder can make a series of it. The team has survived without James Harden. They can\u0027t without Serge.\u000A\u000A But there\u0027s another part of the story, one that everyone lauding Ibaka\u0027s defensive contributions will overlook. Ibaka isn\u0027t just key to the Thunder defense. He\u0027s also, a jolt of electricity for the entire team, igniting the offense in the same way that all great turnover-creators do. As Ibaka has matured, he hasn\u0027t just acquired a jump shot, he\u0027s integrated himself more fully into the Thunder\u0027s overall concept. With that, he\u0027s come to occupy exactly the same kind of niche that Harden once did: the guy who helps things come together, who at his best helps Durant and Westbrook attain even greater heights. If Durant is the star soloist and Westbrook the eccentric sideman, then Ibaka is the bassline, holding everything steady while helping kick it into another gear. That, more than all the scoring, was always Harden\u0027s most important contribution.\u000A\u000A That\u0027s why, coming off of Game 3, picking between Harden and Ibaka (no way the Thunder could have kept both without seriously blowing through the salary cap) is less a compromise, more a self-imposed Sophie\u0027s Choice between two catalytic players. Except you could make the argument that Ibaka adds a dimension to the team while Harden had become almost redundant, albeit in a totally awesome way. When the Spurs are scoring inside at will, would another dynamic offensive player really make a difference? Ibaka, on the other hand, is a one-man wrecking crew who keeps opposing teams from ever feeling truly comfortable in the paint. His blocks in Sunday\u0027s game might as well have been tomahawk dunks. And in general, he provided a valuable reminder into just how exciting this team can be when everyone\u0027s healthy. For all the fireworks Durant and Westbrook bring to the table, they can\u0027t win games with offense alone; the Thunder were extremely good this year without Westbrook, yet without Ibaka, there\u0027s a humongous hole sitting right there to exploit. Yes, the Harden Thunder beat the Spurs in 2012 but again, that team was also the Ibaka Thunder, maybe even more than we realized at the time.\u000A\u000A Durant is the league\u0027s MVP, an award that no one has been able to adequately explain but just makes sense when you see it. Certainly, the Thunder without Durant are slight and unthinkable. But Ibaka raises another possibility: That there are players less grand than KD, and even Westbrook, who we may still want to talk about as indispensable. It\u0027s not the grunt work of role players; it\u0027s guys who are structurally central to what a team does even if they aren\u0027t the most glamorous performers. Calling them the glue that holds things together or the solid foundation downplays just how much they are responsible for the flashy stuff. You can have offense without defense but for offense to really click, it has to have a logic, an order to it. For the Thunder, that\u0027s very often a matter of Ibaka blocking shots or just generally intimidating in the paint, which in turn makes it easier for the rest of the Thunder to get out running in the opposite direction. Harden was notable for giving the offense some coherence; maybe now, it\u0027s Ibaka we should think of that way.\u000A\u000A All this might sound like hyperbole, given that Ibaka only went for 15 points, 7 boards and 4 blocks against San Antonio. You could also argue that his presence was amplified by the emotional rush of return: OKC was whole again, hope was within sight, a season was no longer set to expire on a disappointing note. Still, what made Ibaka\u0027s game different from other pseudo-Willis Reed performances of the last few years was that he actually mattered from beginning to end. There was no one else on OKC who could do what Ibaka did. And when you take into account the load he\u0027s expected to shoulder on defense, few players in the league would be up to the task.\u000A\u000A Ibaka\u0027s return, emphatic as it was, still came with the Thunder in an 0-2 series hole. Heading into Game 4—and again, assuming Ibaka\u0027s calf holds up—we can at least expect a competitive series from here on out. Whether it\u0027s going to be too late to make a difference is another question altogether. But in the process, we\u0027re finding out just how badly they need Ibaka. It\u0027s never been a secret that he anchored the defense, but just how much of an impact his absence would have has come as something of a shock. And more importantly, we\u0027re learning that our acceptance of him—in the sense that James Harden\u0027s ghost is still fresh for some people—doesn\u0027t have to be grudging. Ibaka is part of what makes the high-flying OKC team play the way they do. A healthy Ibaka doesn\u0027t just make for a competitive series, it makes for a more beautiful one.",

wrote a piece <a href="../blogs/the-feed/2013/05/i-still-miss-okcs-big-three.html">here</a> bemoaning the eternal loss of the Durant/Westbrook/Harden OKC Thunder. The gist wasn&#x2019;t necessarily that the team was better with Harden&#x2014;of course it was&#x2014;but more that there was some inspirational nugget there that the Thunder could never recapture. They played beautifully and put up games that made your hair stand on end. It&#x2019;s hard to not have some lingering attachment to that kind of basketball assemblage.</p><p data-reactid=".1oaq6gkk2yo.1.1.0.0.4.2"> It&#x2019;s an oft-misplaced bit of history that when the Thunder had those three offensive demigods together, they also had Serge Ibaka. Granted, Ibaka was still coming into his own and was almost certainly a lesser being than the others. Yet any measure of that team&#x2019;s success had to take into account what Serge brought to the table on defense. That hasn&#x2019;t changed since Harden left. If anything, it&#x2019;s only gotten more pronounced as Ibaka has improved as a player at both ends. And following Ibaka&#x2019;s dramatic return to the playoffs, one has to wonder if Ibaka is the new Harden.</p><p data-reactid=".1oaq6gkk2yo.1.1.0.0.4.3"> There&#x2019;s no way to understate how important Ibaka is to the Thunder on defense. He<em> is</em> their defense. Without him, the team is easy prey for San Antonio. Assuming Ibaka can remain healthy, the Thunder can make a series of it. The team has survived without James Harden. They can&#x2019;t without Serge.</p><p data-reactid=".1oaq6gkk2yo.1.1.0.0.4.5"> But there&#x2019;s another part of the story, one that everyone lauding Ibaka&#x2019;s defensive contributions will overlook. Ibaka isn&#x2019;t just key to the Thunder defense. He&#x2019;s also, a jolt of electricity for the entire team, igniting the offense in the same way that all great turnover-creators do. As Ibaka has matured, he hasn&#x2019;t just acquired a jump shot, he&#x2019;s integrated himself more fully into the Thunder&#x2019;s overall concept. With that, he&#x2019;s come to occupy exactly the same kind of niche that Harden once did: the guy who helps things come together, who at his best helps Durant and Westbrook attain even greater heights. If Durant is the star soloist and Westbrook the eccentric sideman, then Ibaka is the bassline, holding everything steady while helping kick it into another gear. That, more than all the scoring, was always Harden&#x2019;s most important contribution.</p><p data-reactid=".1oaq6gkk2yo.1.1.0.0.4.6"> That&#x2019;s why, coming off of Game 3, picking between Harden and Ibaka (no way the Thunder could have kept both without seriously blowing through the salary cap) is less a compromise, more a self-imposed Sophie&#x2019;s Choice between two catalytic players. Except you could make the argument that Ibaka adds a dimension to the team while Harden had become almost redundant, albeit in a totally awesome way. When the Spurs are scoring inside at will, would another dynamic offensive player really make a difference? Ibaka, on the other hand, is a one-man wrecking crew who keeps opposing teams from ever feeling truly comfortable in the paint. His blocks in Sunday&#x2019;s game might as well have been tomahawk dunks. And in general, he provided a valuable reminder into just how exciting this team can be when everyone&#x2019;s healthy. For all the fireworks Durant and Westbrook bring to the table, they can&#x2019;t win games with offense alone; the Thunder were extremely good this year without Westbrook, yet without Ibaka, there&#x2019;s a humongous hole sitting right there to exploit. Yes, the Harden Thunder beat the Spurs in 2012 but again, that team was also the Ibaka Thunder, maybe even more than we realized at the time.</p><p data-reactid=".1oaq6gkk2yo.1.1.0.0.4.7"> Durant is the league&#x2019;s MVP, an award that no one has been able to adequately explain but just makes sense when you see it. Certainly, the Thunder without Durant are slight and unthinkable. But Ibaka raises another possibility: That there are players less grand than KD, and even Westbrook, who we may still want to talk about as indispensable. It&#x2019;s not the grunt work of role players; it&#x2019;s guys who are structurally central to what a team does even if they aren&#x2019;t the most glamorous performers. Calling them the glue that holds things together or the solid foundation downplays just how much they are responsible for the flashy stuff. You can have offense without defense but for offense to really click, it has to have a logic, an order to it. For the Thunder, that&#x2019;s very often a matter of Ibaka blocking shots or just generally intimidating in the paint, which in turn makes it easier for the rest of the Thunder to get out running in the opposite direction. Harden was notable for giving the offense some coherence; maybe now, it&#x2019;s Ibaka we should think of that way.</p><p data-reactid=".1oaq6gkk2yo.1.1.0.0.4.8"> All this might sound like hyperbole, given that Ibaka only went for 15 points, 7 boards and 4 blocks against San Antonio. You could also argue that his presence was amplified by the emotional rush of return: OKC was whole again, hope was within sight, a season was no longer set to expire on a disappointing note. Still, what made Ibaka&#x2019;s game different from other pseudo-Willis Reed performances of the last few years was that he actually mattered from beginning to end. There was no one else on OKC who could do what Ibaka did. And when you take into account the load he&#x2019;s expected to shoulder on defense, few players in the league would be up to the task.</p><p data-reactid=".1oaq6gkk2yo.1.1.0.0.4.9"> Ibaka&#x2019;s return, emphatic as it was, still came with the Thunder in an 0-2 series hole. Heading into Game 4&#x2014;and again, assuming Ibaka&#x2019;s calf holds up&#x2014;we can at least expect a competitive series from here on out. Whether it&#x2019;s going to be too late to make a difference is another question altogether. But in the process, we&#x2019;re finding out just how badly they need Ibaka. It&#x2019;s never been a secret that he anchored the defense, but just how much of an impact his absence would have has come as something of a shock. And more importantly, we&#x2019;re learning that our acceptance of him&#x2014;in the sense that James Harden&#x2019;s ghost is still fresh for some people&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t have to be grudging. Ibaka is part of what makes the high-flying OKC team play the way they do. A healthy Ibaka doesn&#x2019;t just make for a competitive series, it makes for a more beautiful one.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1oaq6gkk2yo.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
