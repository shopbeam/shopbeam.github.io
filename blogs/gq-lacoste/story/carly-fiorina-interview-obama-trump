  	    "articleBody": "Carly Fiorina is having a moment. After dominating the GOP\u0027s kids-table debate last week, she\u0027s surging in the polls and is suddenly being treated as a serious contender for the nomination.\u000A\u000AEarlier today, I got Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, on the phone to talk with me about why she thinks ousted business executives are better than politicians, how President Obama fights as dirty as Donald Trump, and what she\u0027s got in common with Oprah and Walt Disney. Here\u0027s a lightly edited and condensed transcript of our conversation.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AJZ: In hindsight, was it a blessing to be relegated to the undercard debate? And do you have any qualms about making it onto the main stage in California next month?  \u000A\u000ACF: Well, look, I thought of last Thursday as an opportunity to introduce myself. Going into that debate, less than 40 percent of Republican voters had ever heard my name. I had the lowest name ID in the field. I\u0027m not a celebrity and I\u0027m not a professional politician, so it was an opportunity and I wanted to take advantage of that opportunity, and I\u0027m obviously really encouraged by the momentum and the support we have coming out of that. And, no, I have no trepidation about being on the main stage in September.\u000A\u000AJZ: Obviously Donald Trump, in the first main-stage debate, dominated the forum. He has had a lot of nasty things to say about all of his various opponents, but I believe you\u0027re the only one he\u0027s said gives him a headache. Do you think that\u0027s a sexist comment?  \u000A\u000ACF: You\u0027ll have to ask Donald Trump. I\u0027m not particularly worried about every comment that he or anyone else makes.\u000A\u000AJZ: Do you think Donald Trump treats women worse than men?\u000A\u000ACF: You\u0027d have to ask him. I don\u0027t spend a lot of time analyzing or even observing Donald Trump.\u000A\u000AJZ: But you have actually made some observations about him in the last few days, about how what he said is not helpful to the Republican Party. Do you feel any particular responsibility as the only female candidate in the GOP field to stand up to him on gender issues?\u000A\u000ACF: Well, as I said on Friday night, there are certain comments for which there is no excuse. There was no excuse for his comments about Megyn Kelly. Likewise, there are other politicians who are equally below the belt. I said there was no excuse for President Obama calling anyone who opposes his Iranian deal the equivalent of the Iranian hardliners who are chanting \u0022Death to America.\u0022 There are politicians in both parties, unfortunately, who paint with a broad brush, who use insulting or demeaning language, and it\u0027s never helpful, it\u0027s never helpful. On the other hand, my job is to continue to get out there and meet as many people as I can and make sure they understand who I am and what I will do as President of the United States. And I think what a presidential campaign does is reveal character, over time and under pressure. Over time and under pressure, voters get to see what somebody\u0027s made of.\u000A\u000AJZ: You said that Hillary Clinton\u0027s \u0022character is flawed.\u0022 Do you not view that as a below-the-belt comment? Why is that defensible and what Trump said and what President Obama said are not?\u000A\u000ACF: I have been very fact-based and specific in my criticisms of Hillary Clinton. Those are your words, not mine. What I have said, which is fact-based and specific, is that she has lied about Benghazi, her emails, and her server. All those things are factually correct. I have said that she lacks a track record of accomplishment. That is factually correct. I have also said that based on her statements and her track record that she is not trustworthy, and obviously the majority of Americans agree with me. So I will always endeavor to be fact-based and specific.\u000A\u000AJZ: You did say that \u0022her character is flawed.\u0022 Do you think that\u0027s a fact-based judgment?\u000A\u000ACF: I don\u0027t know the specific words that you\u0027re referring to.\u000A\u000AJZ: In terms of Clinton\u0027s record as Secretary of State, which you\u0027ve obviously been quite critical of, a lot of business analysts have been quite critical of your tenure as Hewlett-Packard CEO. During your time there, the company\u0027s stock went down and you ended up being fired. How is your record at HP better than Hillary Clinton\u0027s at Foggy Bottom?\u000A\u000ACF: At HP, we have a record of results. So let me just give you a few of them, and by the way, these are not disputable, because in business, unlike politics, you have to report your results, every three months. As the chief executive of a publicly traded company, I was accountable every 90 days for every single result, and I was criminally liable if we misreported any of those results.\u000A\u000ASo the results of my six-year tenure at Hewlett-Packard are these: We doubled the size of the company to almost 90 billion. We quadrupled its topline revenue growth. We quadrupled its cash flow. We tripled innovation to almost 15 patents a day. We went from lagging behind in every product category and every market segment to leading in every product category and every market segment. Yes, our stock was down. So was the vast majority of the technology stock index. In fact, you may remember that the NASDAQ, the technology-heavy stock index, only in June recovered to its dot-com boom highs.\u000A\u000AI led HP through a very difficult time—the dot-com bust, post-9/11, the worst technology recession in 25 years. Many of the competitors that we were up against when I arrived at Hewlett-Packard literally don\u0027t exist anymore. Those results are crystal clear for anyone who bothers to look at them, and I think it\u0027s quite a notable track record of success. And, yes, I have been upfront from the day it happened: I got fired, in a boardroom brawl, because I made a couple enemies on the board. It is what happens when you challenge the status quo, and it is why Steve Jobs called me that very day and said, \u0022I\u0027ve been fired twice. That\u0027s what happens when you rattle people\u0027s cages.\u0022 And it\u0027s why Oprah Winfrey was fired and Mike Bloomberg was fired and Walt Disney was fired. It is what happens. Nonetheless, my tenure was actually twice as long as the average tenure of a chief executive at that time in the industry.\u000A\u000AJZ:  Back in 2008, you got in some hot water for saying that Sarah Palin and John McCain—who you were campaigning for at the time—couldn\u0027t run a major corporation. But then you qualified your remarks by saying that \u0022a major corporation is not the same as being the president or vice president of the United States. It is a fallacy to suggest that the country is like a company.\u0022 Do you still believe that? And if you do, what qualifies you to be president?\u000A\u000ACF: Well, I also said, by the way, that Barack Obama and Joe Biden couldn\u0027t have run Hewlett-Packard.\u000A\u000AJZ: I know. You said that no politician could and that it didn\u0027t matter.\u000A\u000ACF: The media always ignores. Look, ours was intended to be a citizen government, okay? To run a 90 billion dollar firm takes a set of technical expertise that you build over time. You know, I can\u0027t fly a jet airplane tomorrow, either. That job also takes technical expertise. And I actually think that the technical expertise that I have developed as chief executive at Hewlett-Packard is directly relatable to the federal government. Eighty percent of the American people now think that we have a professional political class that is more concerned about the protection of its own privilege and position than on getting anything done. And if you look at the facts of the federal government, the American people are right.\u000A\u000AWhatever side of the aisle you\u0027re on, the federal government is bloated, incompetent, and inept now. We have no idea how our money is getting spent. We have 25 agencies, just as one example, that were supposed to be minding the store during the financial crisis, and every one of them fell asleep at the switch. We have the EPA now admitting that, \u0022Whoops, sorry, we\u0027re the ones behind this terrible environmental spill in Colorado.\u0022 We have the Office of Personnel Management that cannot repel a cyber-attack from the Chinese when we have known for at least 12 years that the Chinese were trying to hack into that very system. I know that because I served as the chairman of the advisory board of the CIA, and we talked about it at the time. So I think the vast majority of the American people want government to be more competent, because they are tired of government ineptitude and incompetence.\u000A\u000AJZ: So you do now think that the country is like a company in that respect? That managing a corporation would give you the experience you need to run the government?\u000A\u000ACF: I am keenly aware of the fact that the government is very different from a business. We have three co-equal branches of government for example. That doesn\u0027t exist in a business. But there are skills and disciplines that come from business that help any organization, whether it\u0027s government or charity or an education system. So let me give you a couple examples. Knowing where your money is being spent is really helpful. We don\u0027t have a clue how our money is being spent today in the federal government, so we can\u0027t prioritize it. That\u0027s why the government always asks for more money when you ask them to do something important, even though they spend more money year after year. So in government terms, that would be called zero-based budgeting. We actually have to ask agencies to justify every dollar they spend every year. That\u0027s a tool and discipline that comes from business. I think it would be exceptionally helpful in government. And by the way, the vast majority of Americans agree with me.\u000A\u000AHere\u0027s another example of a tool that comes from business: holding people accountable. Holding people accountable for what they produce. In government today, you can sit in your job—and we know this from inspector general reports—you can sit in your job and watch pornography all day long and earn the same pay, pension, and benefits as somebody trying to do a good job. That lack of accountability is corrosive, and I think most Americans would say we need to hold people accountable in the federal government.\u000A\u000AJZ:  You mentioned \u0022the political class\u0022 and how you\u0027re not a member of it, but you\u0027ve given almost $200,000 in political donations over the years. That\u0027s in addition to the more than $5 million you spent on your own Senate race. Why were you so generous to members of that political class if you have such disdain for it?\u000A\u000ACF: Well, because I was hopeful that individuals could make a difference, and individuals do make a difference, and there are candidates that I have supported that I think have tried to make a difference. I\u0027m not disdainful of individuals, but I am aware of the fact that the status quo, in any setting, is very powerful. That was true at Hewlett-Packard when I arrived as well. In other words, people who benefited from a certain system get captured by the system, and people work really hard to preserve the status quo. And so I think we are now at a point, where we actually do need to return to a citizen government.\u000A\u000ASomehow we\u0027ve gotten used to this idea that you had to be a professional politician in order to run for office. Why? It\u0027s not the way our country was founded. It\u0027s not the way our country operated for much of its history. So why is it that we come to accept, \u0022oh, no, no, no, you have to be a politician all your life to run for political office.\u0022 It\u0027s not the way this country was meant to run.\u000A\u000AJZ: If you were to win the nomination, would you therefore not pick as your running mate a professional politician? Would you go for another regular citizen?\u000A\u000ACF: Well, I think we have a long time to answer that question.\u000A\u000AJZ: So Fiorina-Carson is not on the horizon?\u000A\u000ACF: I\u0027m making no predictions about what I will do as the nominee. And don\u0027t put words into my mouth!\u000A\u000A[Jason Zengerle](http://www.gq.com/contributor/jason-zengerle) is GQ\u0027s Political Correspondent",

data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.0">Carly Fiorina is having a moment. After <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/06/politics/carly-fiorina-republican-debate/">dominating</a> the GOP&apos;s kids-table debate last week, she&apos;s <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/polls-carly-fiorina-john-kasich-debate-2015-8">surging in the polls</a> and is suddenly being treated as a serious contender for the nomination.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.1">Earlier today, I got Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, on the phone to talk with me about why she thinks ousted business executives are better than politicians, how President Obama fights as dirty as Donald Trump, and what she&apos;s got in common with Oprah and Walt Disney. Here&apos;s a lightly edited and condensed transcript of our conversation.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.2"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>JZ: In hindsight, was it a blessing to be relegated to the undercard debate? And do you have any qualms about making it onto the main stage in California next month?</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.5">CF: Well, look, I thought of last Thursday as an opportunity to introduce myself. Going into that debate, less than 40 percent of Republican voters had ever heard my name. I had the lowest name ID in the field. I&apos;m not a celebrity and I&apos;m not a professional politician, so it was an opportunity and I wanted to take advantage of that opportunity, and I&apos;m obviously really encouraged by the momentum and the support we have coming out of that. And, no, I have no trepidation about being on the main stage in September.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>JZ: Obviously Donald Trump, in the first main-stage debate, dominated the forum. He has had a lot of nasty things to say about all of his various opponents, but I believe you&apos;re the only one he&apos;s said gives him a headache. Do you think that&apos;s a sexist comment?</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.7">CF: You&apos;ll have to ask Donald Trump. I&apos;m not particularly worried about every comment that he or anyone else makes.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>JZ: Do you think Donald Trump treats women worse than men?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.9">CF: You&apos;d have to ask him. I don&apos;t spend a lot of time analyzing or even observing Donald Trump.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>JZ: But you have actually made some observations about him in the last few days, about how what he said is not helpful to the Republican Party. Do you feel any particular responsibility as the only female candidate in the GOP field to stand up to him on gender issues?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.b">CF: Well, as I said on Friday night, there are certain comments for which there is no excuse. There was no excuse for his comments about Megyn Kelly. Likewise, there are other politicians who are equally below the belt. I said there was no excuse for President Obama calling anyone who opposes his Iranian deal the equivalent of the Iranian hardliners who are chanting &quot;Death to America.&quot; There are politicians in both parties, unfortunately, who paint with a broad brush, who use insulting or demeaning language, and it&apos;s never helpful, it&apos;s never helpful. On the other hand, my job is to continue to get out there and meet as many people as I can and make sure they understand who I am and what I will do as President of the United States. And I think what a presidential campaign does is reveal character, over time and under pressure. Over time and under pressure, voters get to see what somebody&apos;s made of.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>JZ: You said that Hillary Clinton&apos;s &quot;character is flawed.&quot; Do you not view that as a below-the-belt comment? Why is that defensible and what Trump said and what President Obama said are not?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.d">CF: I have been very fact-based and specific in my criticisms of Hillary Clinton. Those are your words, not mine. What I have said, which is fact-based and specific, is that she has lied about Benghazi, her emails, and her server. All those things are factually correct. I have said that she lacks a track record of accomplishment. That is factually correct. I have also said that based on her statements and her track record that she is not trustworthy, and obviously the majority of Americans agree with me. So I will always endeavor to be fact-based and specific.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>JZ: You did say that</strong> <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/03/29/her-character-is-flawed-gop-dark-horse-slams-hillary-clinton-promises-to-root-out-pornographic-government-waste/"><strong>&quot;her character is flawed.&quot;</strong></a> <strong>Do you think that&apos;s a fact-based judgment?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.f">CF: I don&apos;t know the specific words that you&apos;re referring to.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>JZ: In terms of Clinton&apos;s record as Secretary of State, which you&apos;ve obviously been quite critical of, a lot of business analysts have been quite critical of your tenure as Hewlett-Packard CEO. During your time there, the company&apos;s stock went down and you ended up being fired. How is your record at HP better than Hillary Clinton&apos;s at Foggy Bottom?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.h">CF: At HP, we have a record of results. So let me just give you a few of them, and by the way, these are not disputable, because in business, unlike politics, you have to report your results, every three months. As the chief executive of a publicly traded company, I was accountable every 90 days for every single result, and I was criminally liable if we misreported any of those results.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.i">So the results of my six-year tenure at Hewlett-Packard are these: We doubled the size of the company to almost 90 billion. We quadrupled its topline revenue growth. We quadrupled its cash flow. We tripled innovation to almost 15 patents a day. We went from lagging behind in every product category and every market segment to leading in every product category and every market segment. Yes, our stock was down. So was the vast majority of the technology stock index. In fact, you may remember that the NASDAQ, the technology-heavy stock index, only in June recovered to its dot-com boom highs.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.j">I led HP through a very difficult time&#x2014;the dot-com bust, post-9/11, the worst technology recession in 25 years. Many of the competitors that we were up against when I arrived at Hewlett-Packard literally don&apos;t exist anymore. Those results are crystal clear for anyone who bothers to look at them, and I think it&apos;s quite a notable track record of success. And, yes, I have been upfront from the day it happened: I got fired, in a boardroom brawl, because I made a couple enemies on the board. It is what happens when you challenge the status quo, and it is why Steve Jobs called me that very day and said, &quot;I&apos;ve been fired twice. That&apos;s what happens when you rattle people&apos;s cages.&quot; And it&apos;s why Oprah Winfrey was fired and Mike Bloomberg was fired and Walt Disney was fired. It is what happens. Nonetheless, my tenure was actually twice as long as the average tenure of a chief executive at that time in the industry.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>JZ:</strong>  <strong>Back in 2008, you got in some hot water for saying that Sarah Palin and John McCain&#x2014;who you were campaigning for at the time&#x2014;couldn&apos;t run a major corporation. But then</strong> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/16/fiorina.mccain/"><strong>you qualified your remarks</strong></a> <strong>by saying that &quot;a major corporation is not the same as being the president or vice president of the United States. It is a fallacy to suggest that the country is like a company.&quot; Do you still believe that? And if you do, what qualifies you to be president?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.l">CF: Well, I also said, by the way, that Barack Obama and Joe Biden couldn&apos;t have run Hewlett-Packard.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>JZ: I know. You said that no politician could and that it didn&apos;t matter.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.n">CF: The media always ignores. Look, ours was intended to be a citizen government, okay? To run a 90 billion dollar firm takes a set of technical expertise that you build over time. You know, I can&apos;t fly a jet airplane tomorrow, either. That job also takes technical expertise. And I actually think that the technical expertise that I have developed as chief executive at Hewlett-Packard is directly relatable to the federal government. Eighty percent of the American people now think that we have a professional political class that is more concerned about the protection of its own privilege and position than on getting anything done. And if you look at the facts of the federal government, the American people are right.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.o">Whatever side of the aisle you&apos;re on, the federal government is bloated, incompetent, and inept now. We have no idea how our money is getting spent. We have 25 agencies, just as one example, that were supposed to be minding the store during the financial crisis, and every one of them fell asleep at the switch. We have the EPA now admitting that, &quot;Whoops, sorry, we&apos;re the ones behind this terrible environmental spill in Colorado.&quot; We have the Office of Personnel Management that cannot repel a cyber-attack from the Chinese when we have known for at least 12 years that the Chinese were trying to hack into that very system. I know that because I served as the chairman of the advisory board of the CIA, and we talked about it at the time. So I think the vast majority of the American people want government to be more competent, because they are tired of government ineptitude and incompetence.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>JZ: So you do now think that the country is like a company in that respect? That managing a corporation would give you the experience you need to run the government?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.q">CF: I am keenly aware of the fact that the government is very different from a business. We have three co-equal branches of government for example. That doesn&apos;t exist in a business. But there are skills and disciplines that come from business that help any organization, whether it&apos;s government or charity or an education system. So let me give you a couple examples. Knowing where your money is being spent is really helpful. We don&apos;t have a clue how our money is being spent today in the federal government, so we can&apos;t prioritize it. That&apos;s why the government always asks for more money when you ask them to do something important, even though they spend more money year after year. So in government terms, that would be called zero-based budgeting. We actually have to ask agencies to justify every dollar they spend every year. That&apos;s a tool and discipline that comes from business. I think it would be exceptionally helpful in government. And by the way, the vast majority of Americans agree with me.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.r">Here&apos;s another example of a tool that comes from business: holding people accountable. Holding people accountable for what they produce. In government today, you can sit in your job&#x2014;and we know this from inspector general reports&#x2014;you can sit in your job and watch pornography all day long and earn the same pay, pension, and benefits as somebody trying to do a good job. That lack of accountability is corrosive, and I think most Americans would say we need to hold people accountable in the federal government.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>JZ:</strong>  <strong>You mentioned &quot;the political class&quot; and how you&apos;re not a member of it, but you&apos;ve given almost $200,000 in political donations over the years. That&apos;s in addition to the more than $5 million you spent on your own Senate race. Why were you so generous to members of that political class if you have such disdain for it?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.t">CF: Well, because I was hopeful that individuals could make a difference, and individuals do make a difference, and there are candidates that I have supported that I think have tried to make a difference. I&apos;m not disdainful of individuals, but I am aware of the fact that the status quo, in any setting, is very powerful. That was true at Hewlett-Packard when I arrived as well. In other words, people who benefited from a certain system get captured by the system, and people work really hard to preserve the status quo. And so I think we are now at a point, where we actually do need to return to a citizen government.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.u">Somehow we&apos;ve gotten used to this idea that you had to be a professional politician in order to run for office. Why? It&apos;s not the way our country was founded. It&apos;s not the way our country operated for much of its history. So why is it that we come to accept, &quot;oh, no, no, no, you have to be a politician all your life to run for political office.&quot; It&apos;s not the way this country was meant to run.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>JZ: If you were to win the nomination, would you therefore not pick as your running mate a professional politician? Would you go for another regular citizen?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.w">CF: Well, I think we have a long time to answer that question.</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>JZ: So Fiorina-Carson is not on the horizon?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.y">CF: I&apos;m making no predictions about what I will do as the nominee. And don&apos;t put words into my mouth!</p><p data-reactid=".9d4zqqayo.1.1.0.0.4.z">[<em>Jason Zengerle](http://www.gq.com/contributor/jason-zengerle) is</em> GQ<em>&apos;s Political
