  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ANighttime on The Bachelor is lit golden by candles: hundreds of them on any given evening, thousands over the course of a season—lit, relit, stoked, oxygenated, basked in, had white wine sipped by the light of—all born of the dry-ice lovemaking fantasy that the show\u0027s producers imagine women dream of.\u000A\u000AThere are thin, upright candles, deprived of their size but not their dignity. There are squat cylinders that do a slovenly morph as they burn, covered in the drips of their own melt. There are tea lights, insignicant on their own but mighty in numbers. On rose ceremony nights, which is when the Bachelor dismisses suitorettes because they\u0027re not Here For The Right Reasons, or because they\u0027ve Kept Their Walls Up, or because they\u0027re not ready to Go On A Journey, the room in which the women await their fate is filled with so many candles that the temperature inside it is different from all the other rooms. On these nights, there is a fire marshal posted on set because it is the law in the case of this much fire. If you removed the roof from the Bachelor house during a rose ceremony, an astronaut would mistake it for a forest fire and call 911.\u000A\u000ARose ceremonies typically tape very late into the night. It\u0027s not easy to get a shot of someone rolling her eyes or looking panicked or annoyed or desperate when she knows she\u0027s on-camera—unless, of course, she\u0027s made to stand on bleachers for hours in very high heels. On this night in early October, Chris Harrison, the host of The Bachelor for all nineteen of its seasons (twenty-nine if you count its Bachelorette spin-off), arrives at the house just as the roses are being laid out and the candles ignited.\u000A\u000AOne of the contestants—they are called \u0022ladies,\u0022 or \u0022girls\u0022—who has straight blonde hair and a short pink taffeta cocktail dress and heels so spiky that they look like a dare, spots Harrison across the patio and locks eyes with him. She has been bouncing a basketball, and now she begins spinning it on her finger, walking past an outdoor couch where two girls stare forlornly, gossip in their narrowed eyes. She chest-passes the ball to Harrison, who, wordlessly, begins to spin the ball on his finger, making me wonder if maybe more people have this skill than I previously imagined. Harrison asks her if she played in college. No, she says, high school. I didn\u0027t catch her name, but her name doesn\u0027t matter at this point—she\u0027s a Sierra or an Amber or a Jessica. And if there\u0027s another Sierra or Amber or Jessica in the cast, then the producers will hitch a last initial to her first name, like they do in my son\u0027s pre-kindergarten class when there are too many Mas. Her name will become apparent if the Bachelor keeps her beyond this week.\u000A\u000ASierra/Amber/Jessica L. hasn\u0027t broken eye contact with Harrison since she\u0027s approached him. She has a lascivious half smile, and suddenly I realize I\u0027m in the middle of something sexual happening. I am late to realizing this, but Harrison is even later.\u000A\u000AI witness a virtual repeat of this one-sided mating dance the very next morning. At 9 A.M., Harrison arrives at the beige Starbucks in the beige Los Angeles suburb where he lives, and the beige yoga moms from his kids\u0027schools in their sun visors and tennis whites come over to him and breathe throaty \u0022Hahhhhyyyyy Chriiiiis\u0022es. He volleys back some shared point of reference: \u0022Will I see Mikey after school?\u0022 \u0022How\u0027s that remodel going?\u0022 \u0022How many miles did you go this morning?\u0022 He does not realize that they are still looking at him, swooning in his wake, long after he has stopped looking at them.\u000A\u000AIn the days that Harrison and I spend together, many, many women will comport themselves around him on a spectrum ranging from gentle flirting to outright assault. Each time I\u0027ll ask him if he\u0027s interested, and each time his eyebrows will pop up and he\u0027ll make a great frown, sincerely surprised at what I\u0027m implying. Her? Yes, her. She was flirting with me? She was. He\u0027ll blow air out of his cheeks, a big Texan hooo-boy, not really understanding how he missed it, then shrug and move on.\u000A\u000AIt is hard to believe that a man whose job is to be a human seismometer of romantic chemistry can be so oblivious, but maybe it\u0027s the sort of thing where the cobbler\u0027s children have no shoes, or doctors can\u0027t operate on themselves.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AChris Harrison, Bachelor host, is now a bachelor himself. He is no longer with the woman he\u0027d been with since he was 18. He and his ex-wife, Gwen, amicably divorced in 2012—is the word \u0022amicable\u0022 ever used in any context but divorce?—and though he has already weathered a couple of seasons as a bachelor on The Bachelor, he\u0027s still feeling his way through all this—through being a divorced father in California. He\u0027s feeling his age, too, which is 43, not in a physical way as much as a symbolic one. He thinks he\u0027s over-the-hill. But 43 is only over-the-hill for certain kinds of people, and Chris Harrison is not one of them.\u000A\u000AHis discomfort with the bachelor life, though, seems to run deeper than age: He\u0027s been feeling lately like he might just be over all of it. Not in a brokenhearted, bitter way—not at all. Harrison is not lonely and he\u0027s not insecure. He\u0027s fine showing up at dinner parties on his own. He\u0027s fine waking up alone, too. Meanwhile, he spends all day at work immersed in a world of constant dress-up and grand romance-making and excitement and optimism and repeated declarations of forever from people who have not yet known the darkness of a divorce—people who seem to want love because of the love-sized hole in their hearts.\u000A\u000AHarrison has no such hole. He has a great life, with golf trips and a wine fridge and a DVR filled with only things he wants to watch. And so if he thinks about it too much, he starts to wonder why he\u0027d ever want any part of this love-and-romance bullshit ever again.\u000A\u000A\u0022Once I got divorced,\u0022 he told me, \u0022there was this knee-jerk reaction to get back in the action and date. I think there\u0027s something wrong in that. I\u0027m incredibly, stunningly happy. What gave me angst was relationships.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis last bit is, of course, blasphemy for anyone who watches The Bachelor—and especially for anyone competing on it. The show debuted in 2002 to pretty universally horrified reviews, all of which begged for its swift death. (The Seattle Post-Intelligencer: \u0022ABC could have saved a ton on limousine fees if it had shrink-wrapped 25 women and placed them in the meat case at Safeway.\u0022) But thirteen years later, The Bachelor is here to stay, and its tropes are now so familiar that a parody show, Burning Love, produced by Ben Stiller and distributed by Hulu, won a 2013 Webby Award for Special Achievement. The presenter at the award ceremony was one Mr. Chris Harrison.\u000A\u000AAt this point, The Bachelor is more than just a hit—it has altered the way our society talks about sex and relationships. And Harrison himself, as the show\u0027s sole constant (aside from the roses and the candles), is the principal agent of that change. The Bachelor is a part of your life, whether you watch it or not. It\u0027s in the water you drink. Maybe you date someone who spends her Monday nights watching the show and you slowly became a sort of willing consumer, poking fun at first, then casually checking the DVR to see if there was a new episode. Or maybe it\u0027s simply that after more than a decade, this show has seeped into the brains of your lady friends, and therefore into yours, messing with your girlfriend\u0027s/wife\u0027s/Tinder hookup\u0027s notion of what romance is, and therefore with yours.\u000A\u000AIt has also helped usher us into the era of purpose-driven dating, where-is-this-going conversations at the first meeting, in-depth deliberations over the changing of a Facebook status, romantic evenings out that do not include Applebee\u0027s. If you\u0027ve considered wearing a fashiony scarf recently, well, you\u0027ve made my case.\u000A\u000AAfter our morning Starbucks run, Harrison and I return to the Bachelor house, where all the contestants bunk. He changes from flip-flops, plaid board shorts, and a gleaming white T-shirt—which matches his gleaming white Range Rover and gleaming white teeth—into jeans and a black linen button-down. He\u0027s come to drop off a \u0022date card,\u0022 a whimsical, punny card in which the current Bachelor has declared who will go on the next date with him.\u000A\u000AA date on The Bachelor is far more extravagant than the best-researched, most Yelp-approved agendas you\u0027ve ever considered—hang gliding, hiking, rappelling, big jumps off small cliffs into azure swimming holes, activities that require hand-holding, that are a metaphor for taking chances, that could make a person feel scared, then safe, then relieved at having survived the challenge of the date. That relief is then quickly and eagerly confused with love, even though you\u0027ve only known this person for a few hours, and even though this person is also dating every single one of your twenty roommates. These dates, when they go well, are marked by amazings: You look amazing tonight and this view is amazing and we\u0027re having the most amazing time. I\u0027ve never felt this way so soon before: You\u0027re amazing.\u000A\u000AI am not the first person to suggest to Harrison that maybe, in light of his divorce, he should be the next Bachelor: He\u0027s handsome, he tests well with audiences, he\u0027s a known commodity, and after thirteen years, a surprise would do the format some good, not to mention the \u0022This time it\u0027s personal\u0022 subplot. Apparently, though, I am the first to suggest that maybe his ex-wife—pretty, sweet, guileless Gwen—should be the next Bachelorette.\u000A\u000A\u0022Now, there\u0027s an idea,\u0022 Harrison says, scratching his chin gamely, looking beyond me. \u0022There\u0027s a part of me, the producer side, that knows it would be epic television, good or bad. It could be like the Hindenburg—the greatest disaster ever—but even then that would be great TV.\u0022 He tells me that if they go with it, I can have a producing credit.\u000A\u000ABut they won\u0027t. He and Gwen know the tropes too well, and they have seen this process too close-up. Plus, no matter how amicable their split was, amicability has its limits, and that limit is guiding your ex toward the Fantasy Suite (bubble bath, candles, condoms, no cameras) with some other dude.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHarrison was born and raised in Dallas. His father and grandfather took him fishing and hunting. He played soccer and golf and watched all the sports, and today he departs from the men with whom he shares the screen by having chest hair and eating egg yolks. He met Gwen at Oklahoma City University. When he saw her that first time across a lawn, he whistled. He\u0027s not the type to whistle at women, and she\u0027s not the type to wander over to a guy who whistles, but he did and she did, and so she became his first and last serious girlfriend. They married immediately after graduation. She was an accountant. He was a sportscaster.\u000A\u000ANine years later he got the Bachelor gig. At first, his only job was to be the gleaming-toothed sparkleface who would come on-camera and introduce people, check in on their mental health, remind them when there was only one rose left, that sort of thing. But he\u0027s grown into a much bigger role: It\u0027s part of his job now to discover future Bachelor/ettes, to juggle all the warring personalities, to be simultaneously the show\u0027s bullshit-caller and its face of continuity and warmth.\u000A\u000ALater, when Chris and I meet up with Gwen for salad—amicable, amicable—she tells me that he was born knowing exactly what to say and how to say it. I can\u0027t attest to how far back this skill of his stretches, but I can confirm that he\u0027s still got it. Chris Harrison is one of the smoothest motherfuckers I\u0027ve ever met. On-screen he is able to do something that I believe men are generally not wired for: He can sit there and listen to a woman, allow her to emote and cry, and never interrupt, never try to shut her down or clean her up. Sure, it\u0027s good television to let the tears flow, but still, it\u0027s rare to find a man who can allow himself to allow it. When it\u0027s time to ask a contestant to leave, his face is the face you want: lips mashed mournfully together, eyebrows up, big sigh.\u000A\u000AEven off-camera, he speaks in crisp sentences. He doesn\u0027t stumble. He doesn\u0027t stammer. You should see my interview transcript; it came back from the transcriber as if it had already been edited. Gwen says Harrison is just as he appears on TV, \u0022but funnier. People don\u0027t realize how funny he is.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAnd yet something between them went wrong, despite this amicable salad, or this salad of amicability. People want it to be something dramatic—an affair with a Bachelorette, say, which was briefly a rumor—but the end of the Harrisons was pretty mundane: They married young, they never learned to communicate. It turns out you can be a great talker and still not know how to talk to your spouse.\u000A\u000A\u0022As we started to grow apart and hit hard times, we just weren\u0027t equipped to handle it, unfortunately,\u0022 he says.\u0022We\u0027ve always been great friends, and in the end that\u0027s helped us remain\u0022—ten bucks if you can guess the word he uses next—\u0022amicable.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe has been dating. At first he played around some, \u0022but that got old fast. I would love to say I\u0027m that guy who sleeps around, but I\u0027m just not. That\u0027s not my thing. I tried. I\u0027m not good at it. It\u0027s exhausting.\u0022 That last sentence might be closest to the truth. Because what is monogamy, really, but the halting of the musical chairs at the moment when sleeping around becomes more aggravation than it\u0027s worth?\u000A\u000AAll these years later, Harrison has come out on the other side of 40 to find himself still good-looking, still in great shape, with a high profile and a firepit on his patio. But he often feels like an unfrozen caveman. He offers to pick up dates at their homes, and they ask if they could just meet him at the restaurant. When he mentions this to the show\u0027s younger producers, they look at him with pity: Yes, Chris, you meet your dates at the place now. He is amazed by the amount of texting required before you actually meet someone. Sometimes it\u0027s so rampant that he just hits \u0022voice call,\u0022 and then he\u0027s confused when they don\u0027t answer. (\u0022I know you\u0027re there,\u0022 he doesn\u0027t say on the voice mail he doesn\u0027t leave. \u0022We were just texting.\u0022) Now he\u0027s really selective about whom he dates. More than once during our time together, he muses aloud about quitting dating altogether.\u000A\u000ABut then, on the show, he transforms back into America\u0027s foremost love doctor. He sits across from the Bachelor/ettes—far brighter-eyed than he is, far more optimistic, basically children—and he asks them the pertinent questions: How is it going? Have you found the one yet? Are you falling in love?\u000A\u000AHarrison knows that they will speak the truth in these moments, that even though his own life is in flux, he is still their leader, their guide through this Journey, and that right now everything feels very real and very sacred: It\u0027s going great. I have found the one. I\u0027m falling in love. Yes, there are three of them.\u000A\u000A\u0022Love,\u0022 he told me at one point, \u0022is as much of a competition as anything. If you don\u0027t think so, you\u0027re either losing the game or you\u0027re not playing.\u0022 He may have been talking about the show, or maybe he wasn\u0027t.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThis season\u0027s new bachelor, Farmer Chris, is an actual farmer, and he was rejected by last season\u0027s Bachelorette, Andi, because—hunk though he is—she couldn\u0027t see herself living on an actual farm in the middle of the country. She couldn\u0027t even bring herself to invite him into the Fantasy Suite because what if the gauzy, humid dream that unfolds in there (sex) somehow led to life on a farm? She couldn\u0027t chance it, plus her parents were watching.\u000A\u000AIf I could, I\u0027d create a new first Greek letter for Andi Dorfman, because \u0022alpha\u0022 is reserved for people who would merely eat their young to get ahead. She had taken a leave from her job as an assistant district attorney in Atlanta to come find love on this show. Now her prosecutorial training comes in handy. On dates, she demands answers from these guys: What happened with your last relationship? Why won\u0027t you open up to me? Are you really serious about this process, because I am! At one point, she actually puts them all through a lie-detector test, and I\u0027m not euphemizing: They were strapped to a machine. (Technically the producers choose the dates, but they align them with her general Andi-ness.) At another point, a contender tells her that she seems fake, and could he maybe see the real side of her. He does it in a nice way, but she nearly has an aneurysm. That man later dies (no shit, he dies for real, look it up) but only after Andi has booted him. You don\u0027t call Andi anything but amazing.\u000A\u000AThis is what dating is really like, Harrison tells me. And I agree with him: In every relationship, if we\u0027re being honest, one person has all the power.\u000A\u000AAndi took her contenders on a group date to Marseille, them dragging their feet, knowing it meant she didn\u0027t feel particularly smitten with any one of them, and while there she made them take a mime workshop. You heard me right: dressed them up in striped shirts and suspenders and white gloves and made them perform in a square. Mimes. People who aren\u0027t allowed to talk. There may be no more perfect metaphor for what it must be like to be on a date with Andi. But that\u0027s the megalomania of being the Bachelor/ette. Imagine a situation in which you can say anything you want to the person you are dating, with no consequences. Imagine how drunk that power would make you, and how quickly. During another episode Andi made them strip, as in do a stripper\u0027s routine at a strip club, just in case you were concerned the emasculation was too subtle to register.\u000A\u000AIf the Bachelor franchise has had one major influence on American culture, says Harrison, it\u0027s that it has created a space in which men and women could have an honest conversation about relationships, including their own. They watch the show together and allow the behavior on-screen to become a subject in their own relationship. \u0022It\u0027s a passive-aggressive way to really talk about your own feelings of, like, \u0027I really don\u0027t like what he\u0027s doing\u0027 or \u0027I really like the way he does that.\u0027 That\u0027s what this show does,\u0022 Harrison asserts. \u0022It literally just gives everyone a chance to sit around and talk.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe Bachelorette was added to the rotation twelve years ago, right at the moment that the franchise had shed its novelty and evolved into the thing that all reality shows eventually become: a sport. A cutthroat game to be played and won—perhaps less overtly so than, say, Survivor, but no different at its core. At first, the men on The Bachelorette were pretty standard bros: beer bongs and lawn vomit and pranks involving dog food. Those guys wouldn\u0027t recognize Andi\u0027s pool of suitors now—the ex-athletes and gym teachers and \u0022social-media marketers\u0022 whose only vestiges of bro-dom are the inspirational sports metaphors they use: They\u0027re down to the wire, giving 110 percent, it\u0027s time for a Hail Mary pass, it\u0027s theirs to lose…\u000A\u000ANow, I should leave room for the possibility that this is a self-selecting process—that a bunch of men who choose to live together and date the same woman might be a specific breed. But I contend that the show\u0027s massive influence has unlocked the beta (and gamma and delta) lurking inside the modern American alpha male and inspired it to flourish. This is a show where a woman enters a candlelit foyer in an evening gown and announces that she just knows her husband is in here. And instead of bolting for the door, these men stay and clink white-wine glasses and play at friendship, only to acknowledge way too late that they\u0027re in competition for—and in some cases actually boning—the same woman. They often talk about trying to \u0022keep the house drama-free,\u0022 and they cannot contain their contempt for a smug software salesman named Nick, who is forced to endure lectures about \u0022how a gentleman behaves\u0022 from other gentlemen in the house. \u0022Every season there\u0027s someone who rubs everyone else the wrong way,\u0022 says Harrison. But no one asked Nick to step outside. Instead, they gossiped about him like hens, sitting around in their pretty scarves and waiting to be plucked by Andi.\u000A\u000A\u0022Maybe,\u0022 Harrison says, \u0022we\u0027ve created a better man.\u0022\u000A\u000AOne thing I admire about him is that he means this sincerely. Through his shirt I can see his chest hair. It is the only chest hair for miles. \u0022I don\u0027t know if we can take full credit,\u0022 he says, \u0022but I do think we have helped evolve the modern man, to teach him how a woman wants to be treated. I think we have helped men and women kind of get to know each other and break down that wall where we never used to communicate. Things that needed to be said and no one ever really wanted to talk about. Guys want to talk about feelings, too, sometimes. Guys want to be reassured, too—even the manliest of men.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis may be true, but to my mind it\u0027s only Harrison who exists in the shared part of the manly/sensitive/scarf-wearing Venn diagram of male desirability. Because if this really is evolution, if this really is what women want, then why did I turn off every episode disappointed that no one had yelled, no one had punched, no one had shut down and gone stoic. I mean, maybe this is progress; I\u0027m all for a gender-neutral society. But it\u0027s telling to me that around the time I started watching The Bachelor, I also started watching Ultimate Fighting.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAt the end of each season, ABC airs a live reunion in Los Angeles at which a guest audience of women with Disney-princess hair and matching teen daughters watches the Bachelor/ette finale. Afterward, Harrison interviews the rejected runner-up and the happy new couple. Last summer, just before Farmer Chris was announced as the new Bachelor, we gathered in a very cold studio to watch Andi\u0027s Bachelorette season end.\u000A\u000AIn the front row were ghosts of Bachelor past: glitter makeup and hair extensions and Spanx for all the women, suits for the men. Some of the discarded guys from Andi\u0027s season were here, including Farmer Chris, and so were a few rejected women of yore, including Clare, an incoherent runner-up, notable for almost certainly having sex in the ocean with her Bachelor, in a little part of the South China Sea that I\u0027ll christen the Venereal Reef.\u000A\u000AAndi\u0027s season had come down to Josh, a \u0022former pro baseball player\u0022 with a game-show smile, and Nick, that software guy no one liked. Both were handsome in different ways, both completely devoid of body hair. I conjecture that Andi knew early on she\u0027d end up with Josh, but it\u0027s a TV show and you can\u0027t end it early, so you have to string at least one guy along.\u000A\u000AWeeks after he\u0027d been rejected on the show, Nick was still dizzy with confusion. He\u0027d thought he and Andi were a lock—that they were just waiting out this silly reality-show construct so they could be together. Ever since the finale had taped, he\u0027d been trying to get in touch with Andi, and she had refused, so now he was here to do it in person, and you\u0027d have to be a terrible producer to turn down that kind of TV.\u000A\u000AHarrison, warm and reassuring, welcomed him to the stage and listened as Nick explained that he just wanted some closure. During the commercial break, Nick half-waved to the guys in the front row. They fake-smiled at him and smirked to one another, a page right out of the playbook from my all-girls high school. Nick was so nervous he spilled his bottle of water. That\u0027s when Harrison leaned in to talk to him, something the audience couldn\u0027t hear. And maybe in that moment he took poor Nick, water at his feet as though he\u0027d cried a thousand tears, and said, Hey there, Nick. This is hard work, this showing up and confronting and asking for what you believe is yours, but we are men, and we must hold our heads up high and move on. Look at me, look at all I\u0027ve been through, and look at how I can still be here and smile and cheer for love. Look at me, learning to text and not to open doors. You will find a lady/girl of your own one day, or maybe you won\u0027t, and maybe I will, and maybe I won\u0027t, but we still have to hold it together. We still have to find our final amazing.\u000A\u000AA production assistant cleaned up the water.\u000A\u000ASoon Andi came onstage and sat tensely next to Nick, who actually asked her how she could have \u0022made love\u0022 with him if she didn\u0027t love him. She was contemptuous and disgusted by this, by this guy who still seemed under the impression that it had all been a misunderstanding. And maybe nobody liked Nick because his grief was too real. Maybe nobody liked Nick because he reminded us that love and need and vulnerability are so, so ugly when a relationship doesn\u0027t work out. During the next commercial break, Andi turned toward the guys she\u0027d rejected in the front row to share an eye roll with them at Nick\u0027s expense. But at this they stiffened. Suddenly they realized that they had more in common with Nick than with her, that it was only by the grace of God that they weren\u0027t up there, humiliated, with wet shoes. Suddenly they realized that this wasn\u0027t so much a contest as it was a game, and that they\u0027d all lost, even Josh, all of them except for Andi.\u000A\u000AApplause swelled. The credits rolled. Harrison smiled and greeted all the women in the audience, either not noticing or not acknowledging their pre-approach bra hoists and Binaca squirts. Who could figure out love, anyway? Not a bunch of guys who eat egg whites and protein shakes and live together and date the same girl. Not the millions of women watching them. Maybe not even Chris Harrison, who, to me, feels like the only man left in all of California: his chest full of hair, his omelets full of yolk, his heart full of loss and fortitude.\u000A\u000ATAFFY BRODESSER-AKNER  (@taffyakner) is a GQ correspondent.",

There are squat cylinders that do a slovenly morph as they burn, covered in the drips of their own melt. There are tea lights, insignicant on their own but mighty in numbers. On rose ceremony nights, which is when the Bachelor dismisses suitorettes because they&#x2019;re not Here For The Right Reasons, or because they&#x2019;ve Kept Their Walls Up, or because they&#x2019;re not ready to Go On A Journey, the room in which the women await their fate is filled with so many candles that the temperature inside it is different from all the other rooms. On these nights, <em>there is a fire marshal posted on set</em> because <em>it is the law</em> in the case of <em>this much fire</em>. If you removed the roof from the <em>Bachelor</em> house during a rose ceremony, an astronaut would mistake it for a forest fire and call 911.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.3">Rose ceremonies typically tape very late into the night. It&#x2019;s not easy to get a shot of someone rolling her eyes or looking panicked or annoyed or desperate when she knows she&#x2019;s on-camera&#x2014;unless, of course, she&#x2019;s made to stand on bleachers for hours in very high heels. On this night in early October, Chris Harrison, the host of <em>The Bachelor</em> for all nineteen of its seasons (twenty-nine if you count its <em>Bachelorette</em> spin-off), arrives at the house just as the roses are being laid out and the candles ignited.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.5">One of the contestants&#x2014;they are called &quot;ladies,&quot; or &quot;girls&quot;&#x2014;who has straight blonde hair and a short pink taffeta cocktail dress and heels so spiky that they look like a dare, spots Harrison across the patio and locks eyes with him. She has been bouncing a basketball, and now she begins spinning it on her finger, walking past an outdoor couch where two girls stare forlornly, gossip in their narrowed eyes. She chest-passes the ball to Harrison, who, wordlessly, begins to spin the ball on <em>his</em> finger, making me wonder if maybe more people have this skill than I previously imagined. Harrison asks her if she played in college. No, she says, high school. I didn&#x2019;t catch her name, but her name doesn&#x2019;t matter at this point&#x2014;she&#x2019;s a Sierra or an Amber or a Jessica. And if there&#x2019;s another Sierra or Amber or Jessica in the cast, then the producers will hitch a last initial to her first name, like they do in my son&#x2019;s pre-kindergarten class when there are too many Mas. Her name will become apparent if the Bachelor keeps her beyond this week.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.6">Sierra/Amber/Jessica L. hasn&#x2019;t broken eye contact with Harrison since she&#x2019;s approached him. She has a lascivious half smile, and suddenly I realize I&#x2019;m in the middle of something sexual happening. I am late to realizing this, but Harrison is even later.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.7">I witness a virtual repeat of this one-sided mating dance the very next morning. At 9 A.M., Harrison arrives at the beige Starbucks in the beige Los Angeles suburb where he lives, and the beige yoga moms from his kids&#x2019;schools in their sun visors and tennis whites come over to him and breathe throaty &quot;Hahhhhyyyyy Chriiiiis&quot;es. He volleys back some shared point of reference: &quot;Will I see Mikey after school?&quot; &quot;How&#x2019;s that remodel going?&quot; &quot;How many miles did you go <em>this</em> morning?&quot; He does not realize that they are still looking at him, swooning in his wake, long after he has stopped looking at them.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.8">In the days that Harrison and I spend together, many, many women will comport themselves around him on a spectrum ranging from gentle flirting to outright assault. Each time I&#x2019;ll ask him if he&#x2019;s interested, and each time his eyebrows will pop up and he&#x2019;ll make a great frown, sincerely surprised at what I&#x2019;m implying. <em>Her?</em> Yes, her. <em>She was flirting with me?</em> She was. He&#x2019;ll blow air out of his cheeks, a big Texan <em>hooo-boy,</em> not really understanding how he missed it, then shrug and move on.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.9">It is hard to believe that a man whose job is to be a human seismometer of romantic chemistry can be so oblivious, but maybe it&#x2019;s the sort of thing where the cobbler&#x2019;s children have no shoes, or doctors can&#x2019;t operate on themselves.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.a"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c931e52bc4b477a9d7f8/master/w_806/entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-02.jpg" alt="entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fchris-harrison-bachelor&amp;t=entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fchris-harrison-bachelor&amp;t=entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fchris-harrison-bachelor&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c931e52bc4b477a9d7f8%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fchris-harrison-bachelor&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c931e52bc4b477a9d7f8%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.b"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.c">Chris Harrison, <em>Bachelor</em> host, is now a bachelor himself. He is no longer with the woman he&#x2019;d been with since he was 18. He and his ex-wife, Gwen, amicably divorced in 2012&#x2014;is the word &quot;amicable&quot; ever used in any context <em>but</em> divorce?&#x2014;and though he has already weathered a couple of seasons as a bachelor on <em>The Bachelor,</em> he&#x2019;s still feeling his way through all this&#x2014;through being a divorced father in California. He&#x2019;s feeling his age, too, which is 43, not in a physical way as much as a symbolic one. He thinks he&#x2019;s over-the-hill. But 43 is only over-the-hill for certain kinds of people, and Chris Harrison is not one of them.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.d">His discomfort with the bachelor life, though, seems to run deeper than age: He&#x2019;s been feeling lately like he might just be over all of it. Not in a brokenhearted, bitter way&#x2014;not at all. Harrison is not lonely and he&#x2019;s not insecure. He&#x2019;s fine showing up at dinner parties on his own. He&#x2019;s fine waking up alone, too. Meanwhile, he spends all day at work immersed in a world of constant dress-up and grand romance-making and excitement and optimism and repeated declarations of forever from people who have not yet known the darkness of a divorce&#x2014;people who seem to want love because of the love-sized hole in their hearts.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.e">Harrison has no such hole. He has a great life, with golf trips and a wine fridge and a DVR filled with only things he wants to watch. And so if he thinks about it too much, he starts to wonder why he&#x2019;d ever want any part of this love-and-romance bullshit ever again.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.f">&quot;Once I got divorced,&quot; he told me, &quot;there was this knee-jerk reaction to get back in the action and date. I think there&#x2019;s something wrong in that. I&#x2019;m incredibly, stunningly happy. What gave me angst was <em>relationships.</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.g">This last bit is, of course, blasphemy for anyone who watches <em>The Bachelor</em>&#x2014;and especially for anyone competing on it. The show debuted in 2002 to pretty universally horrified reviews, all of which begged for its swift death. (The <em>Seattle Post-Intelligencer:</em> &quot;ABC could have saved a ton on limousine fees if it had shrink-wrapped 25 women and placed them in the meat case at Safeway.&quot;) But thirteen years later, <em>The Bachelor</em> is here to stay, and its tropes are now so familiar that a parody show, <em>Burning Love,</em> produced by Ben Stiller and distributed by Hulu, won a 2013 Webby Award for Special Achievement. The presenter at the award ceremony was one Mr. Chris Harrison.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.h">At this point, <em>The Bachelor</em> is more than just a hit&#x2014;it has altered the way our society talks about sex and relationships. And Harrison himself, as the show&#x2019;s sole constant (aside from the roses and the candles), is the principal agent of that change. <em>The Bachelor</em> is a part of your life, whether you watch it or not. It&#x2019;s in the water you drink. Maybe you date someone who spends her Monday nights watching the show and you slowly became a sort of willing consumer, poking fun at first, then casually checking the DVR to see if there was a new episode. Or maybe it&#x2019;s simply that after more than a decade, this show has seeped into the brains of your lady friends, and therefore into yours, messing with your girlfriend&#x2019;s/wife&#x2019;s/Tinder hookup&#x2019;s notion of what romance is, and therefore with yours.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.i">It has also helped usher us into the era of purpose-driven dating, where-is-this-going conversations at the first meeting, in-depth deliberations over the changing of a Facebook status, romantic evenings out that do not include Applebee&#x2019;s. If you&#x2019;ve considered wearing a fashiony scarf recently, well, you&#x2019;ve made my case.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.j">After our morning Starbucks run, Harrison and I return to the <em>Bachelor</em> house, where all the contestants bunk. He changes from flip-flops, plaid board shorts, and a gleaming white T-shirt&#x2014;which matches his gleaming white Range Rover and gleaming white teeth&#x2014;into jeans and a black linen button-down. He&#x2019;s come to drop off a &quot;date card,&quot; a whimsical, punny card in which the current Bachelor has declared who will go on the next date with him.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.k">A date on <em>The Bachelor</em> is far more extravagant than the best-researched, most Yelp-approved agendas you&#x2019;ve ever considered&#x2014;hang gliding, hiking, rappelling, big jumps off small cliffs into azure swimming holes, activities that require hand-holding, that are a metaphor for taking chances, that could make a person feel scared, then safe, then relieved at having survived the challenge of the date. That relief is then quickly and eagerly confused with love, even though you&#x2019;ve only known this person for a few hours, and even though this person is also dating every single one of your twenty roommates. These dates, when they go well, are marked by amazings: You look amazing tonight and this view is amazing and we&#x2019;re having the most amazing time. I&#x2019;ve never felt this way so soon before: You&#x2019;re amazing.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.l">I am not the first person to suggest to Harrison that maybe, in light of his divorce, he should be the next Bachelor: He&#x2019;s handsome, he tests well with audiences, he&#x2019;s a known commodity, and after thirteen years, a surprise would do the format some good, not to mention the &quot;This time it&#x2019;s personal&quot; subplot. Apparently, though, I am the first to suggest that maybe his ex-wife&#x2014;pretty, sweet, guileless Gwen&#x2014;should be the next Bachelorette.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.m">&quot;Now, <em>there&#x2019;s</em> an idea,&quot; Harrison says, scratching his chin gamely, looking beyond me. &quot;There&#x2019;s a part of me, the producer side, that knows it would be epic television, good or bad. It could be like the <em>Hindenburg</em>&#x2014;the greatest disaster ever&#x2014;but even then that would be great TV.&quot; He tells me that if they go with it, I can have a producing credit.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.n">But they won&#x2019;t. He and Gwen know the tropes too well, and they have seen this process too close-up. Plus, no matter how amicable their split was, amicability has its limits, and that limit is guiding your ex toward the Fantasy Suite (bubble bath, candles, condoms, no cameras) with some other dude.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.o"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.p">Harrison was born and raised in Dallas. His father and grandfather took him fishing and hunting. He played soccer and golf and watched all the sports, and today he departs from the men with whom he shares the screen by having chest hair and eating egg yolks. He met Gwen at Oklahoma City University. When he saw her that first time across a lawn, he whistled. He&#x2019;s not the type to whistle at women, and she&#x2019;s not the type to wander over to a guy who whistles, but he did and she did, and so she became his first and last serious girlfriend. They married immediately after graduation. She was an accountant. He was a sportscaster.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.q">Nine years later he got the <em>Bachelor</em> gig. At first, his only job was to be the gleaming-toothed sparkleface who would come on-camera and introduce people, check in on their mental health, remind them when there was only one rose left, that sort of thing. But he&#x2019;s grown into a much bigger role: It&#x2019;s part of his job now to discover future Bachelor/ettes, to juggle all the warring personalities, to be simultaneously the show&#x2019;s bullshit-caller and its face of continuity and warmth.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.r">Later, when Chris and I meet up with Gwen for salad&#x2014;amicable, amicable&#x2014;she tells me that he was born knowing exactly what to say and how to say it. I can&#x2019;t attest to how far back this skill of his stretches, but I can confirm that he&#x2019;s still got it. Chris Harrison is one of the smoothest motherfuckers I&#x2019;ve ever met. On-screen he is able to do something that I believe men are generally not wired for: He can sit there and <em>listen</em> to a woman, allow her to emote and cry, and never interrupt, never try to shut her down or clean her up. Sure, it&#x2019;s good television to let the tears flow, but still, it&#x2019;s rare to find a man who can allow himself to allow it. When it&#x2019;s time to ask a contestant to leave, his face is the face you want: lips mashed mournfully together, eyebrows up, big sigh.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.s">Even off-camera, he speaks in crisp sentences. He doesn&#x2019;t stumble. He doesn&#x2019;t stammer. You should see my interview transcript; it came back from the transcriber as if it had already been edited. Gwen says Harrison is just as he appears on TV, &quot;but funnier. People don&#x2019;t realize how funny he is.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.t"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c9321177d66d68d58955/master/w_806/entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-03.jpg" alt="entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fchris-harrison-bachelor&amp;t=entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fchris-harrison-bachelor&amp;t=entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fchris-harrison-bachelor&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9321177d66d68d58955%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-03.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fchris-harrison-bachelor&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9321177d66d68d58955%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-03.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-01-chris-harrison-chris-harrison-gq-magazine-january-2015-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.u">And yet something between them went wrong, despite this amicable salad, or this salad of amicability. People want it to be something dramatic&#x2014;an affair with a Bachelorette, say, which was briefly a rumor&#x2014;but the end of the Harrisons was pretty mundane: They married young, they never learned to communicate. It turns out you can be a great talker and still not know how to talk to your spouse.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.v">&quot;As we started to grow apart and hit hard times, we just weren&#x2019;t equipped to handle it, unfortunately,&quot; he says.&quot;We&#x2019;ve always been great friends, and in the end that&#x2019;s helped us remain&quot;&#x2014;ten bucks if you can guess the word he uses next&#x2014;&quot;amicable.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.w">He has been dating. At first he played around some, &quot;but that got old fast. I would love to say I&#x2019;m that guy who sleeps around, but I&#x2019;m just not. That&#x2019;s not my thing. I tried. I&#x2019;m not good at it. It&#x2019;s exhausting.&quot; That last sentence might be closest to the truth. Because what is monogamy, really, but the halting of the musical chairs at the moment when sleeping around becomes more aggravation than it&#x2019;s worth?</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.x">All these years later, Harrison has come out on the other side of 40 to find himself still good-looking, still in great shape, with a high profile and a firepit on his patio. But he often feels like an unfrozen caveman. He offers to pick up dates at their homes, and they ask if they could just meet him at the restaurant. When he mentions this to the show&#x2019;s younger producers, they look at him with pity: <em>Yes, Chris, you meet your dates at the place now.</em> He is amazed by the amount of texting required before you actually meet someone. Sometimes it&#x2019;s so rampant that he just hits &quot;voice call,&quot; and then he&#x2019;s confused when they don&#x2019;t answer. (&quot;I know you&#x2019;re there,&quot; he doesn&#x2019;t say on the voice mail he doesn&#x2019;t leave. &quot;We were just texting.&quot;) Now he&#x2019;s really selective about whom he dates. More than once during our time together, he muses aloud about quitting dating altogether.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.y">But then, on the show, he transforms back into America&#x2019;s foremost love doctor. He sits across from the Bachelor/ettes&#x2014;far brighter-eyed than he is, far more optimistic, basically children&#x2014;and he asks them the pertinent questions: <em>How is it going? Have you found the one yet? Are you falling in love?</em></p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.z">Harrison knows that they will speak the truth in these moments, that even though his own life is in flux, he is still their leader, their guide through this Journey, and that right now everything feels very real and very sacred: <em>It&#x2019;s going great. I have found the one. I&#x2019;m falling in love. Yes, there are three of them.</em></p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.10">&quot;Love,&quot; he told me at one point, &quot;is as much of a competition as anything. If you don&#x2019;t think so, you&#x2019;re either losing the game or you&#x2019;re not playing.&quot; He may have been talking about the show, or maybe he wasn&#x2019;t.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.11"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.12">This season&#x2019;s new bachelor, Farmer Chris, is an actual farmer, and he was rejected by last season&#x2019;s Bachelorette, Andi, because&#x2014;hunk though he is&#x2014;she couldn&#x2019;t see herself living on an actual farm in the middle of the country. She couldn&#x2019;t even bring herself to invite him into the Fantasy Suite because what if the gauzy, humid dream that unfolds in there (sex) somehow <em>led</em> to life on a farm? She couldn&#x2019;t chance it, plus her parents were watching.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.13">If I could, I&#x2019;d create a new first Greek letter for Andi Dorfman, because &quot;alpha&quot; is reserved for people who would merely eat their young to get ahead. She had taken a leave from her job as an assistant district attorney in Atlanta to come find love on this show. Now her prosecutorial training comes in handy. On dates, she demands answers from these guys: <em>What happened with your last relationship? Why won&#x2019;t you open up to me? Are you really serious about this process, because I am!</em> At one point, she actually puts them all through a lie-detector test, and I&#x2019;m not euphemizing: They were strapped to a machine. (Technically the producers choose the dates, but they align them with her general Andi-ness.) At another point, a contender tells her that she seems fake, and could he maybe see the real side of her. He does it in a nice way, but she nearly has an aneurysm. That man later dies (no shit, he dies for real, look it up) but only after Andi has booted him. You don&#x2019;t call Andi anything but amazing.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.14">This is what dating is really like, Harrison tells me. And I agree with him: In every relationship, if we&#x2019;re being honest, one person has all the power.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.15">Andi took her contenders on a group date to Marseille, them dragging their feet, knowing it meant she didn&#x2019;t feel particularly smitten with any one of them, and while there she made them take a mime workshop. You heard me right: dressed them up in striped shirts and suspenders and white gloves and made them perform in a square. <em>Mimes.</em> People who aren&#x2019;t allowed to talk. There may be no more perfect metaphor for what it must be like to be on a date with Andi. But that&#x2019;s the megalomania of being the Bachelor/ette. Imagine a situation in which you can say anything you want to the person you are dating, with no consequences. Imagine how drunk that power would make you, and how quickly. During another episode Andi made them strip, as in do a stripper&#x2019;s routine at a strip club, just in case you were concerned the emasculation was too subtle to register.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.16">If the <em>Bachelor</em> franchise has had one major influence on American culture, says Harrison, it&#x2019;s that it has created a space in which men and women could have an honest conversation about relationships, including their own. They watch the show together and allow the behavior on-screen to become a subject in their own relationship. &quot;It&#x2019;s a passive-aggressive way to really talk about your own feelings of, like, &#x2019;I really don&#x2019;t like what he&#x2019;s doing&#x2019; or &#x2019;I really like the way he does that.&#x2019; That&#x2019;s what this show does,&quot; Harrison asserts. &quot;It literally just gives everyone a chance to sit around and talk.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.17"><em>The Bachelorette</em> was added to the rotation twelve years ago, right at the moment that the franchise had shed its novelty and evolved into the thing that all reality shows eventually become: a sport. A cutthroat game to be played and won&#x2014;perhaps less overtly so than, say, <em>Survivor,</em> but no different at its core. At first, the men on <em>The Bachelorette</em> were pretty standard bros: beer bongs and lawn vomit and pranks involving dog food. Those guys wouldn&#x2019;t recognize Andi&#x2019;s pool of suitors now&#x2014;the ex-athletes and gym teachers and &quot;social-media marketers&quot; whose only vestiges of bro-dom are the inspirational sports metaphors they use: They&#x2019;re down to the wire, giving 110 percent, it&#x2019;s time for a Hail Mary pass, it&#x2019;s theirs to lose&#x2026;</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.18">Now, I should leave room for the possibility that this is a self-selecting process&#x2014;that a bunch of men who choose to live together and date the same woman might be a specific breed. But I contend that the show&#x2019;s massive influence has unlocked the beta (and gamma and delta) lurking inside the modern American alpha male and inspired it to flourish. This is a show where a woman enters a candlelit foyer in an evening gown and announces that she just <em>knows</em> her husband is in here. And instead of bolting for the door, these men stay and clink white-wine glasses and play at friendship, only to acknowledge way too late that they&#x2019;re in competition for&#x2014;and in some cases actually boning&#x2014;the same woman. They often talk about trying to &quot;keep the house drama-free,&quot; and they cannot contain their contempt for a smug software salesman named Nick, who is forced to endure lectures about &quot;how a gentleman behaves&quot; from other gentlemen in the house. &quot;Every season there&#x2019;s someone who rubs everyone else the wrong way,&quot; says Harrison. But no one asked Nick to step outside. Instead, they gossiped about him like hens, sitting around in their pretty scarves and waiting to be plucked by Andi.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.19">&quot;Maybe,&quot; Harrison says, &quot;we&#x2019;ve created a better man.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.1a">One thing I admire about him is that he means this sincerely. Through his shirt I can see his chest hair. It is the only chest hair for miles. &quot;I don&#x2019;t know if we can take full credit,&quot; he says, &quot;but I do think we have helped evolve the modern man, to teach him how a woman wants to be treated. I think we have helped men and women kind of get to know each other and break down that wall where we never used to communicate. Things that needed to be said and no one ever really wanted to talk about. Guys want to talk about feelings, too, sometimes. Guys want to be reassured, too&#x2014;even the manliest of men.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.1b">This may be true, but to my mind it&#x2019;s only Harrison who exists in the shared part of the manly/sensitive/scarf-wearing Venn diagram of male desirability. Because if this really is evolution, if this really is what women want, then why did I turn off every episode disappointed that no one had yelled, no one had punched, no one had shut down and gone stoic. I mean, maybe this is progress; I&#x2019;m all for a gender-neutral society. But it&#x2019;s telling to me that around the time I started watching <em>The Bachelor,</em> I also started watching Ultimate Fighting.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.1d">At the end of each season, ABC airs a live reunion in Los Angeles at which a guest audience of women with Disney-princess hair and matching teen daughters watches the <em>Bachelor/ette</em> finale. Afterward, Harrison interviews the rejected runner-up and the happy new couple. Last summer, just before Farmer Chris was announced as the new Bachelor, we gathered in a very cold studio to watch Andi&#x2019;s <em>Bachelorette</em> season end.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.1e">In the front row were ghosts of <em>Bachelor</em> past: glitter makeup and hair extensions and Spanx for all the women, suits for the men. Some of the discarded guys from Andi&#x2019;s season were here, including Farmer Chris, and so were a few rejected women of yore, including Clare, an incoherent runner-up, notable for almost certainly having sex in the ocean with her Bachelor, in a little part of the South China Sea that I&#x2019;ll christen the Venereal Reef.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.1f">Andi&#x2019;s season had come down to Josh, a &quot;former pro baseball player&quot; with a game-show smile, and Nick, that software guy no one liked. Both were handsome in different ways, both completely devoid of body hair. I conjecture that Andi knew early on she&#x2019;d end up with Josh, but it&#x2019;s a TV show and you can&#x2019;t end it early, so you have to string at least one guy along.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.1g">Weeks after he&#x2019;d been rejected on the show, Nick was still dizzy with confusion. He&#x2019;d thought he and Andi were a lock&#x2014;that they were just waiting out this silly reality-show construct so they could be together. Ever since the finale had taped, he&#x2019;d been trying to get in touch with Andi, and she had refused, so now he was here to do it in person, and you&#x2019;d have to be a terrible producer to turn down that kind of TV.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.1h">Harrison, warm and reassuring, welcomed him to the stage and listened as Nick explained that he just wanted some closure. During the commercial break, Nick half-waved to the guys in the front row. They fake-smiled at him and smirked to one another, a page right out of the playbook from my all-girls high school. Nick was so nervous he spilled his bottle of water. That&#x2019;s when Harrison leaned in to talk to him, something the audience couldn&#x2019;t hear. And maybe in that moment he took poor Nick, water at his feet as though he&#x2019;d cried a thousand tears, and said, <em>Hey there, Nick. This is hard work, this showing up and confronting and asking for what you believe is yours, but we are men, and we must hold our heads up high and move on. Look at me, look at all I&#x2019;ve been through, and look at how I can still be here and smile and cheer for love. Look at me, learning to text and not to open doors. You will find a lady/girl of your own one day, or maybe you won&#x2019;t, and maybe I will, and maybe I won&#x2019;t, but we still have to hold it together. We still have to find our final amazing.</em></p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.1i">A production assistant cleaned up the water.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.1j">Soon Andi came onstage and sat tensely next to Nick, who actually asked her how she could have &quot;made love&quot; with him if she didn&#x2019;t love him. She was contemptuous and disgusted by this, by this guy who still seemed under the impression that it had all been a misunderstanding. And maybe nobody liked Nick because his grief was too real. Maybe nobody liked Nick because he reminded us that love and need and vulnerability are so, so ugly when a relationship doesn&#x2019;t work out. During the next commercial break, Andi turned toward the guys she&#x2019;d rejected in the front row to share an eye roll with them at Nick&#x2019;s expense. But at this they stiffened. Suddenly they realized that they had more in common with Nick than with her, that it was only by the grace of God that they weren&#x2019;t up there, humiliated, with wet shoes. Suddenly they realized that this wasn&#x2019;t so much a contest as it was a game, and that they&#x2019;d all lost, even Josh, all of them except for Andi.</p><p data-reactid=".195ci8se8sg.1.1.0.0.4.1k">Applause swelled. The credits rolled. Harrison smiled and greeted all the women in the audience, either not noticing or not acknowledging their pre-approach bra hoists and Binaca squirts. Who could figure out love, anyway? Not a bunch of guys who eat egg whites and protein shakes and live together and date the same girl. Not the millions of women watching them. Maybe not even Chris Harrison, who, to me, feels like the only man left in all of California: his chest full of hair, his omelets full of yolk, his heart full of loss and fortitude.</p><p
