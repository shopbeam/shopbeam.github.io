  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AStephen Colbert has been in character on television for a decade. That is…a long time. And as been much debated since he announced his move to CBS&amp;#x2019;s The Late Show, is it possible to imagine him out of it? It is a difficult tonal shift, with plenty of risk involved—after the public has bought into one comedic persona, it will take time and patience before they necessarily buy into another. In the words of the host himself, he&amp;#x2019;s now gotta &amp;#x201C;find out how much of him was me.&amp;#x201D;\u000A\u000ABut Colbert has always been regarded as one of the savviest navigators in comedy. He has come a long way from his days as a box-office volunteer alongside Jeff Garlin at the Second City, and his sharp show-business perceptions have a lot to do with it. He&amp;#x2019;s arguably the most successful in a circle of Chicago alums—his graduating class alone includes pals like Steve Carrell and Amy Sedaris—and his choice to remain in character all these years was partially inspired by Don Novello, the comedian who found fame as SNL&amp;#x2019;s deadpan Father Guido Sarducci. &amp;#x201C;I loved Novello&amp;#x2019;s stuff so much I wanted to ape it,&amp;#x201D; Colbert once told Paul Provenza, &amp;#x201C;[T]here&amp;#x2019;s some of that DNA in what I do, for sure.&amp;#x201D;\u000A\u000AThat DNA has earned him four primetime Emmys, plus countless other awards and nominations. And while it&amp;#x2019;s a huge risk to shed the character and leave that known success behind, the guy is nothing if not a brave son of a bitch. Consider his turn ridiculing the president in front of an audience of D.C. sycophants back in 2006, arguably the most audacious comic performance of all time. There is a long tradition of comedians performing to the most powerful man in the world, of course, but the relationship was always cordial—Bob Hope only dared ridicule President Eisenhower&amp;#x2019;s golf game. Mort Sahl took on Washington, but only from the safety of the nightclub stage. Pat Paulsen satirized wrongheaded policies, but merely from the CBS Television City soundstage. At the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2006, Colbert dared direct his comic insults with the president watching just a few seats away:\u000A\u000A Wow, what an honor. The White House Correspondents dinner. To actually sit here at the same table with my hero, George W. Bush, to be this close to the man. I feel like I&amp;#x2019;m dreaming. Somebody pinch me. You know what? I&amp;#x2019;m a pretty sound sleeper; that may not be enough. Somebody shoot me in the face. Is he [Vice President Cheney] really not here tonight? Damn it. The one guy who could have helped. Mark Smith, ladies and gentlemen of the press corps, Madame First Lady, Mr. President, my name is Stephen Colbert, and tonight it is my privilege to celebrate this president, because we&amp;#x2019;re not so different, he and I. We both get it. Guys like us, we&amp;#x2019;re not some brainiacs on the nerd patrol. We&amp;#x2019;re not members of the fact-inista. We go straight from the gut. Right, sir?\u000A\u000A That&amp;#x2019;s where the truth lies, right down here in the gut. Do you know you have more nerve endings in your gut than you have in your head? You can look it up. Now, I know some of you are going to say, &amp;#x2018;I did look it up, and that&amp;#x2019;s not true.&amp;#x2019; That&amp;#x2019;s cause you looked it up in a book. Next time, look it up in your gut. I did. My gut tells me that&amp;#x2019;s how our nervous system works. Every night on my show, The Colbert Report, I speak straight from the gut, okay? I give people the truth, unfiltered by rational argument. I call it the No Fact Zone. Fox News, I hold a copyright on that term … I believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least. And by these standards, we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq. Most of all, I believe in this president. Now, I know there are some polls out there saying that this man has a thirty-two percent approval rating. But guys like us, we don&amp;#x2019;t pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in &amp;#x2018;reality.&amp;#x2019; And reality has a well-known liberal bias.\u000A\u000AYou&amp;#x2019;ll remember that at first the news, for the most part, ignored Colbert&amp;#x2019;s performance. Most of the focus was given to the other comedian at the function, Frank Calienda, who did a crowd-pleasing impression of President Bush that got most of the news ink. The few pieces that mentioned Colbert&amp;#x2019;s roasting at all simply stated that he had bombed—his performance made much of the crowd uncomfortable. C-SPAN, not having amplified the audience, made it look like a bomb of catastrophic proportions.\u000A\u000ABut the weeks and months that followed, Colbert&amp;#x2019;s performance gained traction. The C-SPAN site offered a view of two separate feeds—one of Colbert&amp;#x2019;s roast in its entirety—and another of a camera focused solely on the annoyed face of the president as Colbert performed. When the video was uploaded to a brand new website called YouTube, it reached a massive audience. It was suddenly hailed as a legendary act of bravery.\u000A\u000AAllison Silverman, co-creator of The Colbert Report, was in attendance that night and had helped prepare the material: &amp;#x201C;A group of writers worked on that speech together,&amp;#x201D; she later said. &amp;#x201C;This is the type of material we write every night. It never occurred to me that it would affect the audience so intensely. But what we didn&amp;#x2019;t take into consideration was who the audience was going to be: politicians and press people. When we had rehearsed that speech a few hours before, in front of hotel staff, we never had any sense that there might be a problem. So when I witnessed the reaction, I was shocked. Shocked. I was actually sitting with Stephen&amp;#x2019;s family. Very close to me were Karl Rove and other insiders. I was in the thick of it. The speech definitely wasn&amp;#x2019;t getting a great response. Stephen is a fearless performer. He just kept committing to it, plowing forward... It was inspiring. Stephen only went up to the dais with the specific purpose of being funny. We had no idea how the speech would be perceived. Even later, when we did find out, we were surprised by the strength of response. The reaction to that speech was a lesson on how many people wanted a voice of criticism at that time.&amp;#x201D; It was a moment that enshrined Colbert in comic infamy—and perhaps proves he&amp;#x2019;ll be impervious any initial turbulence in new gig.\u000A\u000ALastly, unlike the characters of Don Novello, Stephen Colbert has played his signature &amp;#x201C;active idiot&amp;#x201D; under his own name. This distinction is the most awkward problem for his new Late Show—comedians past have switched personas in the past and succeeded, but typically by abandoning a character in both spirit and name, and there is always a period of initial resistance. Still, pioneering character-comedians Bert Lahr and Ed Wynn switched gears in the &amp;#x2019;50s, moving from their established reputations as obnoxious comedians into the world of dramatic acting. Lahr did Waiting for Godot on Broadway and Wynn won awards for Requiem for a Heavyweight. Resistance to their decision was heavy, until both men proved themselves in their new genre. Bobcat Goldthwait switched from his persona of a screaming, longhair rebel known to the more subdued and dapper gent he is today. And Steve Martin walked away from his white suits and props in the early &amp;#x2019;80s, at the height of his fame, and managed to sustain an extraordinary career as a movie star and Renaissance guy. It is not impossible for somebody to switch gears mid-career and discard their most successful guise, but there will be an inevitable period of adjustment. Provided he&amp;#x2019;s given time by notoriously impatient network suits to find his way, lessons of history indicate Stephen Colbert will kill it—so let&amp;#x2019;s be patient.",

been in character on television for a decade. That is&#x2026;a long time. And as been <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2014/04/10/stephen-colbert-taking-over-david-lettermans-late-night-spot/">much debated</a> since he announced his move to CBS&amp;#x2019;s <em>The Late Show, </em>is it possible to imagine him <em>out</em> of it? It is a difficult tonal shift, with plenty of risk involved&#x2014;after the public has bought into one comedic persona, it will take time and patience before they necessarily buy into another. In the words of the host himself, he&amp;#x2019;s now gotta &amp;#x201C;<a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/stephen-colbert-i-wont-be-695132">find out how much of <em>him was me</em></a>.&amp;#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1fhle956z28.1.1.0.0.4.2">But Colbert has always been regarded as one of the savviest navigators in comedy. He has come a long way from his days as a box-office volunteer alongside Jeff Garlin at the Second City, and his sharp show-business perceptions have a lot to do with it. He&amp;#x2019;s arguably the most successful in a circle of Chicago alums&#x2014;his graduating class alone includes pals like Steve Carrell and Amy Sedaris&#x2014;and his choice to remain in character all these years was partially inspired by Don Novello, the comedian who found fame as <em>SNL&amp;#x2019;</em>s deadpan Father Guido Sarducci. &amp;#x201C;I loved Novello&amp;#x2019;s stuff so much I wanted to ape it,&amp;#x201D; Colbert once told Paul Provenza, &amp;#x201C;[T]here&amp;#x2019;s some of that DNA in what I do, for sure.&amp;#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1fhle956z28.1.1.0.0.4.3">That DNA has earned him four primetime Emmys, plus countless other awards and nominations. And while it&amp;#x2019;s a huge risk to shed the character and leave that known success behind, the guy is nothing if not a brave son of a bitch. Consider his turn ridiculing the president in front of an audience of D.C. sycophants back in 2006, arguably the most audacious comic performance <em>of all time.</em> There is a long tradition of comedians performing to the most powerful man in the world, of course, but the relationship was always cordial&#x2014;Bob Hope only dared ridicule President Eisenhower&amp;#x2019;s golf game. Mort Sahl took on Washington, but only from the safety of the nightclub stage. Pat Paulsen satirized wrongheaded policies, but merely from the CBS Television City soundstage. At the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2006, Colbert dared direct his comic insults with the president watching just a few seats away:</p><p data-reactid=".1fhle956z28.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <em>Wow, what an honor. The White House Correspondents dinner. To actually sit here at the same table with my hero, George W. Bush, to be this close to the man. I feel like I&amp;#x2019;m dreaming. Somebody pinch me. You know what? I&amp;#x2019;m a pretty sound sleeper; that may not be enough. Somebody shoot me in the face. Is he [Vice President Cheney] really not here tonight? Damn it. The one guy who could have helped. Mark Smith, ladies and gentlemen of the press corps, Madame First Lady, Mr. President, my name is Stephen Colbert, and tonight it is my privilege to celebrate this president, because we&amp;#x2019;re not so different, he and I. We both get it. Guys like us, we&amp;#x2019;re not some brainiacs on the nerd patrol. We&amp;#x2019;re not members of the fact-inista. We go straight from the gut. Right, sir?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1fhle956z28.1.1.0.0.4.6"> <em>That&amp;#x2019;s where the truth lies, right down here in the gut. Do you know you have more nerve endings in your gut than you have in your head? You can look it up. Now, I know some of you are going to say, &amp;#x2018;I did look it up, and that&amp;#x2019;s not true.&amp;#x2019; That&amp;#x2019;s cause you looked it up in a book. Next time, look it up in your gut. I did. My gut tells me that&amp;#x2019;s how our nervous system works. Every night on my show, The Colbert Report, I speak straight from the gut, okay? I give people the truth, unfiltered by rational argument. I call it the No Fact Zone. Fox News, I hold a copyright on that term &#x2026; I believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least. And by these standards, we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq. Most of all, I believe in this president. Now, I know there are some polls out there saying that this man has a thirty-two percent approval rating. But guys like us, we don&amp;#x2019;t pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in &amp;#x2018;reality.&amp;#x2019; And reality has a well-known liberal bias.</em></p><p data-reactid=".1fhle956z28.1.1.0.0.4.7">You&amp;#x2019;ll remember that at first the news, for the most part, ignored Colbert&amp;#x2019;s performance. Most of the focus was given to the other comedian at the function, Frank Calienda, who did a crowd-pleasing impression of President Bush that got most of the news ink. The few pieces that mentioned Colbert&amp;#x2019;s roasting at all simply stated that he had bombed&#x2014;his performance made much of the crowd uncomfortable. C-SPAN, not having amplified the audience, made it look like a bomb of <em>catastrophic </em>proportions.</p><p data-reactid=".1fhle956z28.1.1.0.0.4.8">But the weeks and months that followed, Colbert&amp;#x2019;s performance gained traction. The C-SPAN site offered a view of two separate feeds&#x2014;one of Colbert&amp;#x2019;s roast in its entirety&#x2014;and another of a camera focused solely on the annoyed face of the president as Colbert performed. When the video was uploaded to a brand new website called YouTube, it reached a massive audience. It was suddenly hailed as a legendary act of bravery.</p><p data-reactid=".1fhle956z28.1.1.0.0.4.9">Allison Silverman, co-creator of <em>The Colbert Report,</em> was in attendance that night and had helped prepare the material: &amp;#x201C;A group of writers worked on that speech together,&amp;#x201D; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/And-Heres-Kicker-Conversations-Writers/dp/1582975051">she later said</a>. &amp;#x201C;This is the type of material we write every night. It never occurred to me that it would affect the audience so intensely. But what we didn&amp;#x2019;t take into consideration was who the audience was going to be: politicians and press people. When we had rehearsed that speech a few hours before, in front of hotel staff, we never had any sense that there might be a problem. So when I witnessed the reaction, I was shocked. <em>Shocked</em>. I was actually sitting with Stephen&amp;#x2019;s family. Very close to me were Karl Rove and other insiders. I was in the <em>thick</em> of it. The speech definitely wasn&amp;#x2019;t getting a great response. Stephen is a fearless performer. He just kept committing to it, plowing forward... It was inspiring. Stephen only went up to the dais with the specific purpose of being funny. We had no idea how the speech would be perceived. Even later, when we did find out, we were surprised by the strength of response. The reaction to that speech was a lesson on how many people wanted a voice of criticism at that time.&amp;#x201D; It was a moment that enshrined Colbert in comic infamy&#x2014;and perhaps proves he&amp;#x2019;ll be impervious any initial turbulence in new gig.</p><p data-reactid=".1fhle956z28.1.1.0.0.4.a">Lastly, unlike the characters of Don Novello, Stephen Colbert has played his signature &amp;#x201C;active idiot&amp;#x201D; under his own name. This distinction is the most awkward problem for his new <em>Late Show</em>&#x2014;comedians past have switched personas in the past and succeeded, but typically by abandoning a character in both spirit and name, and there is always a period of initial resistance. Still, pioneering character-comedians Bert Lahr and Ed Wynn switched gears in the &amp;#x2019;50s, moving from their established reputations as obnoxious comedians into the world of dramatic acting. Lahr did <em>Waiting for Godot </em>on Broadway and Wynn won awards for <em>Requiem for a Heavyweight</em>. Resistance to their decision was heavy, until both men proved themselves in their new genre. Bobcat Goldthwait switched from his persona of a screaming, longhair rebel known to the more subdued and dapper gent he is today. And Steve Martin walked away from his white suits and props in the early &amp;#x2019;80s, at the height of his fame, and managed to sustain an extraordinary career as a movie star and Renaissance guy. It is not impossible for somebody to switch gears mid-career and discard their most successful guise, but there will be an inevitable period of adjustment. Provided he&amp;#x2019;s given time by notoriously impatient network suits to find his way, lessons of history indicate Stephen Colbert will kill it&#x2014;so let&amp;#x2019;s be patient.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1fhle956z28.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1fhle956z28.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
