  	    "articleBody": "Thirty-five-year-old rapper Flo Rida has ripped an ongoing streak of number-one club-bangers, sold millions of records, amassed over a billion YouTube views, and been nominated for three Grammy Awards. And while  some confusion may persist for how to pronounce his name, nothing seems to slow the Flo—his latest single  \u0022G.D.F.R.\u0022 has just gone platinum, and his new EP, \u0022My House,\u0022 drops next month. The Mr. Rida joined us this week to reflect on club-hopping strategy, his favorite spring break memories, and his status as America\u0027s incumbent party laureate.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Tell us your first spring break memory.  \u000A\u000AAs a kid in the projects, I always looked forward to spring break. We\u0027d either have cousins visiting us for the week from up north and we\u0027d all play sports together, or sometimes I\u0027d go to Vero Beach and hang with my cousins there. I was a teenager, too young to go to the club, but my cousins had an insane collection of cassette tapes, so we started throwing house parties. We\u0027d DJ parties on the stereo, even on a boom box, having spent all day cueing up each tape to just the right song. It was pretty wild and the parties went all night. But I was super-shy back then.  \u000A\u000AHow did get over your shyness? What changed?  \u000A\u000AIn my late teens and early 20s, I started selling mix CDs on the street. My first love was basketball, but that wasn\u0027t gonna launch me, and I knew I had to get into other things. So me and my friends, we started making mix CDs and going down to South Beach or to the parking lot at Pitbull concerts to spend all night hustling. I was amazed—people were buying the CDs up like crazy! We\u0027d only sleep an hour a night, we were hitting the streets so hard. And the shyness faded with every CD I sold, seeing that I could make money off my passion.  \u000A\u000AWhat was your pitch? What would you say to people?  \u000A\u000AI\u0027d just be like: Hey, we got some hot music, check it out. $5 for a CD. If you don\u0027t want a CD, we got T-shirts, too. See, we always had shirts and CDs. If they don\u0027t want a CD, we\u0027ll sell them a shirt and slip them the CD anyway. That way we were always getting our music into people\u0027s hands. The best targets were folks in the parking lot playing music in their car. I never had anybody with music on turn me down.   \u000A\u000AOver time, you get a sense for what people are all about, and learn to feel their spirit. I always tried to have a nice approach and be friendly and open; having the right attitude sold a lot of CDs. It\u0027s not that I\u0027m never shy anymore, I just know how to go on stage and become a ball of energy and turn into a whole different beast. At this point, I can turn it on and off.  \u000A\u000AWhat does being from Florida mean to you?  \u000A\u000ABeing from Miami, you\u0027re used to the fact that your home is a vacation spot. But that\u0027s what makes Miami one of the best places in the world. We\u0027re so rich in different cultures, being so close to Haiti, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico, and then you\u0027ve got people who travel from all over the world just to come visit. So when it comes time for Spring Break or the holidays, it just means we crank the party level up another notch.  \u000A\u000A What about partying has changed as you\u0027ve gotten older?   \u000A\u000AI remember when I was 19 years old, still in high school, and Kobe Bryant had just signed with the Lakers. He came to Miami for spring break. I was underage but there was this massive party on the beach, and I managed to get in. The vibe was so cool. I saw Kobe, Shaquille O\u0027Neal, Trina, Trick Daddy, and all these others, and I was just amazed. I was this young dude from the projects surrounded by all these celebrities, and I was like, Damn, one day I want to be able to party like these guys.  \u000A\u000AI wanted it to become my way of life—not just one party one night that I\u0027d crashed that one time.  \u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s the craziest party experience you\u0027ve ever had?   \u000A\u000AHere\u0027s the wildest: In 2002, I was about 22, and I was performing in a night club in Miami during spring break with my old group the GroundHoggz, and this guy who worked at the club also worked with 2 Live Crew. He told me they needed someone to be the hype man for [2 Live Crew member] Fresh Kid Ice for a show in Hawaii. I\u0027d grown up listening to 2 Live Crew\u0027s music, and now I\u0027d be getting a chance to meet Fresh Kid Ice in person.  \u000A\u000ASo I go to the airport, and on the plane I had to learn all the lyrics to all the songs. I landed in Hawaii and the show was that very same night. I had no idea how crazy things were about to get. I mean, people come to these shows well prepared to lose their minds. We got to the venue and before I knew it, I was signing autographs, girls were crying and taking their clothes off—some of them had mistaken me for LL Cool J—and I was like, Whoa. I\u0027d been part of their crew for one day. That\u0027s what made me really want to pursue music: I got a sense for the places it could take you. I thought, Damn, if I get on like this myself one day, it\u0027ll be the wildest.  \u000A\u000AWhat about your all-time best spring break?  \u000A\u000AIn 2008, my first album had just dropped, and I was doing MTV Spring Break concerts in Panama City, Myrtle Beach, and Mexico. This was right after  \u0022Low\u0022 [with T-Pain] had been released, and I\u0027d only just started performing the song. It was crazy! We had girls onstage dancing, and I was going out into the crowd spraying champagne. To look out across that sea of bodies, everyone freaking out, the excitement in people\u0027s faces, I had this feeling: I could definitely get addicted to this. After grinding for so many years, my career was finally taking off. People were taking pictures with me, I was signing autographs—and not because I was rolling with 2 Live Crew or they thought I was LL Cool J. What a rush to experience all of that for the first time.  \u000A\u000AIt\u0027s funny. Everyone was on spring break, but I was thinking about how hard we\u0027d worked to craft those songs.  \u000A\u000AWhere do you write your songs?  \u000A\u000AI I like to just get in the car and drive to the ocean and look out over the waves. Sometimes I\u0027ll work in the studio, or sit in my office with my feet up on the desk. Writing is such a private practice, really. It\u0027s intimate. I\u0027ve written records in lonely hotel rooms. It\u0027s crazy to think about writing the songs in such solitude—but then to find myself with a crowd of thousands, singing the words back to me.  \u000A\u000AA lot of the time when you\u0027re writing a record you\u0027re thinking about what kind of response you want from the audience; you can actually imagine the fun they\u0027ll be having. As I\u0027m writing I\u0027m imagining what it might be like to perform this song at a spring break party or a concert, and I\u0027m wondering, How will people respond?   \u000A\u000AWhy do you think your sound is so iconic to revelers?   \u000A\u000AI think it\u0027s because I grew up in a place that\u0027s known for partying. It\u0027s in me. I see it. I live it. It\u0027s completely organic. My songs represent the life of the party and I always love bringing the fans on stage so they can rock it out and party with me. It keeps it fresh for me, having strangers up there; it lets the fans know how much I appreciate them; and I love giving people the moment of a lifetime and watching them basically lose their minds.  \u000A\u000ACan spring break happen anywhere  outside  of Florida?!  \u000A\u000AIn Cannes I did a few shows and in a way it was like Miami, with all these different cultures coming together. Really, I saw more similarities to how we do it back home than differences. But one thing really grabbed me. I\u0027m used to going to the club and popping bottles, and people always think it\u0027s a lot of bottles, but over in Cannes I\u0027ve seen people pop literally a thousand Cristal bottles! We got to the club and they were rolling the bottles out in huge refrigerators. The same night Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg and Kurupt were performing, so people at the club were really showing off. Jimmy Iovine was in the corner sipping on something, and my DJ and I, we actually had so many Cristal bottles we were pouring them out on the ground. It was completely insane.  \u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s your dream party-vacation day—the whole thing, morning \u0027til night?  \u000A\u000AI\u0027d want to have some friends in town. We\u0027d go out on a yacht, do some jet-skiing, and hang out at Mango\u0027s on South Beach, and then hit the Fontainebleau—they have a wonderful pool there. At night we\u0027d go out on the town, moving from one club to the next, and then on to another one.  \u000A\u000ABasically, what I did last night.  \u000A\u000AHere\u0027s something we\u0027ve always wondered: How do you know, specifically, when it\u0027s time to move from one club on to the next?  \u000A\u000AYou have to take a long view on the whole night and budget your time. You give yourself only a certain amount of time at each club because you want to hit all of them. So when you enter the club, remind yourself, \u0022Okay, we\u0027ve got an hour and a half here, and then we got to keep it moving.\u0022 You also have to know what time each club is gonna close to pace yourself just right. And always save the best club for last...  \u000A\u000AWhat does a Flo Rida-hosted spring break look like?  \u000A\u000AYou want to make sure everyone is looking good and feeling fit, since everyone\u0027s gonna be taking off their shirts. You want that bikini body, so the best thing to do is to go the gym every day and stay in shape. I actually have a cardio workout program that just came out called Flo Fit, which I recommend.  \u000A\u000AThe main thing [in life] is to handle your business, but also make time to hang out with your friends. Don\u0027t be all work and no play. Listen to some Flo Rida music, don\u0027t get too deep in the grind, and prioritize your social time, just like you would on spring break. Remember, spring break is not a once-a-year kind of thing—spring break is a state of mind.  \u000A\u000ADavy Rothbart is the author of  My Heart is an Idiot, a book of personal essays, co-director of the documentary  Medora, and the creator of  FOUND Magazine.

data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.0">Thirty-five-year-old rapper Flo Rida has ripped an ongoing streak of number-one club-bangers, sold millions of records, amassed over a billion YouTube views, and been nominated for three Grammy Awards. And while  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLoYVjDTYsM">some confusion may persist</a> for how to pronounce his name, nothing seems to slow the Flo&#x2014;his latest single  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8Cg572dafQ">&quot;G.D.F.R.&quot;</a> has just gone platinum, and his new EP, &quot;My House,&quot; drops next month. <em>The </em>Mr. Rida joined us this week to reflect on club-hopping strategy, his favorite spring break memories, and his status as America&apos;s incumbent party laureate.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.1"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.2"> <strong>Tell us your first spring break memory.</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.3">As a kid in the projects, I always looked forward to spring break. We&apos;d either have cousins visiting us for the week from up north and we&apos;d all play sports together, or sometimes I&apos;d go to Vero Beach and hang with my cousins there. I was a teenager, too young to go to the club, but my cousins had an insane collection of cassette tapes, so we started throwing house parties. We&apos;d DJ parties on the stereo, even on a boom box, having spent all day cueing up each tape to just the right song. It was pretty wild and the parties went all night. But I was super-shy back then.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>How did get over your shyness? What changed?</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.6">In my late teens and early 20s, I started selling mix CDs on the street. My first love was basketball, but that wasn&apos;t gonna launch me, and I knew I had to get into other things. So me and my friends, we started making mix CDs and going down to South Beach or to the parking lot at Pitbull concerts to spend all night hustling. I was amazed&#x2014;people were <em>buying the CDs up like crazy! </em>We&apos;d only sleep an hour a night, we were hitting the streets so hard. And the shyness faded with every CD I sold, seeing that I could make money off my passion.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>What was your pitch? What would you say to people?</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.8">I&apos;d just be like: <em>Hey, we got some hot music, check it out. $5 for a CD. If you don&apos;t want a CD, we got T-shirts, too.</em> See, we always had shirts <em>and</em> CDs. If they don&apos;t want a CD, we&apos;ll sell them a shirt and slip them the CD anyway. That way we were always getting our music into people&apos;s hands. The best targets were folks in the parking lot playing music in their car. I never had anybody with music on turn me down.   </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.9">Over time, you get a sense for what people are all about, and learn to feel their spirit. I always tried to have a nice approach and be friendly and open; having the right attitude sold a lot of CDs. It&apos;s not that I&apos;m never shy anymore, I just know how to go on stage and become a ball of energy and turn into a whole different beast. At this point, I can turn it on and off.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>What does being from Florida mean to you?</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.b">Being from Miami, you&apos;re used to the fact that your home is a vacation spot. But that&apos;s what makes Miami one of the best places in the world. We&apos;re so rich in different cultures, being so close to Haiti, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico, and then you&apos;ve got people who travel from all over the world just to come visit. So when it comes time for Spring Break or the holidays, it just means we crank the party level up another notch.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong> What about partying has changed as you&apos;ve gotten older?</strong>   </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.d">I remember when I was 19 years old, still in high school, and Kobe Bryant had just signed with the Lakers. He came to Miami for spring break. I was underage but there was this massive party on the beach, and I managed to get in. The vibe was so cool. I saw Kobe, Shaquille O&apos;Neal, Trina, Trick Daddy, and all these others, and I was just amazed. I was this young dude from the projects surrounded by all these celebrities, and I was like<em>, Damn, one day I want to be able to party like these guys</em>.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.e">I wanted it to become my way of life&#x2014;not just one party one night that I&apos;d crashed that one time.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>What&apos;s the craziest party experience you&apos;ve ever had?</strong>   </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.g">Here&apos;s the wildest: In 2002, I was about 22, and I was performing in a night club in Miami during spring break with my old group the GroundHoggz, and this guy who worked at the club also worked with 2 Live Crew. He told me they needed someone to be the hype man for [2 Live Crew member] Fresh Kid Ice for a show in Hawaii. I&apos;d grown up listening to 2 Live Crew&apos;s music, and now I&apos;d be getting a chance to meet Fresh Kid Ice in person.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.h">So I go to the airport, and on the plane I had to learn <em>all </em>the lyrics to <em>all </em>the songs. I landed in Hawaii and the show was that very same night. I had no idea how crazy things were about to get. I mean, people come to these shows well prepared to lose their minds. We got to the venue and before I knew it, I was signing autographs, girls were crying and taking their clothes off&#x2014;some of them had mistaken me for LL Cool J&#x2014;and I was like, <em>Whoa</em>. I&apos;d been part of their crew for <em>one day</em>. That&apos;s what made me really want to pursue music: I got a sense for the places it could take you. I thought, <em>Damn, if I get on like this myself one day, it&apos;ll be the wildest.</em>  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>What about your all-time best spring break?</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.j">In 2008, my first album had just dropped, and I was doing <em>MTV Spring Break</em> concerts in Panama City, Myrtle Beach, and Mexico. This was right after  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLwvc5Qywzk">&quot;Low&quot; [with T-Pain]</a> had been released, and I&apos;d only just started performing the song. It was <em>crazy!</em> We had girls onstage dancing, and I was going out into the crowd spraying champagne. To look out across that sea of bodies, everyone freaking out, the excitement in people&apos;s faces, I had this feeling<em>: I could definitely get addicted to this. </em>After grinding for so many years, my career was finally taking off. People were taking pictures with me, I was signing autographs&#x2014;and not because I was rolling with 2 Live Crew or they thought I was LL Cool J. What a <em>rush</em> to experience all of that for the first time.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.k">It&apos;s funny. Everyone was on spring break, but I was thinking about how hard we&apos;d worked to craft those songs.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>Where do you write your songs?</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.m">I I like to just get in the car and drive to the ocean and look out over the waves. Sometimes I&apos;ll work in the studio, or sit in my office with my feet up on the desk. Writing is such a private practice, really. It&apos;s intimate. I&apos;ve written records in lonely hotel rooms. It&apos;s crazy to think about writing the songs in such solitude&#x2014;but then to find myself with a crowd of thousands, singing the words back to me.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.n">A lot of the time when you&apos;re writing a record you&apos;re thinking about what kind of response you want from the audience; you can actually imagine the fun they&apos;ll be having. As I&apos;m writing I&apos;m imagining what it might be like to perform this song at a spring break party or a concert, and I&apos;m wondering, <em>How will people respond?</em>   </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>Why do you think your sound is so iconic to revelers?</strong>   </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.p">I think it&apos;s because I grew up in a place that&apos;s known for partying. It&apos;s in me. I see it. I live it. It&apos;s completely organic. My songs represent the life of the party and I always love bringing the fans on stage so they can rock it out and party with me. It keeps it fresh for me, having strangers up there; it lets the fans know how much I appreciate them; and I love giving people the moment of a lifetime and watching them basically lose their minds.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>Can spring break happen anywhere </strong><strong> outside  </strong><strong>of Florida?!</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.r">In Cannes I did a few shows and in a way it was like Miami, with all these different cultures coming together. Really, I saw more similarities to how we do it back home than differences. But one thing really grabbed me. I&apos;m used to going to the club and popping bottles, and people always think it&apos;s a lot of bottles, but over in Cannes I&apos;ve seen people pop literally <em>a thousand</em> Cristal bottles! We got to the club and they were rolling the bottles out in huge refrigerators. The same night Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg and Kurupt were performing, so people at the club were really showing off. Jimmy Iovine was in the corner sipping on something, and my DJ and I, we actually had so many Cristal bottles we were pouring them out on the ground. It was completely insane.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>What&apos;s your dream party-vacation day&#x2014;the whole thing, morning &apos;til night?</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.t">I&apos;d want to have some friends in town. We&apos;d go out on a yacht, do some jet-skiing, and hang out at Mango&apos;s on South Beach, and then hit the Fontainebleau&#x2014;they have a wonderful pool there. At night we&apos;d go out on the town, moving from one club to the next, and then on to another one.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.u">Basically, what I did last night.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>Here&apos;s something we&apos;ve always wondered: How do you know, specifically, when it&apos;s time to move from one club on to the next?</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.w">You have to take a long view on the whole night and budget your time. You give yourself only a certain amount of time at each club because you want to hit all of them. So when you enter the club, remind yourself, &quot;Okay, we&apos;ve got an hour and a half here, and then we got to keep it moving.&quot; You also have to know what time each club is gonna close to pace yourself just right. And <em>always </em>save the best club for last...  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>What does a Flo Rida-hosted spring break look like?</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.y">You want to make sure everyone is looking good and feeling fit, since everyone&apos;s gonna be taking off their shirts. You want that bikini body, so the best thing to do is to go the gym every day and stay in shape. I actually have a cardio workout program that just came out called <em>Flo Fit, </em>which I recommend.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.z">The main thing [in life] is to handle your business, but also make time to hang out with your friends. Don&apos;t be all work and no play. Listen to some Flo Rida music, don&apos;t get too deep in the grind, and prioritize your social time, just like you would on spring break. Remember, spring break is not a once-a-year kind of thing&#x2014;spring break is a state of mind.  </p><p data-reactid=".jlujlr2n0g.1.1.0.0.4.10">Davy Rothbart is the author of  <a href="http://www.myheartisanidiotbook.com/"><em>My Heart is an Idiot</em></a>, a book of personal essays, co-director of the documentary  <a href="http://www.medorafilm.com/"><em>Medora</em></a>, and the creator of  <a href="http://www.foundmagazine.com/"><em>FOUND Magazine</em></a>.
