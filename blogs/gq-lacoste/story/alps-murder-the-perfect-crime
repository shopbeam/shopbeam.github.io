  	    "articleBody": "Saad al-Hilli drove onto a ferry in Dover and then off again at Calais on August 30, 2012, the week before the murders. There are security cameras at the terminal, and more cameras at toll plazas and gas stations and along the highway. The gendarmes pulled thousands of images from those cameras, and they scoured them for the maroon BMW with UK plates pulling a white camper. Then they compared those photos with each other, looking for another car or a motorcycle that appeared in several or at least more than one. They did not ﬁnd one.\u000A\u000A\u0022We\u0027re quite sure they weren\u0027t followed,\u0022 Eric Maillaud says now. \u0022We can\u0027t be completely sure\u0022—it is possible, though vanishingly improbable, that someone was clever enough to remain outside the ﬁeld of vision of every single CCTV lens across the length of France—\u0022but you never see the same vehicle twice. Not even one time do you see the same vehicle.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat is: No one tailed the al-Hillis to Le Solitaire du Lac.\u000A\u000AOn the family\u0027s second morning at the campground, September 5, Saad asked his daughter Zainab what she would like to do that afternoon. He could take her shopping in Annecy, or they could go for a walk in the woods. Zainab said she wanted to walk in the woods.\u000A\u000ASaad knew the general area, but not the best paths into the wilderness. He asked the man at the campground, the one with the ruddy face and the gray hair and the pitchfork, where he should take his family. The campground man might have suggested the narrow road climbing out of Chevaline or he might have suggested Saad take a hairpin left at the bottom. It\u0027s easy enough to miss. Or he might have suggested somewhere else entirely; he wouldn\u0027t say. In any case, once Saad started up the mountain, he had no choice but to continue to the parking area three kilometers on.\u000A\u000A\u0022We know,\u0022 Maillaud tells me, \u0022and this is a certitude, that when they found themselves at the top of the Combe d\u0027Ire, it was not the father\u0027s choice.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt was Zainab\u0027s choice, and perhaps a navigational misstep.\u000A\u000ASaad passed Sylvain Mollier on the way up. He, too, apparently had gotten lost. His girlfriend\u0027s father had suggested a route, and Maillaud wonders if maybe Mollier was supposed to have taken that same sharp left at the bottom. But he started pedaling up a mountain instead, and he could have turned around, but some people would rather keep going. \u0022An athlete,\u0022 Maillaud says, \u0022is stubborn.\u0022\u000A\u000ANot far from the parking area, his mobile phone rang. It was Claire. Mollier was out of breath, panting. He told her he had to get to the top, and he\u0027d call her back.\u000A\u000AHe got off his bike near where the al-Hillis were parked. Saad was probably talking to him. Saad was always the outgoing one, Zaid says, chatty and friendly. Most likely he was asking about Mollier\u0027s bike. Saad liked bikes.\u000A\u000AThen the shooting started.\u000A\u000AAn early report said blood splatters on the soles of Saad\u0027s shoes indicated Mollier was shot ﬁrst, already bleeding before Saad got into the BMW. But Maillaud is ﬁrm that investigators do not know the order of the targets. That is a narrative detail, he says, that will need to be explained. \u0022Until we ﬁnd the killer,\u0022 he says, \u0022we won\u0027t know.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere was only one gunman. Maillaud is sure of that. The precision of the shooting, the two rounds in each head, suggests he is a professional; the number of bodies suggests he was experienced; and the attempted murder of a child suggests a hardened efficiency. Yet he left 21 shell casings on the ground, which a professional probably would not have, and he used an antique 7.65-millimeter Luger issued by the Swiss army more than 60 years ago, which a professional probably wouldn\u0027t do, either. The investigators are certain of the weapon, because a piece of the butt broke off when the shooter fractured Zainab\u0027s skull with it. They think he clubbed her because he ran out of bullets, which also is not professional.\u000A\u000ABeyond that, Maillaud is sure of nothing. He has found no reason for anyone to kill either Sylvain Mollier or Saad al-Hilli. In early March 2015, even his anonymous wild-card suspect, the man on the motorcycle, was ruled out. He\u0027d been discovered to be a businessman from Lyon who\u0027d been paragliding in the area. Maillaud won\u0027t release his name but insists he has no criminal record of any kind and no connection to any of the dead.\u000A\u000A\u0022Objectively,\u0022 Maillaud concedes, \u0022it is more and more improbable that Zaid did this.\u0022 This is not a conclusion he offers gracefully. \u0022Just because they hated each other, which they did,\u0022 he says, \u0022and just because they wanted to take each other\u0027s money, which they did, that doesn\u0027t mean he would kill everybody.\u0022\u000A\u000AWell, yes. But there\u0027s also the part about no one knowing Saad al-Hilli would be at the top of Combe d\u0027Ire that afternoon. Objectively, then, it\u0027s closer to impossible than improbable.\u000A\u000AIt is still possible, if remotely and implausibly, that Mollier was the target and Maillaud and all the others—dozens of investigators and magistrates and judges—know it. But that\u0027s an enormous amount of people to keep a horrifying secret, and Maillaud can\u0027t be that good a liar or that monstrous a person.\u000A\u000AAll of which leaves this: Neither al-Hilli nor Mollier was the target. They all were in the wrong place at the absolute worst time.\u000A\u000AMaillaud refuses to rank investigatory theories in a hierarchy. But that is semantic caution. The target, he says, \u0022was one, the other, or neither.\u0022 If there is no evidence for one or the other—and there isn\u0027t—there is only neither.\u000A\u000ASo that leaves a lone nut. A sociopath who, for reasons known only to him or her, loosed 21 rounds into ﬁve strangers. That would be the rarest of crimes, the stuff of campﬁre stories and ghost legends. But what else is there, except a monster in the forest? What had seemed so obvious—a purposeful, if sloppy, hit on a foreigner involved in something sinister—had dissolved into the most terrifying ambiguity, a random lunatic on a random day slaughtering random people with the tactical precision of an assassin.\u000A\u000AInvestigators cross-checked military records with those of psychiatric hospitals. They found no renegade patients, no one recently released with homicidal tendencies and excellent marksmanship. But in April 2014, while working through an extensive list of anyone Claire Schutz remembered ever knowing, detectives summoned a former soldier for a routine interview. His name was Patrice Menegaldo, he was 50 years old, and he lived in Ugine. He\u0027d been a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, an elite ﬁghting force composed partly of misﬁts and ruffians running away from something else; Legionnaires are not, by temperament or training, fragile men. He was asked questions for an hour and then sent on his way.\u000A\u000ATwo months later, Menegaldo shot himself in the head.\u000A\u000A\u0022He wrote a letter saying the reason was ‘I could not handle being a suspect in a murder,\u0027 \u0022 Maillaud says. He arches an eyebrow. \u0022That doesn\u0027t sound very believable. It doesn\u0027t make sense that a Legionnaire would kill himself after an hour in a police station.\u0022\u000A\u000ANo, it doesn\u0027t sound believable at all. Especially since Menegaldo was interviewed as a tangential witness. No one considered him a suspect.\u000A\u000AExcept, maybe, Menegaldo.\u000A\u000ABut why would he feel like a suspect? The detectives did not accuse him. He was never in custody. There was no evidence connecting him to the crime or to anyone involved, except for Claire\u0027s memory of having peripherally known him.\u000A\u000AHe did it. It was Menegaldo in the woods with the gun. That\u0027s what we\u0027re supposed to believe, or what we\u0027re supposed to want to believe. \u0022He corresponds,\u0022 Maillaud says, \u0022with the proﬁle of a crazy gunman.\u0022 It\u0027s an easy leap, then, a lunatic driven to suicide by the staggering weight of his guilt. He can\u0027t deny it now, can he?\u000A\u000ABut why wait two months after his interview to blow his brains out? And 21 months after he would\u0027ve tried to beat a little girl to death? And there\u0027s this: Why would he leave a seven-page suicide letter, the details of which Maillaud will not release?\u000A\u000AMaybe he was just a depressed old soldier with seven pages of reasons. There\u0027s still nothing tangible, or even reliably speculative, that puts Menegaldo on that mountain at that time.\u000A\u000ASo Maillaud is no further along on the third anniversary than he was at the second or the ﬁrst. Perhaps he truly is in the presence of a perfect crime.\u000A\u000AHe considers this. Afternoon sun pours through his windows, glints off the lake, carves shadows on the mountains. Annecy is beautiful in the early spring.\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t like,\u0022 he says after a moment, \u0022perfect crimes.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThere was one final angle. It popped up in July 2014, about the time reporters would have been preparing stories about the second anniversary of an unsolved quadruple homicide. It didn\u0027t get a lot of attention beyond the ﬁrst day or two, and maybe it didn\u0027t deserve to. But here it is:\u000A\u000ASeven hours after the murders in the Alps, a man named James Thompson told a friend he felt nauseated. He asked for some aspirin, left an antiques shop he ran in Natchez, Mississippi, U.S.A., and climbed into his truck.\u000A\u000AThompson was a former cop and an oil-ﬁeld worker. He also was divorced, amicably, from an Iraqi dentist he married in 1999, apparently as a favor. They split up a few months later. She moved to England, where she met an engineer named Saad al-Hilli. They courted for three months, got married, had two baby girls who were now 4 and 7. They vacationed in a white Bürstner camper towed behind Saad\u0027s maroon BMW, the last time to the shore of a cold, clear lake high in the mountains of eastern France.\u000A\u000AIqbal al-Hilli kept her ﬁrst marriage a secret. Not even Zaid knew, until French investigators announced it. \u0022She seemed to be this nice Muslim woman,\u0022 Maillaud says now, \u0022and here she married an American. People have exploded families for less than that.\u0022\u000A\u000AThompson pulled into the street. His truck veered to the right and rolled to a slow stop in the road. He had his foot on the brake, and the rest of him was slumped over the wheel. Dead.\u000A\u000AHe was overweight, and his blood pressure was high, and he smoked cigars, and he\u0027d just turned 60. That James Thompson would have a massive coronary was not startling. That he would suffer one seven hours after his secret ex-wife was shot twice in the head in an unsolved crime with no motive and no suspects is almost certainly a coincidence. So far as anyone can tell, at least, which isn\u0027t very far at all.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000APart One: Murder in the AlpsPart Two: The Iraqi ConnectionPart Three: The CyclistPart Four: The Arrest Part Five: The JournalistPart Six: The Perfect Crime\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASean Flynn is a GQ correspondent.",

data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.0">Saad al-Hilli drove onto a ferry in Dover and then off again at Calais on August 30, 2012, the week before the murders. There are security cameras at the terminal, and more cameras at toll plazas and gas stations and along the highway. The gendarmes pulled thousands of images from those cameras, and they scoured them for the maroon BMW with UK plates pulling a white camper. Then they compared those photos with each other, looking for another car or a motorcycle that appeared in several or at least more than one. They did not &#xFB01;nd one.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.1">&#x201C;We&#x2019;re quite sure they weren&#x2019;t followed,&#x201D; Eric Maillaud says now. &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t be completely sure&#x201D;&#x2014;it is possible, though vanishingly improbable, that someone was clever enough to remain outside the &#xFB01;eld of vision of every single CCTV lens across the length of France&#x2014;&#x201C;but you never see the same vehicle twice. Not even one time do you see the same vehicle.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.2">That is: No one tailed the al-Hillis to Le Solitaire du Lac.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.3">On the family&#x2019;s second morning at the campground, September 5, Saad asked his daughter Zainab what she would like to do that afternoon. He could take her shopping in Annecy, or they could go for a walk in the woods. Zainab said she wanted to walk in the woods.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.5">Saad knew the general area, but not the best paths into the wilderness. He asked the man at the campground, the one with the ruddy face and the gray hair and the pitchfork, where he should take his family. The campground man might have suggested the narrow road climbing out of Chevaline or he might have suggested Saad take a hairpin left at the bottom. It&#x2019;s easy enough to miss. Or he might have suggested somewhere else entirely; he wouldn&#x2019;t say. In any case, once Saad started up the mountain, he had no choice but to continue to the parking area three kilometers on.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.6">&#x201C;We know,&#x201D; Maillaud tells me, &#x201C;and this is a certitude, that when they found themselves at the top of the Combe d&#x2019;Ire, it was not the father&#x2019;s choice.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.7">It was Zainab&#x2019;s choice, and perhaps a navigational misstep.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.8">Saad passed Sylvain Mollier on the way up. He, too, apparently had gotten lost. His girlfriend&#x2019;s father had suggested a route, and Maillaud wonders if maybe Mollier was supposed to have taken that same sharp left at the bottom. But he started pedaling up a mountain instead, and he could have turned around, but some people would rather keep going. &#x201C;An athlete,&#x201D; Maillaud says, &#x201C;is stubborn.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.9">Not far from the parking area, his mobile phone rang. It was Claire. Mollier was out of breath, panting. He told her he had to get to the top, and he&#x2019;d call her back.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.a">He got off his bike near where the al-Hillis were parked. Saad was probably talking to him. Saad was always the outgoing one, Zaid says, chatty and friendly. Most likely he was asking about Mollier&#x2019;s bike. Saad liked bikes.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.b">Then the shooting started.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.c">An early report said blood splatters on the soles of Saad&#x2019;s shoes indicated Mollier was shot &#xFB01;rst, already bleeding before Saad got into the BMW. But Maillaud is &#xFB01;rm that investigators do not know the order of the targets. That is a narrative detail, he says, that will need to be explained. &#x201C;Until we &#xFB01;nd the killer,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;we won&#x2019;t know.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.d">There was only one gunman. Maillaud is sure of that. The precision of the shooting, the two rounds in each head, suggests he is a professional; the number of bodies suggests he was experienced; and the attempted murder of a child suggests a hardened efficiency. Yet he left 21 shell casings on the ground, which a professional probably would not have, and he used an antique 7.65-millimeter Luger issued by the Swiss army more than 60 years ago, which a professional probably wouldn&#x2019;t do, either. The investigators are certain of the weapon, because a piece of the butt broke off when the shooter fractured Zainab&#x2019;s skull with it. They think he clubbed her because he ran out of bullets, which also is not professional.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.e">Beyond that, Maillaud is sure of nothing. He has found no reason for anyone to kill either Sylvain Mollier or Saad al-Hilli. In early March 2015, even his anonymous wild-card suspect, the man on the motorcycle, was ruled out. He&#x2019;d been discovered to be a businessman from Lyon who&#x2019;d been paragliding in the area. Maillaud won&#x2019;t release his name but insists he has no criminal record of any kind and no connection to any of the dead.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.f">&#x201C;Objectively,&#x201D; Maillaud concedes, &#x201C;it is more and more improbable that Zaid did this.&#x201D; This is not a conclusion he offers gracefully. &#x201C;Just because they hated each other, which they did,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;and just because they wanted to take each other&#x2019;s money, which they did, that doesn&#x2019;t mean he would kill everybody.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.g">Well, yes. But there&#x2019;s also the part about no one knowing Saad al-Hilli would be at the top of Combe d&#x2019;Ire that afternoon. Objectively, then, it&#x2019;s closer to impossible than improbable.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.h">It is still possible, if remotely and implausibly, that Mollier was the target and Maillaud and all the others&#x2014;dozens of investigators and magistrates and judges&#x2014;know it. But that&#x2019;s an enormous amount of people to keep a horrifying secret, and Maillaud can&#x2019;t be that good a liar or that monstrous a person.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.i">All of which leaves this: Neither al-Hilli nor Mollier was the target. They all were in the wrong place at the absolute worst time.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.j">Maillaud refuses to rank investigatory theories in a hierarchy. But that is semantic caution. The target, he says, &#x201C;was one, the other, or neither.&#x201D; If there is no evidence for one or the other&#x2014;and there isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;there is only neither.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.k">So that leaves a lone nut. A sociopath who, for reasons known only to him or her, loosed 21 rounds into &#xFB01;ve strangers. That would be the rarest of crimes, the stuff of camp&#xFB01;re stories and ghost legends. But what else is there, except a monster in the forest? What had seemed so obvious&#x2014;a purposeful, if sloppy, hit on a foreigner involved in something sinister&#x2014;had dissolved into the most terrifying ambiguity, a random lunatic on a random day slaughtering random people with the tactical precision of an assassin.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.l">Investigators cross-checked military records with those of psychiatric hospitals. They found no renegade patients, no one recently released with homicidal tendencies and excellent marksmanship. But in April 2014, while working through an extensive list of anyone Claire Schutz remembered ever knowing, detectives summoned a former soldier for a routine interview. His name was Patrice Menegaldo, he was 50 years old, and he lived in Ugine. He&#x2019;d been a paratrooper in the French Foreign Legion, an elite &#xFB01;ghting force composed partly of mis&#xFB01;ts and ruffians running away from something else; Legionnaires are not, by temperament or training, fragile men. He was asked questions for an hour and then sent on his way.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.m">Two months later, Menegaldo shot himself in the head.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.n">&#x201C;He wrote a letter saying the reason was &#x2018;I could not handle being a suspect in a murder,&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; Maillaud says. He arches an eyebrow. &#x201C;That doesn&#x2019;t sound very believable. It doesn&#x2019;t make sense that a Legionnaire would kill himself after an hour in a police station.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.o">No, it doesn&#x2019;t sound believable at all. Especially since Menegaldo was interviewed as a tangential <em>witness.</em> No one considered him a suspect.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.p">Except, maybe, Menegaldo.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.q">But <em>why</em> would he feel like a suspect? The detectives did not accuse him. He was never in custody. There was no evidence connecting him to the crime or to anyone involved, except for Claire&#x2019;s memory of having peripherally known him.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.r">He did it. It was Menegaldo in the woods with the gun. That&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;re supposed to believe, or what we&#x2019;re supposed to <em>want</em> to believe. &#x201C;He corresponds,&#x201D; Maillaud says, &#x201C;with the pro&#xFB01;le of a crazy gunman.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s an easy leap, then, a lunatic driven to suicide by the staggering weight of his guilt. He can&#x2019;t deny it now, can he?</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.s">But why wait two months after his interview to blow his brains out? And 21 months after he would&#x2019;ve tried to beat a little girl to death? And there&#x2019;s this: Why would he leave a seven-page suicide letter, the details of which Maillaud will not release?</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.t">Maybe he was just a depressed old soldier with seven pages of reasons. There&#x2019;s still nothing tangible, or even reliably speculative, that puts Menegaldo on that mountain at that time.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.u">So Maillaud is no further along on the third anniversary than he was at the second or the &#xFB01;rst. Perhaps he truly is in the presence of a perfect crime.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.v">He considers this. Afternoon sun pours through his windows, glints off the lake, carves shadows on the mountains. Annecy is beautiful in the early spring.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.w">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like,&#x201D; he says after a moment, &#x201C;perfect crimes.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.x"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.y">There was one final angle. It popped up in July 2014, about the time reporters would have been preparing stories about the second anniversary of an unsolved quadruple homicide. It didn&#x2019;t get a lot of attention beyond the &#xFB01;rst day or two, and maybe it didn&#x2019;t deserve to. But here it is:</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.z">Seven hours after the murders in the Alps, a man named James Thompson told a friend he felt nauseated. He asked for some aspirin, left an antiques shop he ran in Natchez, Mississippi, U.S.A., and climbed into his truck.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.10">Thompson was a former cop and an oil-&#xFB01;eld worker. He also was divorced, amicably, from an Iraqi dentist he married in 1999, apparently as a favor. They split up a few months later. She moved to England, where she met an engineer named Saad al-Hilli. They courted for three months, got married, had two baby girls who were now 4 and 7. They vacationed in a white B&#xFC;rstner camper towed behind Saad&#x2019;s maroon BMW, the last time to the shore of a cold, clear lake high in the mountains of eastern France.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.11">Iqbal al-Hilli kept her &#xFB01;rst marriage a secret. Not even Zaid knew, until French investigators announced it. &#x201C;She seemed to be this nice Muslim woman,&#x201D; Maillaud says now, &#x201C;and here she married an American. People have exploded families for less than that.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.12">Thompson pulled into the street. His truck veered to the right and rolled to a slow stop in the road. He had his foot on the brake, and the rest of him was slumped over the wheel. Dead.</p><p data-reactid=".1lbzrf8fcao.1.1.0.0.4.13">He was overweight, and his blood pressure was high, and he smoked cigars, and he&#x2019;d just turned 60. That James Thompson would have a massive coronary was not startling. That he would suffer one seven hours after his secret ex-wife was shot twice in the head in an unsolved crime with no motive and no suspects is almost certainly a coincidence.
