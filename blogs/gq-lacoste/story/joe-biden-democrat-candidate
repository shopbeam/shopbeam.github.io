  	    "articleBody": "In the last couple weeks, the prospects of a third Joe Biden for President campaign have gone from exceedingly long to increasingly likely. The progression started on August 1 with Maureen Dowd\u0027s bombshell revelation that, on his deathbed, Beau Biden had urged his father to run. (By the way, how great has MoDo been lately? Yes, her column often reads like frivolous fluff—or worse—in moments of crisis, but in this Trump-driven silliest of silly political seasons, she\u0027s been indispensable.) Since then, there has been a steady stream of leaks—presumably from the Biden camp—indicating that the Vice President is serious about making one last run for the White House. He\u0027s spending his vacation at a luxury resort in South Carolina sounding out friends and political allies. His closest aides are contacting key operatives in Iowa. His team is even floating trial balloons, like a potential campaign promise that he\u0027d only serve one term. On Monday morning, NBC\u0027s Chuck Todd reported that \u0022a Biden confidant\u0022 placed the odds of Biden running \u0022as high as 60%-40%.\u0022\u000A\u000APolitical reporters have greeted the prospect of Biden\u0027s late entry into the race with something that approaches unbridled glee. Politico\u0027s Jack Shafer argues that the media\u0027s giddiness over a potential Biden run has to do with its laziness—that Biden is a familiar figure whose \u0022political longevity has produced giant flumes of coverage over the years, and that coverage can be captured and reused by reporters to write new stories.\u0022 There\u0027s certainly some truth to that—and it helps explain why rumors that Mitt Romney and Al Gore would also make 2016 runs were greeted with similar enthusiasm—but there\u0027s another reason journalists are practically rooting for Biden to get in the race: It will offer them a respite from covering Hillary Clinton.\u000A\u000AJust consider the scene out in Iowa this past weekend, when Hillary visited the State Fair. Traditionally one of the great campaign stops of any presidential run—and not just because it produces endlessly entertaining pictures of various White House hopefuls standing in front of a butter cow or chomping on corn dogs—the Iowa State Fair offers a genuine, and exceedingly rare, opportunity for unscripted, unpredictable, and thus revelatory moments. (It certainly provided those for Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Trump over the last few days.) But when Clinton hit the State Fair, the unpredictability—and fun—predictably came to a screeching halt. Her stroll through the fairgrounds had all the charm and joy of a forced march. \u0022The C-SPAN footage is almost harrowing,\u0022 Buzzfeed\u0027s Ruby Cramer wrote. Clinton eschewed the opportunity to speak on the fair\u0027s soapbox—where Bush and Walker confronted their tough questions—and, instead, had fleeting conversations with various fair-goers about important issues such as berry picking and potluck dinners. After two hours at the fair, the New York Times\u0027s Amy Chozick reported, \u0022Mrs. Clinton, holding a pork chop on a stick and a giant lemonade, climbed into a sport utility vehicle that took her to a private plane destined for Martha\u0027s Vineyard.\u0022 As David Frum jokingly tweeted, \u0022That explains the pork chop that tumbled out of the sky onto an Iowa back yard.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe excuse for Clinton\u0027s inaccessibility in Iowa was, as always, her celebrity. Everywhere she goes, she\u0027s accompanied by hordes of Secret Service agents and reporters and curious onlookers. The fact that she draws such a large crowd, the theory goes, makes it virtually impossible for her to engage in any meaningful human interactions with members of that crowd—or to exhibit much in the way of humanity in general. And there is, no doubt, some truth to that argument.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestGetty Images\u000A\u000AOF COURSE, it\u0027s also just as true for Joe Biden. As the sitting vice president, he\u0027s burdened by just as much celebrity—and the accompanying Secret Service detail and reporters and curious onlookers—as Clinton. But does that ever stop Biden from doing stuff like this? Or this? Or this? It wasn\u0027t hard to watch Clinton joylessly traversing the sea of humanity in Iowa, before beating a hasty retreat to a fundraiser on the Vineyard, and long for Biden\u0027s entry. Can you imagine the mischief he\u0027d get up to at the State Fair—and the copy (and pictures) he\u0027d generate?\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s the prospect of such moments coming to the Democratic presidential primary that make reporters so eager for Biden to run. Bernie Sanders may be getting crowds, but his campaign is more likely than Trump\u0027s at this point to go bust. Martin O\u0027Malley has failed to launch. It\u0027s not clear why—or, oftentimes, even if—Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee are running. All that\u0027s left to distract us from Clinton\u0027s joyless slog to the nomination is a Biden candidacy.\u000A\u000AUnfortunately for Biden, it\u0027s not clear that anyone else shares reporters\u0027 enthusiasm. For all the furor over Hillary\u0027s emails and her sinking poll numbers, the major Democratic party players are not abandoning her. For instance, at the Vineyard fundraiser to which Hillary fled after Iowa, Politico reported, major Democratic donors remain solidly in Hillary\u0027s corner. And it\u0027s not like political operatives are looking to leave the Clinton operation for Biden either, either. Ron Klain—Biden\u0027s former chief of staff and someone Biden would presumably want in a key roll on a presidential campaign—is already doing debate prep for Clinton.\u000A\u000AIndeed, the more we learn about what a Biden presidential campaign would look like—through an increasingly steady tide of strategic leaks from people in his camp—the more and more a Biden campaign seems like shear lunacy.\u000A\u000APut aside for the moment that, save for style, there\u0027s not much to differentiate Biden from Clinton: they\u0027re only five years apart in age; they\u0027re similarly saddled with the \u0022career politician\u0022 label; and they both have about the same truck with the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party, which is to say: not much. The biggest differences between them, unfortunately for Biden, are all in Hillary\u0027s favor—namely her huge fundraising and organizational advantages.\u000A\u000AIf Biden does decide to run, he will be starting so far behind Clinton\u000Ain the staffing and fundraising games that it\u0027ll be impossible for him\u000Ato catch up.Twitter\u000A\u000AIf Biden had decided two years ago that he wanted to run for president, it\u0027s possible he could have been her equal, or at least within shouting distance of her, in both departments. But, unlike Clinton, Biden has not spent the last few years assiduously laying the groundwork for a presidential run. What\u0027s more, the few steps he tried to take in that direction were impeded by Barack Obama\u0027s political team, as Politico\u0027s Glenn Thrush has reported. If Biden does decide to run, he will be starting so far behind Clinton in the staffing and fundraising games that it\u0027ll be impossible for him to catch up.\u000A\u000AAnd then there\u0027s the matter of who would actually vote for Biden rather than Clinton. The key for a Democrat who wants to win the White House these days is to assemble what National Journal\u0027s Ron Brownstein calls \u0022the coalition of the ascendant\u0022—in other words \u0022young people, minorities and college-educated whites, especially women.\u0022 It\u0027s the coalition Obama used to win in 2008 and 2012 and what Hillary is planning to use in 2016, as her announcement video—featuring gay and interracial couples, as well as two Spanish-speaking brothers and even a barrista—made clear.\u000A\u000ABy contrast, the coalition that Biden apparently hopes to ride to victory isn\u0027t ascendant so much as diminished and marginal. As Politico reported last Friday, \u0022Biden\u0027s circle has identified what they see as their potential voting blocs: Reagan Democrats, Jews, an LGBT base that largely credits him with pushing President Barack Obama into supporting gay marriage, and Rust Belt voters.\u0022 Even if Biden were to carry those groups—and it\u0027s easy to see him facing stiff competition from Clinton, who has her own longstanding ties to all of them—it\u0027s not clear that enough of them vote in Democratic primaries, much less in a general election, for him to win.\u000A\u000AIf nothing else, Biden\u0027s ongoing flirtations with a presidential run have distracted us from the ongoing tedium of the Democratic primaries—and raised the prospect of something more exciting and actually fun. But that doesn\u0027t make for a winning presidential campaign. The two times Biden has run for the White House, his defeats were mitigated by the fact that he was playing a longer game. In 1988, he was still a young man and had future campaigns in front of him. In 2008, his longshot bid was an audition for a cabinet post or, as it turned out, the vice presidency. This time, there is no longer game. It\u0027s an all or nothing gamble. And there\u0027ll be no upside—and nothing fun—about being on the losing end.\u000A\u000AJason Zengerle is GQ\u0027s Political Correspondent",

exceedingly long to increasingly likely. The progression started on August 1 with Maureen Dowd&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/opinion/sunday/maureen-dowd-joe-biden-in-2016-what-would-beau-do.html">bombshell revelation</a> that, on his deathbed, Beau Biden had urged his father to run. (By the way, how great has MoDo been lately? Yes, her column often reads like frivolous fluff&#x2014;or <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/21/opinion/21DOWD.html">worse</a>&#x2014;in moments of crisis, but in this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/opinion/sunday/introducing-donald-trump-diplomat.html">Trump-driven</a> silliest of silly political seasons, she&#x2019;s been indispensable.) Since then, there has been a steady stream of leaks&#x2014;presumably from the Biden camp&#x2014;indicating that the Vice President is serious about making one last run for the White House. He&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-biden-is-sounding-out-allies-about-a-2016-bid-1439424303">spending his vacation</a> at a luxury resort in South Carolina sounding out friends and political allies. His closest aides are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/us/politics/joe-biden-on-beach-vacation-wades-further-into-16-bid.html">contacting key operatives</a> in Iowa. His team is <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/joe-biden-possible-2016-presidential-race-promises-one-term-121359.html">even floating trial balloons,</a> like a potential campaign promise that he&#x2019;d only serve one term. On Monday morning, NBC&#x2019;s Chuck Todd <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/one-crazy-summer-2016-reality-check-n410941?cid=eml_nfr_20150817">reported</a> that &#x201C;a Biden confidant&#x201D; placed the odds of Biden running &#x201C;as high as 60%-40%.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.1">Political reporters have greeted the prospect of Biden&#x2019;s late entry into the race with something that approaches unbridled glee. <em>Politico</em>&#x2019;s Jack Shafer <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/biden-gore-2016-bubbles-121455.html#.VdJn9It3_eK">argues</a> that the media&#x2019;s giddiness over a potential Biden run has to do with its laziness&#x2014;that Biden is a familiar figure whose &#x201C;political longevity has produced giant flumes of coverage over the years, and that coverage can be captured and reused by reporters to write new stories.&#x201D; There&#x2019;s certainly some truth to that&#x2014;and it helps explain why rumors that Mitt Romney and Al Gore would also make 2016 runs were greeted with similar enthusiasm&#x2014;but there&#x2019;s another reason journalists are practically rooting for Biden to get in the race: It will offer them a respite from covering Hillary Clinton.</p><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.2">Just consider the scene out in Iowa this past weekend, when Hillary visited the State Fair. Traditionally one of the great campaign stops of any presidential run&#x2014;and not just because it produces endlessly entertaining pictures of various White House hopefuls standing in front of a <a href="http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/af/11a8fa66305baa22f98a72b44c6efb/media:a6817225174d4432be5dd3ba90e3cefdDEM2016O&#x2019;Malley.JPEG">butter cow</a> or <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/7I95IFwxkrY/maxresdefault.jpg">chomping on corn dogs</a>&#x2014;the Iowa State Fair offers a genuine, and exceedingly rare, opportunity for unscripted, unpredictable, and thus revelatory moments. (It certainly provided those for <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/14/politics/jeb-bush-iowa-soapbox-paul-wolfowitz/">Jeb Bush</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWdAnbD20kw&amp;feature=youtu.be">Scott Walker</a>, and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/16/politics/donald-trump-iowa-state-fair/">Trump</a> over the last few days.) But when Clinton hit the State Fair, the unpredictability&#x2014;and fun&#x2014;predictably came to a screeching halt. Her stroll through the fairgrounds had all the charm and joy of a forced march. &#x201C;The C-SPAN footage is almost harrowing,&#x201D; <em>Buzzfeed</em>&#x2019;s Ruby Cramer <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/how-voters-try-fail-and-sometimes-succeed-to-talk-to-hillary">wrote</a>. Clinton eschewed the opportunity to speak on the fair&#x2019;s soapbox&#x2014;where Bush and Walker confronted their tough questions&#x2014;and, instead, had fleeting conversations with various fair-goers about important issues such as berry picking and potluck dinners. After two hours at the fair, the <em>New York Times</em>&#x2019;s Amy Chozick <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/us/politics/hillary-clinton-iowa.html?ref=politics&amp;_r=1&amp;referrer=">reported</a>, &#x201C;Mrs. Clinton, holding a pork chop on a stick and a giant lemonade, climbed into a sport utility vehicle that took her to a private plane destined for Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard.&#x201D; As David Frum jokingly <a href="https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/633283538712854528">tweeted</a>, &#x201C;That explains the pork chop that tumbled out of the sky onto an Iowa back yard.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.3">The excuse for Clinton&#x2019;s inaccessibility in Iowa was, as always, her celebrity. Everywhere she goes, she&#x2019;s accompanied by hordes of Secret Service agents and reporters and curious onlookers. The fact that she draws such a large crowd, the theory goes, makes it virtually impossible for her to engage in any meaningful human interactions with members of that crowd&#x2014;or to exhibit much in the way of humanity in general. And there is, no doubt, some truth to that argument.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.5"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55d37f16606992214f1ed26c/master/w_806/Biden Looking Down.jpg" alt="Biden Looking Down.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjoe-biden-democrat-candidate&amp;t=Biden%20Looking%20Down.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjoe-biden-democrat-candidate&amp;t=Biden%20Looking%20Down.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjoe-biden-democrat-candidate&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55d37f16606992214f1ed26c%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FBiden%20Looking%20Down.jpg&amp;description=Biden%20Looking%20Down.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjoe-biden-democrat-candidate&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55d37f16606992214f1ed26c%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FBiden%20Looking%20Down.jpg&amp;description=Biden%20Looking%20Down.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Getty Images</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.6">OF COURSE, it&apos;s also just as true for Joe Biden. As the sitting vice president, he&#x2019;s burdened by just as much celebrity&#x2014;and the accompanying Secret Service detail and reporters and curious onlookers&#x2014;as Clinton. But does that ever stop Biden from doing stuff like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/post/joe-biden-gets-cosy-with-bikers/2012/09/10/20f6f622-fb64-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_blog.html">this</a>? Or <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/biden-eats-ice-cream-upside-down-takes-selfie-with-guy-in-pot-t-shirt/">this</a>?

It wasn&#x2019;t hard to watch Clinton joylessly traversing the sea of humanity in Iowa, before beating a hasty retreat to a fundraiser on the Vineyard, and long for Biden&#x2019;s entry. Can you imagine the mischief he&#x2019;d get up to at the State Fair&#x2014;and the copy (and pictures) he&#x2019;d generate?</p><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.7">It&#x2019;s the prospect of such moments coming to the Democratic presidential primary that make reporters so eager for Biden to run. Bernie Sanders may be getting crowds, but his campaign is more likely than Trump&#x2019;s at this point to go bust. Martin O&#x2019;Malley has failed to launch. It&#x2019;s not clear why&#x2014;or, oftentimes, even if&#x2014;Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee are running. All that&#x2019;s left to distract us from Clinton&#x2019;s joyless slog to the nomination is a Biden candidacy.</p><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.8">Unfortunately for Biden, it&#x2019;s not clear that anyone else shares reporters&#x2019; enthusiasm. For all the furor over Hillary&#x2019;s emails and her sinking poll numbers, the major Democratic party players are not abandoning her. For instance, at the Vineyard fundraiser to which Hillary fled after Iowa, <em>Politico</em> <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/boxing-out-joe-biden-121413.html">reported</a>, major Democratic donors remain solidly in Hillary&#x2019;s corner. And it&#x2019;s not like political operatives are looking to leave the Clinton operation for Biden either, either. Ron Klain&#x2014;Biden&#x2019;s former chief of staff and someone Biden would presumably want in a key roll on a presidential campaign&#x2014;is already doing debate prep for Clinton.</p><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.9">Indeed, the more we learn about what a Biden presidential campaign would look like&#x2014;through an increasingly steady tide of strategic leaks from people in his camp&#x2014;the more and more a Biden campaign seems like shear lunacy.</p><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.a">Put aside for the moment that, save for style, there&#x2019;s not much to differentiate Biden from Clinton: they&#x2019;re only five years apart in age; they&#x2019;re similarly saddled with the &#x201C;career politician&#x201D; label; and they both have about the same truck with the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party, which is to say: not much. The biggest differences between them, unfortunately for Biden, are all in Hillary&#x2019;s favor&#x2014;namely her huge fundraising and organizational advantages.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.b"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>If Biden does decide to run, he will be starting so far behind Clinton

But, unlike Clinton, Biden has not spent the last few years assiduously laying the groundwork for a presidential run. What&#x2019;s more, the few steps he tried to take in that direction were impeded by Barack Obama&#x2019;s political team, as <em>Politico</em>&#x2019;s Glenn Thrush <a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/02/joe-biden-profile-103667_Page4.html#.VdIv54t3_eJ">has reported</a>. If Biden does decide to run, he will be starting so far behind Clinton in the staffing and fundraising games that it&#x2019;ll be impossible for him to catch up.</p><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.d">And then there&#x2019;s the matter of who would actually vote for Biden rather than Clinton. The key for a Democrat who wants to win the White House these days is to assemble what <em>National Journal</em>&#x2019;s Ron Brownstein <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/obama-wins-by-marrying-the-new-democratic-coalition-with-the-old-20121107">calls</a> &#x201C;the coalition of the ascendant&#x201D;&#x2014;in other words &#x201C;young people, minorities and college-educated whites, especially women.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s the coalition Obama used to win in 2008 and 2012 and what Hillary is planning to use in 2016, as her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N708P-A45D0">announcement video</a>&#x2014;featuring gay and interracial couples, as well as two Spanish-speaking brothers and even a barrista&#x2014;made clear.</p><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.e">By contrast, the coalition that Biden apparently hopes to ride to victory isn&#x2019;t ascendant so much as diminished and marginal. As <em>Politico</em> <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/biden-strategy-for-white-house-run-taking-shape-121377.html#ixzz3j6MXQhtl">reported</a> last Friday, &#x201C;Biden&#x2019;s circle has identified what they see as their potential voting blocs: Reagan Democrats, Jews, an LGBT base that largely credits him with pushing President Barack Obama into supporting gay marriage, and Rust Belt voters.&#x201D; Even if Biden were to carry those groups&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s easy to see him facing stiff competition from Clinton, who has her own longstanding ties to all of them&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not clear that enough of them vote in Democratic primaries, much less in a general election, for him to win.</p><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.f">If nothing else, Biden&#x2019;s ongoing flirtations with a presidential run have distracted us from the ongoing tedium of the Democratic primaries&#x2014;and raised the prospect of something more exciting and actually fun. But that doesn&#x2019;t make for a winning presidential campaign. The two times Biden has run for the White House, his defeats were mitigated by the fact that he was playing a longer game. In 1988, he was still a young man and had future campaigns in front of him. In 2008, his longshot bid was an audition for a cabinet post or, as it turned out, the vice presidency. This time, there is no longer game. It&#x2019;s an all or nothing gamble. And there&#x2019;ll be no upside&#x2014;and nothing fun&#x2014;about being on the losing end.</p><p data-reactid=".1migvdqel1c.1.1.0.0.4.g"><em>Jason Zengerle is</em> GQ&#x2019;s <em>Political
