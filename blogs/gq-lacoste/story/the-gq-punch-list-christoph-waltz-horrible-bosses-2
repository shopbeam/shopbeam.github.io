Because it\u0027s a fairy tale.The Pied Piper of Hamelin is the first in Brand\u0027s series of reimagined kids\u0027 stories, Trickster Tales. As you can imagine, it\u0027s funny. (Think fart jokes; think lots of fart jokes.) But there\u0027s a moral to the story too. Kind of like his new comedy standup special Messiah Complex—premiering on EPIX Friday; check out an exclusive clip of Messiah Complex below—which is as outrageously funny as it is politically relevant. We called up Brand to talk fairy tales and why they\u0027re important, heroes and why they\u0027re flawed, and Rumpelstiltskin and why Rumpelstiltskin is a dick.\u000A\u000AThe GQ+A: Russell Brand Talks Fairy Tales and Edward Snowden\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Photo: John P. Johnson\u000A\u000ALet Christoph Waltz teach you how to be a billionaire-CEO dickbag. The impish Oscar winner plays one of the horrible people in Horrible Bosses 2—a wealthy evil-investor type who takes your silly start-up idea to become an even wealthier evil-investor type. (He sets this trap for the movie\u0027s still clueless, newly entrepreneurial lead trio.) Here, Waltz shares six ways he learned to harness his inner Sean Parker.\u000A\u000A Give good talk. \u0022The really rich, really mean investor is a sweet-talker. Suave and smooth, so people don\u0027t get it—that\u0027s what makes him mean. Otherwise, he\u0027d just be a regular rich investor.\u0022\u000A\u000A At a business lunch, don\u0027t order the $200 puffer fish. \u0022Stick to the odd steak every once in a while. Don\u0027t be ostentatious with food, like a Russian gas-field owner. That\u0027s more KGB.\u0022\u000A\u000A But do purchase douchey toys. \u0022There\u0027s a yacht in Cannes—$40,000 just to turn it on, not to go anywhere. What\u0027s a year of college versus turning on an engine?\u0022\u000A\u000A Enlist some allies to be your muscle. \u0022Buy the Republican Party and have them do whatever you want.\u0022\u000A\u000A Be modest and humble at all times. \u0022Think that you are God. And always right. So there\u0027s no role model—you are the role model.\u0022\u000A\u000A And if caught, just play dumb. \u0022How do you cheat at golf?!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A…And then learn more from the actor about bringing that dickbag to life on-screen. In this outtake from our conversation with Waltz for GQ\u0027s November issue.\u000A\u000AGQ: How different is it, for you, working on a comedy versus drama?\u000A\u000A Christoph Waltz: They\u0027re not, really, that much different. And why should they be? Whether they\u0027re funny or not is the result, and it\u0027s not necessarily the result of what I do alone. I just play the part as it\u0027s written, and if it\u0027s funny, it might turn out to be funny in the movie. But funny is always a combination of many, many things. It\u0027s like a little clockwork, where nothing can be missing and if one thing ticks the wrong way, then the whole thing doesn\u0027t come together. For a movie to be funny requires a lot of very smart people. Real comedy requires an immense amount of know-how and experience and musicality and expertise and craft and all that.\u000A\u000AWhat about playing the bad guy?\u000A\u000A Every role is different. If it\u0027s a good role, it\u0027s a good role. Whether you think it\u0027s a villain or a rich, mean investor or a nice guy or a lover boy, that\u0027s up to you. You know, that tells more about you than about the part.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Photo: &amp;#xA9;2014 Causeway Films\u000A\u000AScare yourself out of your post-Thanksgiving food coma with The Babadook. The holiday weekend just got a whole lot scarier than Black Friday thanks to The Babadook, a.k.a. the movie that will wake you from your food coma and never let you sleep again. This little Australian indie, by filmmaker Jennifer Kent, is massively scary: A widowed mom, whose grief gets in the way of loving her cute but totally creepy son, is haunted, possibly hunted, by a horrifying children\u0027s\u0027 book character that may or may not be real. It\u0027s all that uncertainty that makes it so damn scary. That, and the sound of The Babadook\u0027s voice. And his face. And all of it, really. We spoke with Kent about why we\u0027re so terrified.\u000A\u000AThe GQ+A: The Babadook\u0027s Jennifer Kent On The Scariest Movie You\u0027ll See All Year\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AListen to the Song of Summer…again. Iggy Azalea\u0027s new album, Reclassified, drops Monday. Well, it\u0027shalf of a new album. Five brand new tracks accompany a repackaged track list from her previous album, The New Classic. It will, of course, include \u0022Fancy.\u0022 But you know what? It\u0027s cold out. So why not bring on the song that we couldn\u0027t get out of our heads all summer long to help get us through the #polarvortexsnowmageddonbigchill, right? OK—here\u0027s Weird Al\u0027s version.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWatch The Imitation Game and become a certified Cumberbro: You may not know this, but sometime in the past few years, your girlfriend has crossed [insert whatever People\u0027s \u0022Sexiest Man Alive\u0022 dude here] off her freebie list and lustily scratched Benedict Cumberbatch\u0027s name in its place. Why? Because for three seasons, he\u0027s been making women everywhere his Cumberbitches (their own affectionate coinage, which apparently makes Cumberbatch wince, he\u0027s that much of a mensch) with his turn as the deep, honey-voiced sleuth on Sherlock. (Haven\u0027t you ever wondered why your Netflix keeps recommending soft-core murder mysteries?) And he\u0027s been following it up with a string of performances as loveable weirdo-geniuses—even making Julian Assange seem huggable—ever since. But this week, it\u0027s your turn to finally get on the Cumberbandwagon. As British cryptologist Alan Turning, who helped crack the Nazi\u0027s un-crackable Enigma Code in World War II only to be later persecuted for being gay, Cumberbatch\u0027s performance is somehow prickly, eccentric, and oddly charismatic all at once. It\u0027s enough to make you consider adding him to yourfreebie list—or at least your Oscar ballot.—NOJAN AMINOSHAREI\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Photo: Al Messershmidt/Getty Images\u000A\u000AChoose the lesser (or just less blood-related) of two evils. It hasn\u0027t exactly been a banner year for football, we\u0027ll readily acknowledge. The league looks ugly from just about every angle—players, owners, and the commish most of all. Thing is, when you\u0027re stuck at home on Thanksgiving, even the reflexively militant black hole that is the NFL can seem preferable to another \u0022WHAT ABOUT #BENGHAZI\u0022 shout-a-thon with your craziest uncle. So when you realize that Cowboys-Eagles, a game with fairly massive playoff implications for both teams, kicks off at 4:30pm EST, well, we won\u0027t judge you for doing a little moral calculus.—SAM SCHUBE\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHappy Thanksgiving!

Why? Because for three seasons, he&#x2019;s been making women everywhere his Cumberbitches (their own affectionate coinage, which apparently makes Cumberbatch wince, he&#x2019;s <em>that</em> much of a mensch) with his turn as the deep, honey-voiced sleuth on <em>Sherlock</em>. (Haven&#x2019;t you ever wondered why your Netflix keeps recommending soft-core murder mysteries?) And he&#x2019;s been following it up with a string of performances as loveable weirdo-geniuses&#x2014;even making Julian Assange seem huggable&#x2014;ever since. But this week, it&#x2019;s your turn to finally get on the Cumberbandwagon. As British cryptologist Alan Turning, who helped crack the Nazi&#x2019;s un-crackable Enigma Code in World War II only to be later persecuted for being gay, Cumberbatch&#x2019;s performance is somehow prickly, eccentric, and oddly charismatic all at once. It&#x2019;s enough to make you consider adding him to <em>your</em>freebie list&#x2014;or at least your Oscar ballot.&#x2014;NOJAN AMINOSHAREI</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".1uzxgomesxs.1.1.0.0.4.11"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/S5CjKEFb-sM" height="315" width="560"></iframe></div></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1uzxgomesxs.1.1.0.0.4.12"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1uzxgomesxs.1.1.0.0.4.13"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55828d741177d66d68d53284/master/w_806/blogs-the-feed-gq-punch-list-08.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-gq-punch-list-08.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-gq-punch-list-christoph-waltz-horrible-bosses-2&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-gq-punch-list-08.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-gq-punch-list-christoph-waltz-horrible-bosses-2&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-gq-punch-list-08.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-gq-punch-list-christoph-waltz-horrible-bosses-2&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828d741177d66d68d53284%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-gq-punch-list-08.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-gq-punch-list-08.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-gq-punch-list-christoph-waltz-horrible-bosses-2&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828d741177d66d68d53284%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-gq-punch-list-08.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-gq-punch-list-08.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1uzxgomesxs.1.1.0.0.4.14"> Photo: Al Messershmidt/Getty Images</p><p data-reactid=".1uzxgomesxs.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>Choose the lesser (or just less blood-related) of two evils. </strong>It hasn&#x2019;t exactly been a banner year for football, we&#x2019;ll readily acknowledge. The league looks ugly from just about every angle&#x2014;players, owners, and the commish most of all.
