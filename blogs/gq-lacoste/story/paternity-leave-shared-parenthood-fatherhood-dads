  	    "description": "Paid parental leave is becoming a hot-button issue among presidential candidates, and here\u0027s why you should join the discussion",
  	    "articleBody": "Paid leave was a hot topic in the first Democratic debate, with Senator Bernie Sanders calling the U.S.\u0027s nonexistent federal paid-leave policy an \u0022international embarrassment\u0022 and Hillary Clinton recalling being a working mom with a sick baby. \u0022I know what it is like,\u0022 she said. \u0022And I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents have, particularly working moms.\u0022 Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin O\u0027Malley also sympathized with mothers, which is great—aside from the fact that they missed the whole other half of parenting: the dads.\u000A\u000AIn order for women to ever have a fair shake in the workplace—I\u0027m looking at you, gender wage gap—paid leave needs to be viewed as crucial for women and men. This is something that should make sense by now, and if candidates looked at millennial fathers for a hot second, they might get it, too. These are men who, in addition to doing the bulk of the grocery shopping and dazzling you with their \u002790s-inspired Spotify baby playlist (think Weezer on a banjo), are now becoming familiar faces in the fight for paid leave. It\u0027s a battle women have waged, mostly on our own—don\u0027t sweat it, guys; happy to have you—for years. And like a wish granted from a diaper genie, men are starting to step up. Too bad most of the candidates haven\u0027t noticed.\u000A\u000A\u0022These days, the badge of honor comes from being a dad who takes leave and who is an equal partner,\u0022 says Jacob Feinspan, 35, an advocate in Washington, D.C., and father of two. To be fair, the average age of the Democratic candidates on stage at the first debate is 65, and it\u0027s millennial fathers leading the charge for paid leave, fueled by a shift in social norms Boomer dads might struggle to understand. The pressure men feel is real: Eighty-eight percent of fathers in their 20s and 30s say it\u0027s important to be a \u0022perfect dad,\u0022 outnumbering the 78 percent of moms who feel the same way. And in order to be this A+ father, it\u0027s reasonable to assume that men, you know, want to be around when their children are born and need policies that enable them to do so.\u000A\u000AAccording to Brad Harrington, Ph.D., the executive director of the Boston College Center for Work and Family and a leading expert on fatherhood, the cultural shift of dads wanting to be more involved—including taking time off to be with their families—has gained momentum over the past five years, which is also when the oldest millennials entered their 30s. Roughly 80 percent of today\u0027s new dads were raised in the 1980s and \u002790s, a time when the number of working women grew to more than 57 percent of the female population, making a two-income household the norm. In college, these same men were (and are) outpaced by women, who earn more bachelor\u0027s, master\u0027s, and doctoral degrees. By the time they are ready to have a family, \u0022these guys fully expect that their wives are going to have jobs, that they will probably work full-time, and may not be able to take off for long periods of time,\u0022 Harrington says. The result is a groundswell of men fighting for their right to parental-leave policies.\u000A\u000AThe momentum behind men advocating for paid leave is at least partly boosted by the smarter, sexier makeover fatherhood has received from the media (including our own magazine and website) over the past few years—a change that Harrington says was reflected in the 2015 Super Bowl ads like this one from Dove, and further evidenced by the emergence of \u0022daddy bloggers,\u0022 a community that\u0027s grown so much in both size and power that it has its own summit. Josh Levs, a journalist, father of three, and author, benefited from the support of that community when he was denied paid parental leave by his employer in 2013, fought it, and won. (The company ultimately changed its corporate policy after Levs\u0027s case garnered national attention, but it was never forced legally.) \u0022As soon as I announced the legal action, support came in from so many people and groups—women\u0027s and men\u0027s groups, mom and dad blogs, people on the left and right, business leaders, people across the political spectrum,\u0022 he says. Now Levs, 43, has more than 40,000 Twitter followers, and recently wrote the book All In, a call to action for working dads that he hopes will do for them at home what Lean In did for women in the office.\u000A\u000AUnfortunately, they\u0027re in for a long slog. New dads are facing outdated social stigmas, judgment from older bosses and CEOs, and arguments from Republican lawmakers that paid leave will hurt small businesses. Sure, there are companies like Facebook and Netflix offering generous paid leave to fathers—17 weeks and up to one year, respectively—but this is hardly the norm in the U.S. As it stands, the Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees only 12 weeks of unpaid leave for eligible workers, making the United States the only industrialized nation without paid maternity leave, and trailing behind the 70 countries that offer paid leave to fathers. Also defeating: Only 13 percent of men in the U.S. who take leave receive pay, and seven out of ten new dads take ten days of leave or less, according to the Department of Labor. The whole \u0022paid\u0022 part is kind of a big deal for any successful plan forward; when companies do offer paid time off, most guys will take the maximum number of days offered, says Harrington. But first, paid leave has to be an actual, real-life option, and new dads are pushing for just that.\u000A\u000AJust ask Feinspan, who took four weeks off work and two months of half workdays when his wife gave birth to their son. \u0022I saw how personally meaningful it was to be at home with my son,\u0022 he says. \u0022I also saw other friends who weren\u0027t able to be home, and the routine ended up being that the wife became confident [as a parent] and the dad just never did.\u0022 When Feinspan became the executive director of the activist organization Jews United for Justice, he created a paid-family-leave program for all of his employees. He also helped launch what\u0027s an ongoing paid-family-leave campaign in Washington, D.C., so that other new parents can hopefully one day reap the same benefits as his employees.\u000A\u000AWant to join the fight? Here\u0027s how you can get involved…\u000A\u000APolitically: Contact local elected officials, show up at town hall meetings, or join organizations like Family Values @ Work, A Better Balance, or the Make It Work campaign, which are advocating for better paid-leave policies for men and women.  \u000A\u000AWhere employers are progressing, lawmakers, for the most part—and don\u0027t be shocked now—are failing. There are exceptions: California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island offer paid leave to workers in the private sector, Boston recently signed an ordinance for up to six weeks\u0027 paid parental leave for city employees, and last year government employees in Washington, D.C., received up to eight weeks\u0027 paid leave to care for a newborn, adopted child, or parent.\u000A\u000AA national solution is still unlikely for the time being, although paid leave is sure to remain a major issue in the upcoming election. \u0022The polls are overwhelming on this,\u0022 says Ellen Bravo, executive director of Family Values @ Work, a nonpartisan network advocating for family-friendly workplace policies. \u0022There is such high support across the political spectrum and across all demographics. It would be very difficult for whoever else is in the race not to address it.\u0022\u000A\u000AFeinspan and other advocates are counting on an increased awareness to help move paid leave ahead. There is hope: As Feinspan continues to fight for better policies for all workers in Washington, D.C., he says he has noticed a recent shift when talking to elected leaders about the issue. \u0022What\u0027s been surprising is how intensely interested and supportive basically every elected leader and every staff person that I speak with about [paid leave is], they get it,\u0022 he says. \u0022They\u0027re having kids…they know this is important for everybody.\u0022 Logistically, offering paid leave is easier for a company than it is for a city or state—companies set up their own policies, but lawmakers have to create an insurance program that people buy into, he says. But there is hope: \u0022You certainly are seeing more political leaders speaking out proactively on this issue,\u0022 Feinspan notes. \u0022Paid leave is no longer seen as just a women\u0027s issue.\u0022\u000A\u000ATo help men push for better leave policies where they currently work—or jump ship to a company that already offers paid time off—the website Fatherly released a report of the 50 best places to work for new dads. \u0022The report was created in part as a way to continue to support the movement of paid leave and policies that affect working parents,\u0022 says Simon Isaacs, a co-founder of the site, who recently turned 35…and became a dad himself. According to Isaacs, this is the first report of its kind in the U.S.—and while men can use it to highlight what other companies are doing to support new dads when advocating for themselves at the office, hopefully it will be a wake-up call for businesses, too. \u0022Highlighting how highly successful companies like Facebook, Google, and Bank of America are supporting new dads will hopefully spur others to adopt similar programs.\u0022\u000A\u000AProfessionally: Talk to HR about your company\u0027s parental-leave policy—and if it doesn\u0027t have one, discuss its importance, no matter your sex.\u000A\u000ACorporations vying for talent are responding to men\u0027s demands for more family-friendly work policies. Which is exactly what they should be doing considering that 89 percent of dads say it\u0027s important for employers to provide paid parental leave. Even older businesses are playing ball: Johnson &amp; Johnson bumped its paid parental leave up from one week to nine in May, Goldman Sachs recently doubled paid leave for non-primary caregivers, and PwC now offers six weeks\u0027 paid parental leave for women and men. \u0022Businesses are not looking at this to be nice,\u0022 says Scott Behson, Ph.D, a professor of management at Fairleigh Dickinson University and the author of the new book The Working Dad\u0027s Survival Guide. \u0022In industries where there is a war for talent, where it\u0027s competitive to hire the best people and hold on to the best people, companies are starting to see things like paid leave as a way to distinguish themselves.\u0022\u000A\u000ASocially: Start a group for working dads, whether it\u0027s casually swapping baby stories over beers or properly organized by HR, to share common challenges with fellow fathers.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARelated:\u0022Ryan Reynolds Shows How to Embrace Your Dad Years\u0022\u0022This Is Happening: The GQ Guide to Becoming a Father\u0022\u002210 Celebrity Dads We Love—and One We Don\u0027t\u0022",

data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.0">Paid leave was a hot topic in the first Democratic debate, with Senator Bernie Sanders calling the U.S.&#x2019;s nonexistent federal paid-leave policy an &#x201C;international embarrassment&#x201D; and Hillary Clinton recalling being a working mom with a sick baby. &#x201C;I know what it is like,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;And I think we need to recognize the incredible challenges that so many parents have, particularly working moms.&#x201D; Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin O&#x2019;Malley also sympathized with mothers, which is great&#x2014;aside from the fact that they missed the whole other half of parenting: the dads.</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.1">In order for women to ever have a fair shake in the workplace&#x2014;I&#x2019;m looking at you, gender wage gap&#x2014;paid leave needs to be viewed as crucial for women <em>and</em> men. This is something that should <em>make sense</em> by now, and if candidates looked at <a href="http://www.gq.com/gallery/how-to-dress-like-a-hot-dad">millennial fathers</a> for a hot second, they might get it, too. These are men who, in addition to doing the bulk of the <a href="http://reports.mintel.com/display/590654/?__cc=1">grocery shopping</a> and dazzling you with their &#x2019;90s-inspired Spotify baby playlist (think Weezer on a banjo), are now becoming familiar faces in the fight for paid leave. It&apos;s a battle women have waged, mostly on our own&#x2014;don&#x2019;t sweat it, guys; happy to have you&#x2014;for years. And like a wish granted from a <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/bullshit-baby-products">diaper genie</a>, men are starting to step up. Too bad most of the candidates haven&#x2019;t noticed.</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#x201C;These days, the badge of honor comes from being a dad who takes leave and who is an equal partner,&#x201D; says Jacob Feinspan, 35, an advocate in Washington, D.C., and father of two. To be fair, the average age of the Democratic candidates on stage at the first debate is 65, and it&#x2019;s <em>millennial</em> fathers leading the charge for paid leave, fueled by a shift in social norms Boomer dads might struggle to understand. The pressure men feel is real: Eighty-eight percent of fathers in their 20s and 30s say it&#x2019;s important to be a &#x201C;perfect dad,&#x201D; outnumbering the <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/millennial-dads-turn-to-digital-in-moments-of-need.html">78 percent of moms who feel the same way</a>. And in order to be this A+ father, it&#x2019;s reasonable to assume that men, you know, <em>want to be around</em> when their children are born and need policies that enable them to do so.</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.3">According to Brad Harrington, Ph.D., the executive director of the Boston College Center for Work and Family and a leading expert on fatherhood, the cultural shift of dads wanting to be more involved&#x2014;including taking time off to be with their families&#x2014;has gained momentum over the past five years, which is also when the oldest millennials entered their 30s. <a href="http://www.millennialmarketing.com/2013/07/new-research-the-millennial-generation-becomes-parents/">Roughly 80 percent of today&#x2019;s new dads were raised in the 1980s and &#x2019;90s, a time</a> when the number of working women grew to more than 57 percent of the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/cps/womenlaborforce_2013.pdf">female population</a>, making a two-income household the norm. In college, these same men were (and are) outpaced by women, who earn more <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d14/tables/dt14_318.30.asp">bachelor&#x2019;s, master&#x2019;s, and doctoral degrees</a>. By the time they are ready to have a family, &#x201C;these guys fully expect that their wives are going to have jobs, that they will probably work full-time, and may not be able to take off for long periods of time,&#x201D; Harrington says. The result is a groundswell of men fighting for their right to parental-leave policies.</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.5">The momentum behind men advocating for paid leave is at least partly boosted by the smarter, sexier makeover <a href="../dad">fatherhood</a> has received from the media (including our own magazine and website) over the past few years&#x2014;a change that Harrington says was reflected in the <a href="http://time.com/3674706/super-bowl-ad-dads-dove/">2015 Super Bowl ads like this one</a> from Dove, and further evidenced by the emergence of &#x201C;daddy bloggers,&#x201D; a community that&#x2019;s grown so much in both size and power that it has its own <a href="http://www.dad2summit.com">summit</a>. <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/career/a37189/guys-want-it-all-too/">Josh Levs</a>, a journalist, father of three, and author, benefited from the support of that community when he was denied paid parental leave by his employer in 2013, fought it, and won. (The company ultimately changed its corporate policy after Levs&#x2019;s case garnered national attention, but it was never forced legally.) &#x201C;As soon as I announced the legal action, support came in from so many people and groups&#x2014;women&#x2019;s and men&#x2019;s groups, mom and dad blogs, people on the left and right, business leaders, people across the political spectrum,&#x201D; he says. Now Levs, 43, has more than 40,000 Twitter followers, and recently wrote the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/All-In-Work-First-Families-Businesses-And/dp/0062349619"><em>All In</em></a>, a call to action for working dads that he hopes will do for them at home what <em>Lean In</em> did for women in the office.</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.6">Unfortunately, they&#x2019;re in for a long slog. New dads are facing outdated social stigmas, judgment from older bosses and CEOs, and arguments from Republican lawmakers that paid leave will hurt small businesses. Sure, there are companies like Facebook and Netflix offering generous paid leave to fathers&#x2014;17 weeks and up to one year, respectively&#x2014;but this is hardly the norm in the U.S. As it stands, the Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees only 12 weeks of unpaid leave for eligible workers, making the United States the only industrialized nation without paid maternity leave, and trailing behind the <a href="http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/documents/publication/wcms_242617.pdf">70 countries that offer paid leave to fathers</a>. Also defeating: Only 13 percent of men in the U.S. who take leave receive pay, and seven out of ten new dads take ten days of leave or less, according to the <a href="http://www.dol.gov/asp/policy-development/PaternityBrief.pdf">Department of Labor</a>. The whole &#x201C;paid&#x201D; part is kind of a big deal for any successful plan forward; when companies do offer paid time off, most guys will take the maximum number of days offered, says Harrington. But first, paid leave has to be an actual, real-life option, and new dads are pushing for just that.</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.7">Just ask Feinspan, who took four weeks off work and two months of half workdays when his wife gave birth to their son. &#x201C;I saw how personally meaningful it was to be at home with my son,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I also saw other friends who weren&#x2019;t able to be home, and the routine ended up being that the wife became confident [as a parent] and the dad just never did.&#x201D; When Feinspan became the executive director of the activist organization Jews United for Justice, he created a paid-family-leave program for all of his employees. He also helped launch what&#x2019;s an ongoing paid-family-leave campaign in Washington, D.C., so that other new parents can hopefully one day reap the same benefits as his employees.</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.8">Want to join the fight? Here&#x2019;s how you can get involved&#x2026;</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>Politically: <a href="http://salsa4.salsalabs.com/o/51069/p/salsa/web/common/public/signup?signup_page_KEY=7728">Contact local elected officials, show up at town hall meetings, or join organizations like Family Values @ Work</a>, <a href="http://www.abetterbalance.org/web/takeaction">A Better Balance</a>, or the <a href="http://action.makeitworkcampaign.org/page/s/the-make-it-work-pledge?utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=nav&amp;source=nav">Make It Work campaign</a>, which are advocating for better paid-leave policies for men and women.</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.a">Where employers are progressing, lawmakers, for the most part&#x2014;and don&#x2019;t be shocked now&#x2014;are failing. There are exceptions: California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island offer paid leave to workers in the private sector, Boston recently signed an ordinance for up to six weeks&#x2019; paid parental leave for city employees, and last year government employees in Washington, D.C., received up to eight weeks&#x2019; paid leave to care for a newborn, adopted child, or parent.</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.b">A national solution is still unlikely for the time being, although paid leave is sure to remain a major issue in the upcoming election. &#x201C;The polls are overwhelming on this,&#x201D; says Ellen Bravo, executive director of Family Values @ Work, a nonpartisan network advocating for family-friendly workplace policies. &#x201C;There is such high support across the political spectrum and across all demographics. It would be very difficult for whoever else is in the race not to address it.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.c">Feinspan and other advocates are counting on an increased awareness to help move paid leave ahead. There is hope: As Feinspan continues to fight for better policies for all workers in Washington, D.C., he says he has noticed a recent shift when talking to elected leaders about the issue. &#x201C;What&#x2019;s been surprising is how intensely interested and supportive basically every elected leader and every staff person that I speak with about [paid leave is], they get it,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re having kids&#x2026;they know this is important for everybody.&#x201D; Logistically, offering paid leave is easier for a company than it is for a city or state&#x2014;companies set up their own policies, but lawmakers have to create an insurance program that people buy into, he says. But there is hope: &#x201C;You certainly are seeing more political leaders speaking out proactively on this issue,&#x201D; Feinspan notes. &#x201C;Paid leave is no longer seen as just a women&#x2019;s issue.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.d">To help men push for better leave policies where they currently work&#x2014;or jump ship to a company that already offers paid time off&#x2014;the website <a href="https://www.fatherly.com/">Fatherly</a> released a report of the <a href="https://www.fatherly.com/50-best-places-to-work-for-new-dads-the-complete-list-1114921020.html">50 best places to work for new dads</a>. &#x201C;The report was created in part as a way to continue to support the movement of paid leave and policies that affect working parents,&#x201D; says Simon Isaacs, a co-founder of the site, who recently turned 35&#x2026;and became a dad himself. According to Isaacs, this is the first report of its kind in the U.S.&#x2014;and while men can use it to highlight what other companies are doing to support new dads when advocating for themselves at the office, hopefully it will be a wake-up call for businesses, too. &#x201C;Highlighting how highly successful companies like Facebook, Google, and Bank of America are supporting new dads will hopefully spur others to adopt similar programs.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Professionally: Talk to HR about your company&#x2019;s parental-leave policy&#x2014;and if it doesn&apos;t have one, discuss its importance, no matter your sex.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".18tag2668sg.1.1.0.0.4.f">Corporations vying for talent are responding to men&#x2019;s demands for more family-friendly work policies. <a href="http://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/centers/cwf/news/pdf/BCCWF%20The%20New%20Dad%202014%20FINAL.pdf">Which is exactly what they <em>should</em> be doing considering that 89 percent of dads</a> say it&#x2019;s important for employers to provide paid parental leave. Even older businesses are playing ball: Johnson &amp; Johnson bumped its paid parental leave up from one week to nine in May, Goldman Sachs recently doubled paid leave for non-primary caregivers, and PwC now offers six weeks&#x2019; paid parental leave for women <em>and</em> men. &#x201C;Businesses are not looking at this to be nice,&#x201D; says Scott Behson, Ph.D, a professor of management at Fairleigh Dickinson University and the author of the new book <em>The Working Dad&#x2019;s Survival Guide</em>. &#x201C;In industries where there is a war for talent, where it&#x2019;s competitive to
