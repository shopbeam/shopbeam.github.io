  	    "articleBody": "The Big House, when empty, rises on all sides in limestone gray, like the machine-carved rock walls of a Midwestern quarry; on game days, the sold-out stadium—a hundred rows high, 110,000 fans in maize and blue—becomes the fourth-largest city in the state of Michigan. Here on the field this last official day of spring, 230 high school quarterbacks tune in to a former quarterback and current head coach in a block-M ball cap and a pair of slack khakis, extra-wide. This is Jim Harbaugh, and this is his dominion.\u000A\u000A\u0022Can everybody hear me?!\u0022 he booms, welcoming these kids to his super-cool backyard. \u0022I\u0027ve got a good coach\u0027s voice, so I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll need a microphone!\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s true. And everyone\u0027s been listening. Not just at this summer camp, but ever since his return to Ann Arbor after Christmas. The situation is very nearly unprecedented: a football coach with as much delirious success as Harbaugh—he turned around two NCAA programs (San Diego and Stanford) and then led the San Francisco 49ers to three straight NFC Championship games—heading back to college by choice.\u000A\u000ABut to question Harbaugh\u0027s move is to misunderstand the institutional and personal forces at work. Jim\u0027s dad, Jack, was an assistant under the legendary Michigan coach Bo Schembechler; Jim was a ball boy, a regular ﬁxture on the sideline and in the locker room, and ultimately a three-year starting quarterback for Bo and the Wolverines in the mid-\u002780s. Jim is, then, a pre-programmed, deep-faith zealot—the only coach who might make this radical shift look like a step up.\u000A\u000AThe Harbaugh signing—even in the depths of an all-time bleak streak (Michigan was 5-7 last year, zero Big Ten titles in a decade)—immediately inspired, in the Michigan faithful, a sense that everything was going to be okay. \u0022I swear there\u0027s been more unbridled irrational exuberance over Harbaugh\u0027s arrival than there was in 1997–98 over a national title,\u0022 says John U. Bacon, author of Endzone: The Rise, Fall, and Return of Michigan Football.\u000A\u000AThis day, at the quarterback camp, is a day without pads or helmets—typical QB drills, but also some unorthodox, creatively competitive skill stations. Catching and throwing baseballs (\u0022Hit your cut-off man!\u0022), scrambling for dodge balls, one-v-one races through a bounce house.\u000A\u000A\u0022There\u0027s a leaderboard up there,\u0022 Harbaugh says, pointing toward the pair of 4,000-square-foot LED video screens above each end zone. \u0022It\u0027s a competition day. Hopefully that doesn\u0027t offend anybody. That this\u0027ll be a competitive environment. Hope that\u0027s okay. \u0027Cause if it\u0027s not—guess what? You\u0027re playing the wrong position. You\u0027re literally playing the wrong position!\u0022\u000A\u000AIf you take Jim\u0027s father, Jack, at his word, nobody in the history of American competition—\u0022maybe besides Muhammad Ali\u0022—is as great a competitor as Jim Harbaugh. (It\u0027s worth noting here that Jim\u0027s brother, John, is the Super Bowl–winning head coach of the Baltimore Ravens.) Nobody loves football as much as Jim Harbaugh, either. And finally—and here\u0027s why we\u0027re at the Big House today and not an NFL training facility in Buffalo or Oakland—nobody loves the University of Michigan as much as Jim Harbaugh.\u000A\u000A\u0022You can tell I\u0027m pretty darn excited to be out here today,\u0022 he says, unnecessarily. \u0022I was in this camp when I was in seventh grade!\u0022\u000A\u000AHarbaugh is big and balanced. His six-foot-three frame cuts a larger, more defined shape out of the air than even those dimensions would suggest. It\u0027s his stance—wide hips, wide feet, wide enough that you\u0027d know what shoes he was wearing if you were using the bathroom stall next to his. He spends much of the speech stretching—\u0022I\u0027ve got a little hamstring I\u0027m working through today\u0022—and practicing his QB footwork and throwing motion.\u000A\u000AHe plays catch with campers. Oversees the timed sprint around the pylons—on occasion lifting kids into the first row of the stands when they look like they\u0027re gonna puke (an anywhere-but-on-my-field gesture of half-measure generosity) and piggy-backing them down onto the sideline again when they\u0027re recovered. And dishes with the dozen-plus current and former pro QBs he\u0027s invited to Ann Arbor—Ken Dorsey and Greg McElroy and Jay Cutler, who\u0027s wearing Wayfarers and fiddling with his bedhead.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s a day of football,\u0022 he says. \u0022Just quarterbacks. And competition... Maybe you\u0027ll even beat me. I hope you beat me! Maybe you\u0027ll even beat Jay Cutler!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Doubtful,\u0022 Cutler honks from the edge of the field, a C student in the back row of math class.\u000A\u000A\u0022All right!\u0022 Harbaugh shouts. \u0022I love it!\u0022\u000A\u000AFor Harbaugh, football is a greater gift to mankind than fire. Which is why he says it, his battle cry, now and all day at camp, just as he will all season, win or lose. To players, parents, coaches, and pros.\u000A\u000AThe question, and Harbaugh screams it, is this: \u0022Who\u0027s got it better than us?!\u0022\u000A\u000AEveryone seems to know the answer in their hearts, even if they\u0027ve never said it aloud before. And so they respond resoundingly: \u0022NOBODY!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A@CoachJim4UM: Attacking this day with Enthusiasm Unknown to Mankind3:44 a.m. – 15 Jan 2015\u000A\u000AThis quarterback camp is a day of competition, yes, but it is also a day for small talk. Harbaugh glad-hands with each and every parent who wishes to say hello. He smiles constantly—his lower lip slung with dip, stretching a wide smile wider. He takes his hat off to meet women. He nods through the timeless old-man exuberances that must exist on every Big Ten campus year-round.\u000A\u000A\u0022Mr. Michigan!\u0022 a man from the class of 19-O-something says.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah...that\u0027s what they say...\u0022 Harbaugh says, a rare crack of modesty crawling across his face.\u000A\u000ABut then the lights dial up again when he meets the father of a boy who\u0027s out on the field.\u000A\u000A\u0022How\u0027s your boy doing?!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Good, good,\u0022 the man says.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, where\u0027s he at in the standings?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Um,\u0022 the man says, apparently not glued to the JumboTron. \u0022I\u0027m...I\u0027m not sure, Coach.\u0022\u000A\u000AHarbaugh invites parents in for a talk from Grandpa Jack. It\u0027s difficult to get a bead on Jim without paying extra special attention to Jack. He is the progenitor, obviously. But he is also the blueprint for Jim\u0027s energy and enthusiasm, his uncompromised vision. In so many ways, Jim is the full actualization of Jack—the version Jack couldn\u0027t quite attain himself during his years as merely a very good assistant.\u000A\u000A\u0022Good to be here!\u0022 Jack says, moving like a windup toy that\u0027s just been fully cranked. \u0022Good to be anywhere at my age!\u0022\u000A\u000AJack tells stories about Jim as a boy. He tells boxing stories where he screams \u0022Boom!\u0022 and \u0022Bang!\u0022 and demonstrates combinations and feints with such devotion that he loses his breath. (When he yells, Jack sounds like Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet.)\u000A\u000A\u0022Life is so simple! Jim mentioned today the ABCs\u0022—Jim had described his foolproof system of teaching his six kids to ride a bicycle; the ABCs of bike riding could make a better quarterback, too, evidently. \u0022Well, I have another one! ACE. A-C-E. Attitude. Competitiveness. Enthusiasm. When you ace a test...ACE. Fighter pilots, these guys who fly over countries shooting bullets, if he\u0027s the best, he\u0027s called...the ace. He\u0027s the best. If you shoot a hole in one in golf, that\u0027s called an...ace. Can\u0027t do any better than that! So that word, ace...\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022The best pitcher on a baseball team!\u0022 someone shouts. Heads turn to see what kid has interrupted. Turns out it\u0027s Jim, on the edge of his seat in the third row.\u000A\u000A\u0022Thank you, Jim! The ace right-hander or left-hander, he\u0027s called the...ace of the pitching staff!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022The highest card in a deck!\u0022 Jim shouts again.\u000A\u000A\u0022Ace!! There\u0027s another one!! It\u0027s almost as though we\u0027ve done this before. So there\u0027s those three letters: Attitude Competitiveness Enthusiasm. A-C-E. And I don\u0027t know of anybody in my life that more epitomizes those three letters than Jim Harbaugh.\u0022\u000A\u000AJack tells another Jim story: During the August two-a-day\u0027s between Jim\u0027s sophomore and junior years at Michigan, Jim was searching for a competitive advantage, a way to stand out to Coach Schembechler and hold on to that starting job. Between the morning and late-afternoon practices, players would shower off and take a ﬁve-hour break. Jim had always done this, too. But one day, he tried something new: What if instead of hitting the showers, he changed into running shorts and pounded a few miles on the streets of Ann Arbor? Anything for an edge.\u000A\u000AI know Jack tells this story to motivate young players toward their greatest selves, but all I can think of is The Right Stuff—specifically that part when the seven would-be astronauts moved down to Cocoa Beach, Florida. After ten or twelve hours of training each day, six of the seven would take a load off, drink beers around the pool, cool down with the space bunnies. Everyone except John Glenn—who would go for an extra run on the beach instead. It\u0027s made clear just how much Glenn\u0027s above-and-beyond hero shit rubbed his confreres the wrong way. As it must\u0027ve with some of Harbaugh\u0027s teammates and reportedly has with some of his players—especially the pros. (Just imagine what it must be like to be a ten-year vet, an adult male, forced to sit through the rah-rah messaging meant for soft-clay teenagers.) But just as Glenn emerged as the savior America craved in the moment, the return of Harbaugh—in the bleakest hour of Michigan\u0027s bleakest month—is the symbolic equivalent of a space shot.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A@CoachJim4UM: Life at Michigan is Great! Great with a capital \u0022G\u0022!12:58 p.m. – 14 Jan 2015\u000A\u000AAll winter, while Harbaugh was living out of the Residence Inn near the Briarwood Mall, and on into spring, he was doing real things to transfigure the program, but also doing his part to serve as the symbol, too. That representative Jim Myth about the two-a-days is just one drop in the deep bucket of Jim Myths that play well with recruits, young players, and especially fans. Behold the varied ways—calculated and inadvertent—Jim Harbaugh spent his winter, spring, and summer making supporters feel comforted by and giddy with his presence on the sideline. Here was this coach whose blog-baiting recruiting tactics (he asked a kid to Michigan the same way the kid asked his date to prom), popularity among undergrads (in March, he finished fourth as a write-in candidate for student-body president), provocations with other coaches (he ran a series of \u0022satellite\u0022 football camps in enemy territory—Alabama, Texas, Florida, California), dadbod-ﬂaunting (he was photographed on the skins squad of a pickup game), ox-in-a-china-shop swagger through France (he played catch on the streets of the Île Saint-Louis during a brief getaway to Paris), and even highway heroics (he aided a woman who\u0027d crashed on I-94) established him as not merely the sculptor of a turnaround but its mascot, too. \u0022He was like Forrest Gump,\u0022 Bacon says, \u0022popping up everywhere you looked... That guy got more attention for taking his shirt off than probably a supermodel would. At this point, we\u0027re not dealing with a rational situation.\u0022\u000A\u000AHere was someone to feel good about and to laugh along with. Harbaugh paraphernalia began appearing at the M Den, the giant University of Michigan apparel outposts on campus. (One shirt: \u0022Maize. Blue. Khaki.\u0022)  And places like MGoBlog, the wildly influential independent Michigan sports site, began silk-screening shirts of their own. (\u0022Satellites: Not Just For Space.\u0022)\u000A\u000A\u0022It doesn\u0027t make any sense, but it suddenly felt like everything was gonna be all right,\u0022 says Brian Cook, the founder and editor of MGoBlog. That after the roughest season in decades, \u0022the football team was going to be okay. But also that my baby was going to be okay. It was a far more powerful feeling than it should be for something like football. Having this guy who just walks in the room and it\u0027s like the sun—he has all this energy, and he wants to give it to you.\u0022 Much of the faith was derived from the fact that people saw in Coach Harbaugh an embodiment of everything they\u0027d been sold about the university and the football program since they, like Cook, were kids. \u0022Right away, in that very first presser, he makes a reference that\u0027s a fallback to Bo. And Michigan is still hung up on Bo, will always be hung up on Bo, in a way that he\u0027s even more outsized than I think you would expect.\u0022 What they saw in Jim, in other words, was the second coming of Bo.\u000A\u000ADon\u0027t sweat it if you don\u0027t know much about Bo. Though he stalked the Michigan sideline for twenty-one years (\u002769–\u002789) and thirteen Big Ten titles, he never actually won a national championship. But his brand of competitive enthusiasm, along with his patented visual signifiers—an ever-present pair of aviators and the very same style of block-M hat Harbaugh wears now—cemented a feeling of oneness with the program and the fans and the town that have outlived him. Jim played for Bo and Jack coached under him, and there is no one Jim has ever admired more. (\u0022Bo Schembechler is about [as] next to the word of God as you can get, in my mind,\u0022 he has said.) News of Bo\u0027s death (in 2006), it\u0027s been said elsewhere, was the first time Jim\u0027s wife had ever heard him cry. And when Jim decided to finally pull the trigger and buy a house in Ann Arbor this spring, he picked one on Bo\u0027s block.\u000A\u000AAll of which is to say there is deeply layered nostalgia at play whenever Jim Harbaugh speaks about Michigan football. If you X-Acto-knife his words out of their context, you could pretty much rubber cement them into any decade in the past sixty years. And though it\u0027s fully the case when Jim speaks, it\u0027s never more evident than when Jack gets going.\u000A\u000AWhen Jack\u0027s talking to the parents in June, he hits a little tangent about the roles of fathers and mothers in their boys\u0027 lives. It\u0027s not a misogynistic monologue. It\u0027s just radically old-fashioned. Dad gets to play with the boys while mom keeps the ship sailing. It is Rockwellian. (And Schembechlerian.) It could be then, or it could be now—it sort of doesn\u0027t matter, because this is Michigan football, and the Michigan football that Michigan football fans most want to believe in is one that is historical and traditional and timeless. (Michigan won ten of its eleven national titles before 1949.) And this is what Jim seems to want most: to stretch back generationally to the football he grew up with, to the football his father grew up with—to save that, to preserve that.\u000A\u000ABut this isn\u0027t the first half of the twentieth century. It\u0027s fucking 2015. There is not one old-fashioned thing about big-time college football except for the lyrics to the fight songs (and, in the case of Michigan, the all-white 1974 throwback uniforms they\u0027ll wear on the road this season). Jim Harbaugh will make $40 million in seven seasons. His offensive and defensive coordinators make just shy of a million each. Players are being recruited in middle school—a \u0022game of musical chairs\u0022 Jim says he resents, but God damn if he isn\u0027t going to compete if that\u0027s where the competition\u0027s heading. (He even hands out an offer to a rising high school sophomore after the QB camp.) All at once, Jim\u0027s playing a game in which he\u0027s steeped in the past but also obligated to lead the charge into the future, as very possibly the most influential coach in the entire game of football, professional or amateur. \u0022It\u0027s like simultaneous Sandlot and Rollerball,\u0022 Cook says.\u000A\u000AAnd yet, for all the legitimate promise and whipped air of positive attitudes, there\u0027s still this cold saw blade that bites against the good feelings, one thing that\u0027s difficult to reconcile with the rosy future. And that is the fact that Jim Harbaugh believes deeply in hits. Though he cares first and foremost about his quarterback, he was \u0022not a pocket dancer by trade,\u0022 Bacon reminds me, during his playing days—four years at Michigan followed by fifteen seasons in the NFL. He took his licks like an American man. (\u0022[Football] is the last bastion of hope for toughness in America in men,\u0022 he said, controversially, this spring.) Harbaugh believes in a smash-mouth line of scrimmage, an aggressive pro-style offense that attacks defenses nose-on. He believes in football that is composed of all the elements that are making people flee football. And yet it\u0027s possible to proceed unbothered by this fact when the school and town (\u0022Ann Arbaugh\u0022) pledge support to the program. It\u0027s a beautiful bubble, a warm bath (well, not that warm—it\u0027s the Upper Midwest) of clear purpose.\u000A\u000ABut what if Harbaugh, the ultimate true believer, is also the person who is most capable of wrestling football out of its crisis moment—the concussions, the unrelenting brutality on the field and off, the creeping sense that the game itself, in its current form, is morally unsustainable. If it were Jim Harbaugh who developed the enlightened view on football\u0027s future—\u0022What he says now about football,\u0022 Cook says, \u0022is that it\u0027s worth it\u0022—who began preaching on its behalf instead of merely leaving it to advocates on the outside of the game looking in, it might have outsize influence. That is: It\u0027s not Harbaugh\u0027s prerogative to develop the vaccine, but he\u0027s certainly capable of hosting the telethon.\u000A\u000AThis is a coach, I genuinely believe, who possesses that special frequency of an upstart political candidate. A candidate who people recognize to be separate from the pack and capable of an effectiveness we all know, deep down, no political candidate actually is. But in that season before they take office—as during the season before actual football games have to be played and won—we can envision such candidates in fantastic scenarios in which true saving gets done.\u000A\u000ASo let me break the rules here and speak directly—football-admiring constituent to elected rep:\u000A\u000ACoach: Without significant revision, football will not exist at the end of your life, no matter how hard you will it—and, by God, you will it hard. You have the opportunity to save the sport you love, by leading a way out, that looks not back to Bo\u0027s game but into a future of \u0022pure football\u0022 in the ontological, if not skull-cracking, sense of the phrase. This, not winning, is your truest charge. And if you lead Michigan to a national championship in the process, I guess that\u0027s cool, too.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A@CoachJim4UM: Ppl say I\u0027m crazy doing what I\u0027m doing, give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin When I say I\u0027m OK they look at me kind of strange7:54 p.m. – 8 Jun 2015\u000A\u000AThis week, as the Wolverines prepare for Thursday evening\u0027s opener with Utah, the version of Jim Harbaugh we\u0027ve all grown acquainted with in 2015—post-election, pre-inauguration, pure hope—will be knotted off like a balloon and cast into the collective past. And the business of winning will supersede everything else. (As will the business of losing—the truer test of Harbaugh\u0027s depthless enthusiasm.) But I have to wonder how much more time Harbaugh will be given than your average coach (the Wolverines\u0027 fourth head coach in nine years). How much more \u0022rope he\u0027ll get,\u0022 as Cook puts it.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s difficult—and meaningless in football, really—to project a coach too far into the future when everyone knows the job is week-to-week. But that\u0027s sort of the point of Harbaugh. Past, present, future—all at once. It\u0027s what everyone\u0027s done from minute one, from well before his hiring was even possible, and it\u0027s what they\u0027ll do no matter the results versus Utah on Thursday, or Michigan State and Ohio State later this season. And it\u0027s the thinking I\u0027m doing now about that built-in, blood-level willfulness—that push to dream and make it so—that\u0027s thrusting me right back to campus.\u000A\u000AAt the end of the QB camp in June, I watched Jim and Jack rush to Jim\u0027s truck—in a hurry to wrap up and meet Jim\u0027s little waist-high towheads, who were in from California for Father\u0027s Day. Jim hopped into his Michigan-blue F-150 Platinum, parked in a pretty decent but not great spot in the shadow of the Big House, and revved up. As he started to pull out and away, Jack still wasn\u0027t in the truck, so he did this little Indiana Jones leap into the cab before slamming the door. And as I watched them together, I started playing this thing through my head that Jack had said earlier.\u000A\u000AJack had been talking not long before about this sign that used to hang in the Michigan locker room, maybe back in the \u002770s, Bo\u0027s era. It said: WHAT YOU VIVIDLY IMAGINE, ARDENTLY BELIEVE, AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY ACT UPON WILL INEVITABLY COME TO PASS. As far as those things go, that\u0027s a pretty good proto-cat poster. And goddamn if that isn\u0027t Jim Harbaugh. A man raised on and of the spiritual wisdom of locker-room signs.\u000A\u000AThe imagination part, though—Jack seized on the \u0022vividly imagine.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022This,\u0022 Jack said, gesturing at Jim, \u0022was the all-time daydreamer. Sometimes we\u0027d get a call from class: Jim is staring out the window, he\u0027s a daydreamer. And I\u0027d say: ‘THANK GOD HE\u0027S A DAYDREAMER!\u0027 Don\u0027t we love daydreamers?! That\u0027s where everything in our world starts—somebody looking out the window and daydreaming. He was daydreaming about someday being the quarterback at the University of Michigan. He was thinking about someday growing to six feet three, because of all the milk he could drink, to be an NFL quarterback. And that\u0027s where he came to the great line: ‘I\u0027m gonna play until they tell me I can\u0027t\u0027—which was fifteen years—‘and I\u0027m gonna coach until I die.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AGrandpa Jack looked Jim in the eyes across the room: \u0022Just don\u0027t rush it! Take your time!\u0022",

Here on the field this last official day of spring, 230 high school quarterbacks tune in to a former quarterback and current head coach in a block-M ball cap and a pair of slack khakis, extra-wide. This is Jim Harbaugh, and this is his dominion.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1">&quot;Can everybody <em>hear me?!</em>&quot; he booms, welcoming these kids to his super-cool backyard. &quot;I&apos;ve got a good coach&apos;s voice, so I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll need a microphone!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.2">It&apos;s true. And everyone&apos;s been listening. Not just at this summer camp, but ever since his return to Ann Arbor after Christmas. The situation is very nearly unprecedented: a football coach with as much delirious success as Harbaugh&#x2014;he turned around two NCAA programs (San Diego and Stanford) and then led the San Francisco 49ers to three straight NFC Championship games&#x2014;heading back to college by choice.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.3">But to question Harbaugh&apos;s move is to misunderstand the institutional and personal forces at work. Jim&apos;s dad, Jack, was an assistant under the legendary Michigan coach Bo Schembechler; Jim was a ball boy, a regular &#xFB01;xture on the sideline and in the locker room, and ultimately a three-year starting quarterback for Bo and the Wolverines in the mid-&#x2019;80s. Jim is, then, a pre-programmed, deep-faith zealot&#x2014;the only coach who might make this radical shift look like a step up.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.5">The Harbaugh signing&#x2014;even in the depths of an all-time bleak streak (Michigan was 5-7 last year, zero Big Ten titles in a decade)&#x2014;immediately inspired, in the Michigan faithful, a sense that everything was going to be okay. &quot;I swear there&apos;s been more unbridled irrational exuberance over Harbaugh&apos;s arrival than there was in 1997&#x2013;98 over a national title,&quot; says John U. Bacon, author of <em>Endzone: The Rise, Fall, and Return of Michigan Football.</em></p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.6">This day, at the quarterback camp, is a day without pads or helmets&#x2014;typical QB drills, but also some unorthodox, creatively competitive skill stations. Catching and throwing baseballs (&quot;Hit your cut-off man!&quot;), scrambling for dodge balls, one-v-one races through a bounce house.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.7">&quot;There&apos;s a leaderboard up there,&quot; Harbaugh says, pointing toward the pair of 4,000-square-foot LED video screens above each end zone. &quot;It&apos;s a competition day. Hopefully that doesn&apos;t offend anybody. That this&apos;ll be a competitive environment. Hope that&apos;s okay. &#x2019;Cause if it&apos;s <em>not&#x2014;</em>guess what? You&apos;re playing the wrong position. You&apos;re <em>literally playing the wrong position!</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.8">If you take Jim&apos;s father, Jack, at his word, nobody in the history of American competition&#x2014;&quot;maybe besides Muhammad Ali&quot;&#x2014;is as great a competitor as Jim Harbaugh. (It&apos;s worth noting here that Jim&apos;s brother, John, is the Super Bowl&#x2013;winning head coach of the Baltimore Ravens.) Nobody loves football as much as Jim Harbaugh, either. And finally&#x2014;and here&apos;s why we&apos;re at the Big House today and not an NFL training facility in Buffalo or Oakland&#x2014;nobody loves the University of Michigan as much as Jim Harbaugh.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.9">&quot;You can tell I&apos;m pretty darn excited to be out here today,&quot; he says, unnecessarily. &quot;I was in this camp when I was in seventh grade!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.a">Harbaugh is big and balanced. His six-foot-three frame cuts a larger, more defined shape out of the air than even those dimensions would suggest. It&apos;s his stance&#x2014;wide hips, wide feet, wide enough that you&apos;d know what shoes he was wearing if you were using the bathroom stall next to his. He spends much of the speech stretching&#x2014;&quot;I&apos;ve got a little hamstring I&apos;m working through today&quot;&#x2014;and practicing his QB footwork and throwing motion.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.b">He plays catch with campers. Oversees the timed sprint around the pylons&#x2014;on occasion lifting kids into the first row of the stands when they look like they&apos;re gonna puke (an anywhere-but-on-my-field gesture of half-measure generosity) and piggy-backing them down onto the sideline again when they&apos;re recovered. And dishes with the dozen-plus current and former pro QBs he&apos;s invited to Ann Arbor&#x2014;Ken Dorsey and Greg McElroy and Jay Cutler, who&apos;s wearing Wayfarers and fiddling with his bedhead.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.c">&quot;It&apos;s a day of football,&quot; he says. &quot;Just quarterbacks. And competition... Maybe you&apos;ll even beat me. I <em>hope</em> you beat me! Maybe you&apos;ll even beat Jay Cutler!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.d">&quot;Doubtful,&quot; Cutler honks from the edge of the field, a C student in the back row of math class.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.e">&quot;All right!&quot; Harbaugh shouts. &quot;I love it!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.f">For Harbaugh, football is a greater gift to mankind than fire. Which is why he says it, his battle cry, now and all day at camp, just as he will all season, win or lose. To players, parents, coaches, and pros.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.g">The question, and Harbaugh screams it, is this: &quot;<em>Who&apos;s got it better than us?!</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.h">Everyone seems to know the answer in their hearts, even if they&apos;ve never said it aloud before. And so they respond resoundingly: &quot;NOBODY!&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.i"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.j">@CoachJim4UM: Attacking this day with Enthusiasm Unknown to Mankind<br>3:44 a.m. &#x2013; 15 Jan 2015</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.k">This quarterback camp is a day of competition, yes, but it is also a day for small talk. Harbaugh glad-hands with each and every parent who wishes to say hello. He smiles constantly&#x2014;his lower lip slung with dip, stretching a wide smile wider. He takes his hat off to meet women. He nods through the timeless old-man exuberances that must exist on every Big Ten campus year-round.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.l">&quot;Mr. Michigan!&quot; a man from the class of 19-O-something says.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.m">&quot;Yeah...that&apos;s what they say...&quot; Harbaugh says, a rare crack of modesty crawling across his face.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.n">But then the lights dial up again when he meets the father of a boy who&apos;s out on the field.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.o">&quot;How&apos;s your boy doing?!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.p">&quot;Good, good,&quot; the man says.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.q">&quot;Well, where&apos;s he at in the standings?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.r">&quot;Um,&quot; the man says, apparently not glued to the JumboTron. &quot;I&apos;m...I&apos;m not sure, Coach.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.s">Harbaugh invites parents in for a talk from Grandpa Jack. It&apos;s difficult to get a bead on Jim without paying extra special attention to Jack. He is the progenitor, obviously. But he is also the blueprint for Jim&apos;s energy and enthusiasm, his uncompromised vision. In so many ways, Jim is the full actualization of Jack&#x2014;the version Jack couldn&apos;t quite attain himself during his years as merely a very good assistant.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.t">&quot;Good to be here!&quot; Jack says, moving like a windup toy that&apos;s just been fully cranked. &quot;Good to be anywhere at my age!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.u">Jack tells stories about Jim as a boy. He tells boxing stories where he screams &quot;Boom!&quot; and &quot;Bang!&quot; and demonstrates combinations and feints with such devotion that he loses his breath. (When he yells, Jack sounds like Dennis Hopper in <em>Blue Velvet</em>.)</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.v">&quot;Life is so simple! Jim mentioned today the ABCs&quot;&#x2014;Jim had described his foolproof system of teaching his six kids to ride a bicycle; the ABCs of bike riding could make a better quarterback, too, evidently. &quot;Well, I have another one! ACE. A-C-E. Attitude. Competitiveness. Enthusiasm. When you <em>ace</em> a test<em>...</em>ACE. Fighter pilots, these guys who fly over countries shooting bullets, if he&apos;s the best, he&apos;s called...<em>the ace</em>.

There&apos;s another one!! It&apos;s almost as though we&apos;ve done this before. So there&apos;s those three letters: Attitude Competitiveness Enthusiasm. A-C-E. And I don&apos;t know of anybody in my life that more epitomizes those three letters than Jim Harbaugh.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.10">Jack tells another Jim story: During the August two-a-day&apos;s between Jim&apos;s sophomore and junior years at Michigan, Jim was searching for a competitive advantage, a way to stand out to Coach Schembechler and hold on to that starting job. Between the morning and late-afternoon practices, players would shower off and take a &#xFB01;ve-hour break. Jim had always done this, too. But one day, he tried something new: What if instead of hitting the showers, he changed into running shorts and pounded a few miles on the streets of Ann Arbor? Anything for an edge.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.11">I know Jack tells this story to motivate young players toward their greatest selves, but all I can think of is <em>The Right Stuff</em>&#x2014;specifically that part when the seven would-be astronauts moved down to Cocoa Beach, Florida. After ten or twelve hours of training each day, six of the seven would take a load off, drink beers around the pool, cool down with the space bunnies. Everyone except John Glenn&#x2014;who would go for an extra run on the beach instead. It&apos;s made clear just how much Glenn&apos;s above-and-beyond hero shit rubbed his confreres the wrong way. As it must&apos;ve with some of Harbaugh&apos;s teammates and reportedly has with some of his players&#x2014;especially the pros. (Just imagine what it must be like to be a ten-year vet, an adult male, forced to sit through the rah-rah messaging meant for soft-clay teenagers.) But just as Glenn emerged as the savior America craved in the moment, the return of Harbaugh&#x2014;in the bleakest hour of Michigan&apos;s bleakest month&#x2014;is the symbolic equivalent of a space shot.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.12"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.13">@CoachJim4UM: Life at Michigan is Great!

That representative Jim Myth about the two-a-days is just one drop in the deep bucket of Jim Myths that play well with recruits, young players, and especially fans. Behold the varied ways&#x2014;calculated and inadvertent&#x2014;Jim Harbaugh spent his winter, spring, and summer making supporters feel comforted by and giddy with his presence on the sideline. Here was this coach whose blog-baiting recruiting tactics (he asked a kid to Michigan the same way the kid asked his date to prom), popularity among undergrads (in March, he finished fourth as a write-in candidate for student-body president), provocations with other coaches (he ran a series of &quot;satellite&quot; football camps in enemy territory&#x2014;Alabama, Texas, Florida, California), dadbod-&#xFB02;aunting (he was photographed on the skins squad of a pickup game), ox-in-a-china-shop swagger through France (he played catch on the streets of the &#xCE;le Saint-Louis during a brief getaway to Paris), and even highway heroics (he aided a woman who&apos;d crashed on I-94) established him as not merely the sculptor of a turnaround but its mascot, too. &quot;He was like Forrest Gump,&quot; Bacon says, &quot;popping up everywhere you looked... That guy got more attention for taking his shirt off than probably a supermodel would. At this point, we&#x2019;re not dealing with a rational situation.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.15">Here was someone to feel good about and to laugh along with. Harbaugh paraphernalia began appearing at the M Den, the giant University of Michigan apparel outposts on campus. (One shirt: &quot;Maize. Blue. Khaki.&quot;)  And places like MGoBlog, the wildly influential independent Michigan sports site, began silk-screening shirts of their own. (&quot;Satellites: Not Just For Space.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.16">&quot;It doesn&apos;t make any sense, but it suddenly felt like everything was gonna be all right,&#x201D; says Brian Cook, the founder and editor of MGoBlog. That after the roughest season in decades, &quot;the football team was going to be okay. But also that my <em>baby</em> was going to be okay. It was a far more powerful feeling than it should be for something like football. Having this guy who just walks in the room and it&#x2019;s like the sun&#x2014;he has all this energy, and he wants to give it to you.&#x201D; Much of the faith was derived from the fact that people saw in Coach Harbaugh an embodiment of everything they&apos;d been sold about the university and the football program since they, like Cook, were kids. &#x201C;Right away, in that very first presser, he makes a reference that&#x2019;s a fallback to Bo. And Michigan is still hung up on Bo, will always be hung up on Bo, in a way that he&#x2019;s even more outsized than I think you would expect.&#x201D; What they saw in Jim, in other words, was the second coming of Bo.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.17">Don&apos;t sweat it if you don&apos;t know much about Bo. Though he stalked the Michigan sideline for twenty-one years (&#x2019;69&#x2013;&#x2019;89) and thirteen Big Ten titles, he never actually won a national championship. But his brand of competitive enthusiasm, along with his patented visual signifiers&#x2014;an ever-present pair of aviators and the very same style of block-M hat Harbaugh wears now&#x2014;cemented a feeling of oneness with the program and the fans and the town that have outlived him. Jim played for Bo and Jack coached under him, and there is no one Jim has ever admired more. (&quot;Bo Schembechler is about [as] next to the word of God as you can get, in my mind,&quot; he has said.) News of Bo&apos;s death (in 2006), it&apos;s been said elsewhere, was the first time Jim&apos;s wife had ever heard him cry. And when Jim decided to finally pull the trigger and buy a house in Ann Arbor this spring, he picked one on <em>Bo&#x2019;s block</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.18">All of which is to say there is deeply layered nostalgia at play whenever Jim Harbaugh speaks about Michigan football. If you X-Acto-knife his words out of their context, you could pretty much rubber cement them into any decade in the past sixty years. And though it&apos;s fully the case when Jim speaks, it&apos;s never more evident than when Jack gets going.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.19">When Jack&apos;s talking to the parents in June, he hits a little tangent about the roles of fathers and mothers in their boys&apos; lives. It&apos;s not a misogynistic monologue. It&apos;s just radically old-fashioned. Dad gets to play with the boys while mom keeps the ship sailing. It is Rockwellian. (And Schembechlerian.) It could be then, or it could be now&#x2014;it sort of doesn&apos;t matter, because this is Michigan football, and the Michigan football that Michigan football fans most want to believe in is one that is historical and traditional and timeless. (Michigan won ten of its eleven national titles before 1949.) And this is what Jim seems to want most: to stretch back generationally to the football he grew up with, to the football his father grew up with&#x2014;to save <em>that,</em> to preserve <em>that.</em></p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1a">But this <em>isn&apos;t</em> the first half of the twentieth century. It&apos;s fucking 2015. There is not one old-fashioned thing about big-time college football except for the lyrics to the fight songs (and, in the case of Michigan, the all-white 1974 throwback uniforms they&apos;ll wear on the road this season). Jim Harbaugh will make <em>$40 million</em> in seven seasons. His offensive and defensive coordinators make just shy of a million each<em>.</em> Players are being recruited in middle school&#x2014;a &quot;game of musical chairs&quot; Jim says he resents, but God damn if he isn&apos;t going to compete if that&apos;s where the competition&apos;s heading. (He even hands out an offer to a rising high school sophomore after the QB camp.) All at once, Jim&apos;s playing a game in which he&apos;s steeped in the past but also obligated to lead the charge into the future, as very possibly the most influential coach in the entire game of football, professional or amateur. &quot;It&apos;s like simultaneous <em>Sandlot</em> and <em>Rollerball</em>,&quot; Cook says.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1b">And yet, for all the legitimate promise and whipped air of positive attitudes, there&apos;s still this cold saw blade that bites against the good feelings, one thing that&apos;s difficult to reconcile with the rosy future. And that is the fact that Jim Harbaugh believes deeply in hits. Though he cares first and foremost about his quarterback, he was &quot;not a pocket dancer by trade,&quot; Bacon reminds me, during his playing days&#x2014;four years at Michigan followed by fifteen seasons in the NFL. He took his licks like an American man. (&quot;[Football] is the last bastion of hope for toughness in America in men,&quot; he said, controversially, this spring.) Harbaugh believes in a smash-mouth line of scrimmage, an aggressive pro-style offense that attacks defenses nose-on. He believes in football that is composed of all the elements that are making people flee football. And yet it&apos;s possible to proceed unbothered by this fact when the school and town (&quot;Ann Arbaugh&quot;) pledge support to the program. It&apos;s a beautiful bubble, a warm bath (well, not that warm&#x2014;it&apos;s the Upper Midwest) of clear purpose.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1c">But what if Harbaugh, the ultimate true believer, is also the person who is most capable of wrestling football out of its crisis moment&#x2014;the concussions, the unrelenting brutality on the field and off, the creeping sense that the game itself, in its current form, is morally unsustainable. If it were Jim Harbaugh who developed the enlightened view on football&apos;s future&#x2014;&#x201C;What he says now about football,&#x201D; Cook says, &#x201C;is that it&#x2019;s worth it&#x201D;&#x2014;who began preaching on its behalf instead of merely leaving it to advocates on the outside of the game looking in, it might have outsize influence. That is: It&apos;s not Harbaugh&apos;s prerogative to develop the vaccine, but he&apos;s certainly capable of hosting the telethon.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1d">This is a coach, I genuinely believe, who possesses that special frequency of an upstart political candidate. A candidate who people recognize to be separate from the pack and capable of an effectiveness we all know, deep down, no political candidate actually is. But in that season before they take office&#x2014;as during the season before actual football games have to be played and won&#x2014;we can envision such candidates in fantastic scenarios in which true saving gets done.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1e">So let me break the rules here and speak directly&#x2014;football-admiring constituent to elected rep:</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><em>Coach: Without significant revision, football will not exist at the end of your life, no matter how hard you will it&#x2014;and, by God, you will it hard. You have the opportunity to save the sport you love, by leading a way out, that looks not back to Bo&apos;s game but into a future of &quot;pure football&quot; in the ontological, if not skull-cracking, sense of the phrase. This, not winning, is your truest charge. And if you lead Michigan to a national championship in the process, I guess that&apos;s cool, too.</em></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1h">@CoachJim4UM: Ppl say I&#x2019;m crazy doing what I&#x2019;m doing, give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin When I say I&#x2019;m OK they look at me kind of strange<br>7:54 p.m. &#x2013; 8 Jun 2015</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1i">This week, as the Wolverines prepare for Thursday evening&apos;s opener with Utah, the version of Jim Harbaugh we&apos;ve all grown acquainted with in 2015&#x2014;post-election, pre-inauguration, pure hope&#x2014;will be knotted off like a balloon and cast into the collective past. And the business of winning will supersede everything else. (As will the business of losing&#x2014;the truer test of Harbaugh&apos;s depthless enthusiasm.) But I have to wonder how much more time Harbaugh will be given than your average coach (the Wolverines&apos; fourth head coach in nine years). How much more &quot;rope he&apos;ll get,&quot; as Cook puts it.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1j">It&apos;s difficult&#x2014;and meaningless in football, really&#x2014;to project a coach too far into the future when everyone knows the job is week-to-week. But that&apos;s sort of the point of Harbaugh. Past, present, future&#x2014;all at once. It&apos;s what everyone&apos;s done from minute one, from well before his hiring was even possible, and it&apos;s what they&apos;ll do no matter the results versus Utah on Thursday, or Michigan State and Ohio State later this season. And it&apos;s the thinking I&apos;m doing now about that built-in, blood-level willfulness&#x2014;that push to dream and make it so&#x2014;that&apos;s thrusting me right back to campus.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1k">At the end of the QB camp in June, I watched Jim and Jack rush to Jim&apos;s truck&#x2014;in a hurry to wrap up and meet Jim&apos;s little waist-high towheads, who were in from California for Father&apos;s Day. Jim hopped into his Michigan-blue F-150 Platinum, parked in a pretty decent but not <em>great</em> spot in the shadow of the Big House, and revved up. As he started to pull out and away, Jack still wasn&apos;t in the truck, so he did this little Indiana Jones leap into the cab before slamming the door. And as I watched them together, I started playing this thing through my head that Jack had said earlier.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1l">Jack had been talking not long before about this sign that used to hang in the Michigan locker room, maybe back in the &#x2019;70s, Bo&apos;s era. It said: WHAT YOU VIVIDLY IMAGINE, ARDENTLY BELIEVE, AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY ACT UPON WILL INEVITABLY COME TO PASS. As far as those things go, that&apos;s a pretty good proto-cat poster. And goddamn if that isn&apos;t Jim Harbaugh. A man raised on and of the spiritual wisdom of locker-room signs.</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1m">The imagination part, though&#x2014;Jack seized on the &quot;vividly imagine.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1n">&#x201C;This,&#x201D; Jack said, gesturing at Jim, &#x201C;was the all-time daydreamer. Sometimes we&#x2019;d get a call from class: Jim is staring out the window, he&#x2019;s a daydreamer. And I&#x2019;d say: &#x2018;THANK GOD HE&#x2019;S A DAYDREAMER!&#x2019; Don&#x2019;t we love daydreamers?! That&apos;s where everything in our world starts&#x2014;somebody looking out the window and daydreaming. He was daydreaming about someday being the quarterback at the University of Michigan. He was thinking about someday growing to six feet three, because of all the milk he could drink, to be an NFL quarterback. And that&apos;s where he came to the great line: &#x2018;I&apos;m gonna play until they tell me I can&#x2019;t&#x2019;&#x2014;which was fifteen years&#x2014;&#x2018;and I&#x2019;m gonna coach until I die.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".2gk7w9rpzpc.1.1.0.0.4.1o">Grandpa Jack looked Jim in the eyes across the room: &#x201C;Just don&#x2019;t rush it!
