  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestPhoto: Dana Linberg\u000A\u000AFrom Ashy to Classy\u000A\u000AThe first album released by Bad Boy Entertainment—twenty years ago this month—was the Notorious B.I.G.\u0027s Ready to Die, an instant classic and possibly the most influential rap record ever made. For Sean \u0022Puff Daddy\u0022 Combs, the label\u0027s founder, it was the first in a remarkable streak of commercial hits: twenty-one straight gold- or platinum-selling albums, including Puff\u0027s own Grammy-winning debut, No Way Out, plus home-grown artists like Faith Evans, the Lox, Mase, Total, and 112. By the mid-1990s, Bad Boy was the biggest label in pop music. This is the story of how it all began.\u000A\u000AJadakiss (rapper, the Lox): Getting on Bad Boy was like being the top pick in the draft, going to play with the Bulls when Mike was there. It put the battery in our back.\u000A\u000AJanelle Mon&amp;#xE1;e (singer, Bad Boy artist): Bad Boy was proof that the American Dream was real for hardworking young black artists in the \u002790s, just like it had been real for Berry Gordy and all my soul and funk heroes at Motown in the \u002760s and \u002770s. When I graduated high school, I headed straight to New York. That\u0027s where Broadway was. That\u0027s where Puff was.\u000A\u000ARussell Simmons (co-founder of Def Jam): Everything Puffy touched was golden. He just made hit after hit after hit.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Ernie Paniciolli\u000A\u000ASean \u0022Puff Daddy\u0022 Combs: I remember waking up one day and I had six of the Top 10 records. As a producer, I had taken over the charts. Everybody wanted a piece of that Bad Boy sound.\u000A\u000AGabrielle Union (actress): Every jam was like, \u0022Aaawww, shit.\u0022 Y\u0027know, one hand covering your face, the other in the air.\u000A\u000AAndre Harrell (founder of Uptown Records, Combs\u0027s mentor): Puff was a great groovemaker, and whoever controls the groove controls the attitude.\u000A\u000ACheo Coker (journalist, Notorious screenwriter): Ready to Die is one of the first records to tell the perspective of the street-corner drug dealer that wasn\u0027t all fantasy and gloss. It wasn\u0027t kingpin, Scarface-type stuff. It was similar to what Richard Price did with Clockers. But Biggie didn\u0027t take 500 pages. He took an hour of your time, and you could dance to it.\u000A\u000AJessica Rosenblum (party promoter): We could be anywhere—in Palladium or a club in D.C.—Puffy always walked around with a bottle in his hand. Biggie had a bottle. They understood the fantasy. When Bad Boy first started doing videos with mansions and all that, nobody was actually living that way yet. It was a projection of what was to come. Bad Boy sold a dream.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022This Guy\u0027s Not Normal. He\u0027s Special.\u0022\u000A\u000ASean Combs was born in Harlem, and after earning a rep as a party promoter at Howard University in the late 1980s, he landed an internship at Uptown Records, where he helped the label\u0027s founder, Andre Harrell, popularize a new R&amp;B sound known as New Jack Swing. (Think: Control-era Janet Jackson, early Bobby Brown.) Almost immediately Combs proved he was capable of being more than just an errand boy; he began developing his own artists, including Mary J. Blige, and promoting his own shows.\u000A\u000ARosenblum: I called him Tuffy for three weeks. I thought his name was Tuffy. I\u0027d already been in nightlife for several years, but somehow we became fast partners, doing events on an equal footing. People would ask, \u0022Why are you putting on this 19-year-old hip-hop kid?\u0022 And I\u0027d say, \u0022You don\u0027t understand. This guy\u0027s not normal. He\u0027s special.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Ernie Paniciolli\u000A\u000AKathy Nelson (head of MCA soundtracks): I remember going to a meeting to watch a video for one of Andre\u0027s artists. Puff was in charge of it. We\u0027re looking at the rough cut, and Puffy\u0027s got himself in the video. I was like, \u0022Oh... Okay!\u0022 [laughs] But the video was great, so who cared?\u000A\u000AIn 1991, Combs organized a concert to follow a charity basketball game at the City College of New York. But the event was oversold, causing a violent stampede when the doors opened for the show. Nine people were killed. The tragedy was national news, feeding early stereotypes about the dangers of rap, and it nearly derailed Combs\u0027s career before it began.\u000A\u000AKirk Burrowes (general manager, Bad Boy): Uptown\u0027s parent company, MCA, wanted to fire him, and he was waiting for the politicians and New York citizens to calm down, waiting on the police investigations to resolve what happened. It was a long, dragged-out thing, but Andre worked his magic. MCA gave Puff another chance.\u000A\u000ACombs: I got an opportunity one night when [mega-successful R&amp;B producer] Teddy Riley didn\u0027t show up to the studio. He had a session at Chung King, this famous studio downtown. So I said, I\u0027m just gonna utilize this time. I had this idea, which was influenced by the mixtapes of Brucie B. and Kid Capri: They would blend hip-hop beats with R&amp;B a cappellas. I took one of Jodeci\u0027s a cappellas and put an EPMD beat underneath it, and it was the first record I produced: \u0022Come and Talk to Me,\u0022 the remix.\u000A\u000ACoker: Blending an R&amp;B record with a hip-hop beat seems so elementary. It seems like peanut butter and jelly. But when you\u0027re the first to figure out PB&amp;J tastes good together, it\u0027s going to propel your career, and that\u0027s what Puffy did.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABig Time\u000A\u000AAt Uptown, Combs became one of the label\u0027s hottest producers. In addition to Jodeci, he created hit records for Mary J. Blige, Father MC, and Heavy D. But as his profile rose, his unpredictable behavior began to grate on his co-workers, and before long Combs and his mentor, Harrell, were at each other\u0027s throats. At around the same time, Combs was introduced to a young Brooklyn rapper named Christopher Wallace, a.k.a. Biggie Smalls.\u000A\u000ASybil Pennix (staff member, Uptown): I was Puffy\u0027s assistant and Andre\u0027s go-to person to keep track of Puffy and his craziness. Many days we would have a planned meeting and Puffy could not be found. When he finally arrived, he\u0027d just lie on the conference table and perform antics to get everyone\u0027s blood to rise. He thrived on drama.\u000A\u000ACombs: I was always very dramatic—I still am, you know.\u000A\u000AChucky Thompson (producer, the Hitmen): He is the master of motivation. He would motivate you by using psychological tactics. In other words, he would straight mind-fuck you! [laughs]\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Jonathan Mannion\u000A\u000AGary Harris (music-industry vet and Uptown founding staff member): After a while, managing Puff was becoming a nightmare for Andre.\u000A\u000AHarrell: I don\u0027t want to rehash this joint anymore. I\u0027m gonna let that one go.\u000A\u000ACombs: It was my fault. I kind of embodied that hip-hop attitude and spirit, and I rebelled a little bit too much.\u000A\u000AMisa Hylton (fashion consultant and Combs\u0027s first love): I remember the day it got real. Andre fired Sean, and we gave it a week before I reached out to see if Sean could get his position back, as I was pregnant—in my first trimester. Dre said, \u0022No!\u0022 At that point, I became the biggest cheerleader, encourager, and advocate for Sean starting his label. I was never worried, not one bit.\u000A\u000AMatty C (journalist, The Source): I was in charge of the Unsigned Hype column in 1993. Puff called me up. I told him I had someone I\u0027d just put in my column who I thought he\u0027d like. And he said, \u0022Come play me some stuff.\u0022\u000A\u000ACombs: My mind was blown. I knew instantly that Big was the greatest rapper I ever heard. It was like witnessing a miracle or something.\u000A\u000AEasy Mo Bee (producer): At that time, the West Coast sound [led by N.W.A members Eazy-E, Ice Cube, and Dr. Dre, as well as a young Tupac Shakur] was winning. Big time.\u000A\u000AMel Smith (senior vice president of promotions, Bad Boy): On the East Coast, nobody was making hardcore records. Our records were about girls, how fly you were, and how bad your car was. N.W.A was about that thug street stuff. Biggie brought that world to life. I told Puff, \u0022This is groundbreaking.\u0022\u000A\u000AMary J. Blige (singer and Combs\u0027s protégée at Uptown Records): Biggie was one of the nicest people you could meet—so quiet. He\u0027d post on the wall, waiting his turn. But when he hit the booth... Damn!\u000A\u000AAfter Combs was fired from Uptown, he shopped around for a parent company to help him set up his own label, which he planned to call Bad Boy Entertainment. Many people in the music business thought he was crazy: Who would back an unruly, loudmouthed A&amp;R kid who\u0027d just been fired by his mentor?\u000A\u000ABlige: He was determined. Like, Puffy is a determined guy. And he\u0027s not going to let anything stop him. He constantly says that: \u0022I\u0027m not gonna stop!\u0022 He just kept going as if nothing happened. If it affected him in any kind of way, he didn\u0027t let us know it.\u000A\u000ASimmons: It looked like Puffy was finished a hundred times; it don\u0027t make no difference. No matter how many times you stab him, Puff ain\u0027t gonna lay down. He\u0027s a survivor. He\u0027ll reinvent himself.\u000A\u000AKenny Meiselas (Combs\u0027s lawyer): Within a short period of time we had the deal with Clive Davis at Arista Records, and we basically got all the acts we signed at Uptown, except Biggie. We had to negotiate to buy Biggie out of his agreement [with MCA].\u000A\u000ACombs: This was when they started shutting down hip-hop clubs around the country. So when we negotiated for Biggie, MCA was like, \u0022Sure.\u0022 They just knew him as a gangster rapper. They didn\u0027t know how talented he was.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Eric Johnson/Corbis Outline\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Bad Boy Family\u000A\u000ACombs\u0027s notion of what a music label could be was influenced by Motown—the music he grew up on. He wanted Bad Boy to have a unique sound, which he cultivated with the help of his in-house production team, the Hitmen, as well as a sense of community among his artists. Together they came to be known as Puff Daddy and the Family. In August 1994, two of his biggest stars, Faith Evans and Biggie Smalls, met at a photo shoot and soon became family for real.\u000A\u000AHarve Pierre (president, Bad Boy): Scarsdale, New York. Six Kolbert Drive. That was our first office. It was where Puff was living at the time. We worked out of the basement.\u000A\u000AJune Balloon (street team, Bad Boy): Everyone had their little station. You had people writing songs, producers working on beats. It was like a boot camp. And the guys were always hungry, because food around there was expensive. I used to come all the way from Queens to bring them Chinese food. One day Puff flipped out because the guys were starving so bad they ate Misa\u0027s food. Puff was like, \u0022Who the fuck is eating a pregnant woman\u0027s food?\u0022\u000A\u000AKeisha Epps (singer, 1990s girl group Total): Puffy was very hands-on, and he didn\u0027t take any slack—none. Of course, no singer should smoke cigarettes. But I did, and one day I took a break to sneak a couple puffs. He found out and damn near kicked down the restroom door. He was screaming not to mess up his money. I\u0027m like, \u0022Puffy, just wait. I\u0027m not a child.\u0022 Finally I opened the door, and he said, in his most quiet voice, \u0022Now, were you smoking?\u0022 I said, \u0022Yes, but—\u0022 Before I could finish, he said, \u0022Get your shit and go home. There\u0027s no studio for you today. Or evvvverrrr, if I catch you smoking again.\u0022 I left. That was one of many memorable moments with Puffy. He would be happy to hear that I stopped.\u000A\u000AFaith Evans (singer): Before Big and I broke the [marriage] news to Puff, people made it sound like we were in trouble: \u0022Did y\u0027all tell Puff?\u0022 We didn\u0027t see the big deal. Puff was like, \u0022What, are you kidding me!\u0022 Big said, \u0022Yeah, this is my wife. That\u0027s it. We outta here.\u0022\u000A\u000AHarris: Radio was a big hurdle. You didn\u0027t get the radio exposure for rap records that you get now. The most successful rap records were regional.\u000A\u000ASmith: Rap was like somebody\u0027s dirty little sister who dances at the strip club. That\u0027s how they treated us.\u000A\u000AHarris: The Chronic changed that to a large extent, because [Dr. Dre\u0027s parent label] Interscope was able to get a lot of Top 40 play. Then Bad Boy came in on the updraft. In the summer of 1994, Bad Boy had the crazy one-two punch of [Craig Mack\u0027s] \u0022Flava in Ya Ear\u0022 and [the Notorious B.I.G.\u0027s] \u0022Juicy.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Dana Linberg\u000A\u000ACombs: I\u0027ve always had this thing, even to this day, that if you\u0027re gonna do it, do it big. Be disruptive and make releases exciting. Nobody ever had the gall to release two artists at one time. So I was like, I\u0027ma shake the game up. I\u0027ma make MCA and Andre regret firing me. I wanted vengeance, in a positive way.\u000A\u000AEasy Mo Bee: I made that \u0022Flava\u0022 beat while standing in my drawers one morning. It took twenty-five minutes. At the time, I was real busy. I\u0027d already started working on Biggie\u0027s stuff, and I remember [Biggie\u0027s breakout hit] \u0022Juicy\u0022 was the song I didn\u0027t want to do. Puffy asked me first. He said, \u0022Yo, Mo. Loop up that \u0027Juicy Fruit\u0027 joint by [early-\u002780s funk group] Mtume for me.\u0022 And I just looked at him like, \u0022You serious, man?\u0022 If you were just looping, you weren\u0027t really working.\u000A\u000ACombs: One of my strengths was sampling—to try and give people the feeling I got growing up in the \u002770s and \u002780s. I remember watching Soul Train and dancing in my living room with my mother. I wanted to fuse those elements with what was going on at the time with \u0022gangsta rap,\u0022 or reality rap. \u0022Juicy Fruit\u0022 was a record that always felt like summertime in the city.\u000A\u000AEasy Mo Bee: Do I __regret not working on \u0022Juicy\u0022? Damn right, I do! [laughs] I wish I would\u0027ve looped that record up. I ain\u0027t gonna lie. Yo, Puff. If you can hear me, I dropped the ball on that one.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Birth of Bottle Service\u000A\u000AQ Parker (singer, R&amp;B quartet 112): We watched Craig get his hit. Big get all his hits. Faith. Total. Man, our on-base percentage was crazy! Everybody was hitting, whether it was a home run, a single, a double. You didn\u0027t want to be the artist that struck out or couldn\u0027t bring home a teammate.\u000A\u000AFunkmaster Flex (club DJ, radio host): Puff single-handedly brought champagne to mean something. If it wasn\u0027t for Bad Boy, there\u0027d be no bottle service in clubs.\u000A\u000AThompson: Money, cars, jewelry, champagne, baby mommas. [laughs] It was an exciting time. Oh, and did I mention the houses?\u000A\u000AParker: It didn\u0027t really hit us until we moved to New York. The first thing we did was go to Big\u0027s \u0022One More Chance\u0022 video shoot in Brooklyn, and we were just looking around at all these musical giants, like, \u0022Oh, my God. There goes Mary! That\u0027s Heavy D! Look at Aaliyah!\u0022 I mean, dude, you name it. It was like a big cookout.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMase (rapper): Before I met Puff, I was sleeping on the floor of a one-bedroom apartment in Harlem, splitting White Castle. You know how small White Castle burgers are, right? My man Cudda sold his Acura so we could fly down to Jack the Rapper [an Atlanta hip-hop convention]. We was going to meet Jermaine Dupri, but they wouldn\u0027t let us speak to him. Then I bumped into Puff on the dance floor.\u000A\u000ACombs: He was just so charismatic. With most of the artists I sign, it\u0027s love at first sight.\u000A\u000ABalloon: The ladies love Mase. This one night, we were leaving the club. Everyone hops into the fifteen-passenger van, and these chicks run in the van and right in front of everyone they start sucking Mase\u0027s dick! Now they fighting to see who\u0027s gonna catch the nut. I mean, it\u0027s crazy, and Mase goes, \u0022Wait, hold up. Y\u0027all can\u0027t be having my dick go all these different directions. Calm down.\u0022 One girl\u0027s on the phone like, \u0022I told you I was gonna get Mase. Bitch, I told you.\u0022\u000A\u000AEpps: I remember Big screaming at us for trying to send the groupies home. There\u0027d be flocks of girls at the hotel in each city, waiting to be called upstairs. We\u0027d tell them, \u0022You probably won\u0027t see Big or Puff, because you have to go through their boys first.\u0022 Some cared. Most didn\u0027t.\u000A\u000ABalloon: By the time we hit the Days Inn, all the girls is in the lobby and it\u0027s \u0022pick a winner,\u0022 basically. We had a name for that: Groupie Appreciation Day.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Gordon Gekko of Hip-Hop\u000A\u000ABad Boy and Sean Combs were on top of the world. But working for Bad Boy, and particularly for Combs, wasn\u0027t always a party. The boss was tireless and tyrannical, and he never let a dollar go unchased.\u000A\u000AJayson Jackson (marketing ecutive, Bad Boy Records): It\u0027s an unspoken rule in the music business that pretty much after Thanksgiving, it\u0027s a wrap. But for Puff, that\u0027s the time when you need to be setting up a rap record, because everyone\u0027s home from college, people are out partying. So he\u0027s like, \u0022I don\u0027t give a fuck what\u0027s happening in the larger music business; we\u0027re gonna be working!\u0022 People were livid. Then he doesn\u0027t give out bonus checks. Two days before Christmas, he makes us come into the office to get them. At 10 A.M. he\u0027s calling everybody to see who\u0027s not at their desk. Literally calling each person. By noon he calls a meeting in the lobby. We\u0027re all sitting there, waiting for him. The tension in the room, you could cut it with a knife.\u000A\u000AHe steps off the elevator with his bodyguards. He\u0027s got on a mink coat, dripping jewels, sunglasses. Looks at everybody. Goes to his office. Gets something to drink. I don\u0027t know, some juice. He\u0027s an apple-juice fiend. Keeps us waiting another five minutes, comes back, sits down, and looks at the room and says, \u0022Y\u0027all are mad as fuck, ain\u0027t you?\u0022 We know he\u0027s got bonus checks, so nobody\u0027s saying shit. And reading the room, he\u0027s like, \u0022You see me sitting here with my fur and all of that and you like, \u0027Fuck Puff.\u0027 But you know what? I dare one of y\u0027all to come get it. I dare one of you to work harder than me. To come get what I got.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe launches into this Gordon Gekko-like sermon, like, \u0022I come in here and work harder than you in the day, then go to the club and work. You think I\u0027m in the club getting drunk? I\u0027m looking at who\u0027s dancing to what, figuring out which song is working in what way, which DJ is making it hot. Tell me who\u0027s doing that more than me?\u0022\u000A\u000AI was just sitting there like, Holy shit. Who he is hit me. He sleeps no more than four hours a night. And every waking hour, he\u0027s figuring out how to make more money.\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve always said he\u0027s the greediest and most driven person I\u0027ve ever met—like, his greed is disgusting. Too much is never enough. But he\u0027s got a motivation and a drive that can match that greed. And when those two meet, it\u0027s magic. Biggie happens. Mase happens. He happens.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Jonathan Mannion\u000A\u000APac and Big\u000A\u000AAs Bad Boy became a powerhouse, it also accumulated some powerful enemies. The feud with Death Row Records began with the unraveling friendship between Biggie and Tupac Shakur. After Shakur was robbed and shot at a New York studio in November 1994, he grew convinced that his former friend was somehow involved. Shortly after, Biggie released \u0022Who Shot Ya,\u0022 which featured lines that seemed to mock Shakur for his shooting. Seventeen months later, Shakur dropped his infamous response track, \u0022Hit \u0027Em Up\u0022 (Who shot me? / But your punks didn\u0027t finish / Now you \u0027bout to feel the wrath of a menace). A rash of violence would claim both their lives over the next ten months. To this day, their murders remain unsolved.\u000A\u000AFunkmaster Flex: \u0022Who Shot Ya\u0022 was released after about three months of people saying Biggie was too commercial. It\u0027s like Puff was listening to the street and wanted to shut them up. When \u0022Who Shot Ya\u0022 dropped, that was it. King of the street.\u000A\u000ACoker: You have to understand what it was like to be on a dance floor when the DJ played a song like \u0022Who Shot Ya.\u0022 Beyond all the controversy, that record\u0027s incredible! You have to hear that record how it\u0027s supposed to be played—the way the highs and the lows cut through a few thousand people at three in the morning in a nightclub. There\u0027s no more compelling record on earth.\u000A\u000AEasy Mo Bee: We all know Pac and Big grew to dislike each other, but I was there while the two were actually good friends. I just happened to be recording the Me Against the World album with Tupac in 1994 when he invited Big up to the studio. It was real crowded. Pac had his crew up in there. Biggie had his crew up in there. I had half of Lafayette Gardens up in there. So many people wanted to see this, because Big and Pac were considered MC heavyweights at that time. Later on, when I heard about the beef, it was a total mystery to me. I was like, \u0022Yo, what happened? We was just in the studio.\u0022\u000A\u000AMatty C: There was a period when a couple other sparks flew off, due to the natural jealousy and envy that occur when someone is on his way to the top. But that kind of posturing is just par for the course. It\u0027s bravado. That\u0027s all I see it as. And to be honest, that\u0027s the way I saw Suge\u0027s potshot at the Source Awards that supposedly started it all, where he said, \u0022Any artist who wants to be an artist and wants to stay a star and don\u0027t want to worry about the producer trying to be all in the video, all on the record, dancing, come to Death Row.\u0022\u000A\u000ACombs: The West Coast thing was heavy on our minds. It was worldwide news that we were supposedly having this musical war or whatever. But there have always been different rivalries in hip-hop. You would never think any of them would go in the direction where it would be dangerous. In retrospect, we probably should\u0027ve just been safer.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ABad Boy for Life\u000A\u000AMase: After Big died, we were searching to see who was gonna carry the torch. Everybody would\u0027ve had the right to get out of contracts because of the violence. Instead, we rolled together. If I had a verse or beat that was better for you, I\u0027d just give it up. My verses on Puff\u0027s first few singles from No Way Out were records I wrote in that one-bedroom apartment in Harlem before I even got to the label. I gave them to Puff, because he was the one with the hot hand.\u000A\u000AHarris: When Puff put out that first song, \u0022Can\u0027t Nobody Hold Me Down,\u0022 it wasn\u0027t clear just how important he was going to be as an artist—that he was going to do an album himself that would sell 7 million units. Nobody saw that. Anybody who tells you they did, they\u0027re lying. Including him!\u000A\u000ACombs: For maybe like seven years, I was the hip-hop artist with the most No. 1\u0027s in history. It was like I couldn\u0027t miss a shot.\u000A\u000AFunkmaster Flex: I\u0027ve been on the radio and in the clubs for every movement that\u0027s ever happened in hip-hop—from Sleeping Bag Records to Young Money/Cash Money. I\u0027m telling you, ain\u0027t nothing shine brighter than that Bad Boy. Nothing had that energy.\u000A\u000ACRAIGH BARBOZA is a New York City-based journalist who has been writing about hip-hop since the mid-1990s.",

instant classic and possibly the most influential rap record ever made. For Sean &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs, the label&#x2019;s founder, it was the first in a remarkable streak of commercial hits: twenty-one straight gold- or platinum-selling albums, including Puff&#x2019;s own Grammy-winning debut,</em> No Way Out, <em>plus home-grown artists like Faith Evans, the Lox, Mase, Total, and 112. By the mid-1990s, Bad Boy was the biggest label in pop music. This is the story of how it all began.</em></p><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>Jadakiss</strong> <em>(rapper, the Lox):</em> Getting on Bad Boy was like being the top pick in the draft, going to play with the Bulls when Mike was there.

He wanted Bad Boy to have a unique sound, which he cultivated with the help of his in-house production team, the Hitmen, as well as a sense of community among his artists. Together they came to be known as Puff Daddy and the Family. In August 1994, two of his biggest stars, Faith Evans and Biggie Smalls, met at a photo shoot and soon became family for real.</em></p><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><strong>Harve Pierre</strong> <em>(president, Bad Boy):</em> Scarsdale, New York.

You had people writing songs, producers working on beats. It was like a boot camp. And the guys were always hungry, because food around there was expensive. I used to come all the way from Queens to bring them Chinese food. One day Puff flipped out because the guys were starving so bad they ate Misa&#x2019;s food. Puff was like, &quot;Who the fuck is eating a pregnant woman&#x2019;s food?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><strong>Keisha Epps</strong> <em>(singer, 1990s girl group Total):</em> Puffy was very hands-on, and he didn&#x2019;t take any slack&#x2014;none. Of course, no singer should smoke cigarettes. But I did, and one day I took a break to sneak a couple puffs. He found out and damn near kicked down the restroom door. He was screaming not to mess up his money. I&#x2019;m like, &quot;Puffy, just wait. I&#x2019;m not a child.&quot; Finally I opened the door, and he said, in his most quiet voice, &quot;Now, were you smoking?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, but&#x2014;&quot; Before I could finish, he said, &quot;Get your shit and go home. There&#x2019;s no studio for you today. Or <em>evvvverrrr,</em> if I catch you smoking again.&quot; I left. That was one of many memorable moments with Puffy.

The feud with Death Row Records began with the unraveling friendship between Biggie and Tupac Shakur. After Shakur was robbed and shot at a New York studio in November 1994, he grew convinced that his former friend was somehow involved. Shortly after, Biggie released &quot;Who Shot Ya,&quot; which featured lines that seemed to mock Shakur for his shooting. Seventeen months later, Shakur dropped his infamous response track, &quot;Hit &#x2019;Em Up&quot;</em> (Who shot me? / But your punks didn&#x2019;t finish / Now you &#x2019;bout to feel the wrath of a menace). <em>A rash of violence would claim both their lives over the next ten months. To this day, their murders remain unsolved.</em></p><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.2e"><strong>Funkmaster Flex:</strong> &quot;Who Shot Ya&quot; was released after about three months of people saying Biggie was too commercial. It&#x2019;s like Puff was listening to the street and wanted to <em>shut them up.</em> When &quot;Who Shot Ya&quot; dropped, that was it. King of the street.</p><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.2f"><strong>Coker:</strong> You have to understand what it was like to be on a dance floor when the DJ played a song like &quot;Who Shot Ya.&quot; Beyond all the controversy, that record&#x2019;s incredible! You have to hear that record how it&#x2019;s supposed to be played&#x2014;the way the highs and the lows cut through a few thousand people at three in the morning in a nightclub. There&#x2019;s no more compelling record on earth.</p><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.2g"><strong>Easy Mo Bee:</strong> We all know Pac and Big grew to dislike each other, but I was there while the two were actually good friends. I just happened to be recording the <em>Me Against the World</em> album with Tupac in 1994 when he invited Big up to the studio. It was real crowded. Pac had his crew up in there. Biggie had his crew up in there. I had half of Lafayette Gardens up in there. So many people wanted to see this, because Big and Pac were considered MC heavyweights at that time. Later on, when I heard about the beef, it was a total mystery to me. I was like, &quot;Yo, what happened? We was just in the studio.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.2h"><strong>Matty C:</strong> There was a period when a couple other sparks flew off, due to the natural jealousy and envy that occur when someone is on his way to the top. But that kind of posturing is just par for the course. It&#x2019;s bravado. That&#x2019;s all I see it as. And to be honest, that&#x2019;s the way I saw Suge&#x2019;s potshot at the Source Awards that supposedly started it all, where he said, &quot;Any artist who wants to be an artist and wants to stay a star and don&#x2019;t want to worry about the producer trying to be all in the video, all on the record, dancing, come to Death Row.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.2i"><strong>Combs:</strong> The West Coast thing was heavy on our minds. It was worldwide news that we were supposedly having this musical war or whatever. But there have always been different rivalries in hip-hop. You would never think any of them would go in the direction where it would be dangerous. In retrospect, we probably should&#x2019;ve just been safer.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.2j"><hr></div><div class="embed ol" data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.2k"><ol><li>Bad Boy for Life</li></ol></div><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.2l"><strong>Mase:</strong> After Big died, we were searching to see who was gonna carry the torch. Everybody would&#x2019;ve had the right to get out of contracts because of the violence. Instead, we rolled together. If I had a verse or beat that was better for you, I&#x2019;d just give it up. My verses on Puff&#x2019;s first few singles from <em>No Way Out</em> were records I wrote in that one-bedroom apartment in Harlem before I even got to the label. I gave them to Puff, because he was the one with the hot hand.</p><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.2m"><strong>Harris:</strong> When Puff put out that first song, &quot;Can&#x2019;t Nobody Hold Me Down,&quot; it wasn&#x2019;t clear just how important he was going to be as an artist&#x2014;that he was going to do an album <em>himself</em> that would sell 7 million units. Nobody saw that. Anybody who tells you they did, they&#x2019;re lying. Including him!</p><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.2n"><strong>Combs:</strong> For maybe like seven years, I was the hip-hop artist with the most No. 1&#x2019;s in history. It was like I couldn&#x2019;t miss a shot.</p><p data-reactid=".2ah589915og.1.1.0.0.4.2o"><strong>Funkmaster Flex:</strong> I&#x2019;ve been on the radio and in the clubs for every movement that&#x2019;s ever happened in hip-hop&#x2014;from Sleeping Bag Records to Young Money/Cash Money. I&#x2019;m telling you, ain&#x2019;t nothing shine brighter than that Bad Boy.
