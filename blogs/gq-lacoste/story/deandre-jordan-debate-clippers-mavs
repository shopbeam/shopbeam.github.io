  	    "articleBody": "The great DeAndre Jordan Hostage Crisis of 2015 may have been the most incredible slow-rolling Twitter storyline in the history of the platform: a wishy-washy NBA star barricaded in his own house, caving under the pressure—or maybe it was the smothering ardor—of his briefly-former, soon-to-be-current Clippers teammates to reneg on a verbal commitment to leave Los Angeles for the Dallas Mavericks, the entire NBA universe following the rapidly unfolding finking in real time, tweet by hilarious tweet. It was glorious. But wasn\u0027t it also, ya know, kinda shady and horrible? And won\u0027t it have, ya know, kinda far reaching consequences for every team in the league? GQ\u0027s squad team of NBA junkies dissects the DeCommitment.\u000A\u000ABethlehem Shoals:  DeAndre Jordan wanted out of Los Angeles for two reasons: To escape Chris Paul\u0027s iron (and ham) fisted leadership and to expand his role in the offense. Dallas seemed like the perfect opportunity: There was no Chris Paul; there might even have been a leadership vacuum, giving Dirk\u0027s soft-spoken ways; and with the departure of Monta Ellis, the team was going to need scoring (and a more varied attack) that could benefit from an athletic. big. Yet somehow, all that went from attractive to repulsive. Never mind dishonesty and deceit: This is one of the strangest reversals in the history of free agency. We are left scratching our collective scalps and asking \u0022why DeAndre? WHY?\u0022\u000A\u000AQuietly, surely, and in the shadow of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan has grown into one of the NBA\u0027s most valuable big men. He\u0027s not one of its best; Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins will be battling that one out for the next decade. There are also gaping holes in Jordan\u0027s game—namely, his inability to score on anything other than alley-oops or tip dunks and his abysmal free throw shooting. Still, when it comes to cleaning up the glass, swatting shots, and pogoing around on offense, Jordan is All - Star caliber. Widespread recognition had eluded him, since he did the dirty work. Lucky for DeAndre Jordan, he\u0027s now famous as all get out. But at what terrible cost? And did he make the right basketball decision?\u000A\u000ADevin Gordon:  Before I dive in, can I just say that my favorite part of this whole batshit saga is that it was all a battle to retain the services of  a man who once posted a three-part video series of him pretending to fart on people.\u000A\u000ABut seriously, folks, I think there\u0027s a grain of an explanation in all those farts. DeAndre is basically a very tall child. He is, by all accounts, impressionable, sensitive, and maybe a little bit insecure. He was going to sign a contract with the last person he spoke to that night, whomever it was, which is why all those Clippers evidently refused to leave his house after they flipped him. I love how the Clips passed the hours distractly DeAndre until the signing period began at midnight by playing cards and video games—it was like an NBA All-Star remake of \u0022Adventures in Babysitting.\u0022\u000A\u000AI am interested, though, in Shoals\u0027s question about whether DJ made the right basketball decision, because I am interested in someone mounting an argument that there\u0027s any doubt he did. The Clippers have just resumed being a title contender for the next three years (or until CP3\u0027s knee turns to ash). Those Mavs were going to be built around the mummified remains of Dirk Nowitzki, easy breezy Chandler Parsons, and… uh… DeAndre Jordan—a player whose scoring range, as Zach Lowe memorably put it this week, is \u0022the length of his arm.\u0022 I\u0027m sure it\u0027s no fun having Chris Paul yell at you every day, but would DJ really be better off catching lobs from Raymond Felton?\u000A\u000AMyles Brown:  It\u0027s hard to say whether DeAndre made the right choice without knowing what his motivations were. Initial reports were of a kind soul nursing a broken spirit, seemingly content to play in his home state surrounded by old family and new friends. DJ may have wanted more of a role in the offense, but it\u0027s doubtful he was ambitious enough to think of carrying one himself.\u000A\u000ASo if this actually was about Chris Paul, then what changed last night and how long could it possibly last? Is Jordan that gullible? Did he just want to feel needed? Or is it possible that the league\u0027s most diminutive despot is actually capable of remorse? Was this the galvanizing moment the Clippers needed to take the next step forward? Who knows? We have no idea what really happened in that house last night, but if that Ubuntu bullshit was real, they wouldn\u0027t have had to be there in the first place.\u000A\u000AThis team has always had a fragile psyche, partly due to their dearth of talent beyond its big three, furthered by Paul\u0027s searing skepticism. It\u0027s hard to tell if CP3 even likes his teammates, but he clearly doesn\u0027t trust them. When he does relinquish control of the ball, he immediately instructs them what to do with it. Any misstep is subject to scowls, shouts or sulking and it\u0027s hard to imagine such tension not having a cumulative effect. How can they believe in themselves if he doesn\u0027t? But maybe some folks are more comfortable thinking that one of the league\u0027s most efficient offenses blew a 19-point series-clinching lead on 5-for-27 4th-quarter shooting because they ran out of gas.\u000A\u000ASurely Lance Stephenson will change all of that. Right?\u000A\u000AShoals:  I think we can all understand Jordan\u0027s motivations from a competitive standpoint. There were times last season when the Clippers looked like one of the West\u0027s strongest teams. Of course, they have all the flaws that Myles pointed out, which is why they aren\u0027t the Spurs or the Warriors. Their capacity to self-destruct is unmatched. That said, they\u0027re going to be better than the Mavs, who despite all their recent moves, don\u0027t have that same star-driven ability to steamroll other squads. Jordan might well have looked at the competitive landscape of the West—especially with Spurs getting Aldridge—and realized that a potentially elite team was worth all the trouble, even if it was going to be a near-constant rankle for him.\u000A\u000ABut it\u0027s the psychology of DeAndre Jordan that\u0027s so hard to broach and also the thing we keep coming back to. He made a decision, allowed it to be publicized (or at least set up a situation where it was bound to be) and then totally changed his position. It makes him look flaky, indecisive, easily swayed, naive, or just plain dumb. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s any of those things, at least not to the degree that this incident makes him out to be. But he did put himself in a spot where he now gives the impression of possibly being something he\u0027s not. It\u0027s the picture-perfect definition of a bad look. Whatever happened to make him return to the Clippers must have really been profound because it came at no small expense to his image and the perception of him around the league. Maybe he\u0027s that strong. Or is it a matter of ego being trumped by a desire to win—the quality that drove the Warriors to a title and the same impulse that guided LaMarcus Aldridge this off-season?\u000A\u000AGordon:  What DeAndre Jordan did to the Mavs is completely human, to a degree that only the most unforgiving of us are willing to admit. Who hasn\u0027t had second thoughts about a huge decision? Who hasn\u0027t changed their mind about something and, as a result, royally pissed someone off? And hey,  at least DJ didn\u0027t do this to a blind guy.\u000A\u000ABut there is a way to change your mind about something this massive without being a total fink, and to put it mildly, DeAndre Jordan did not find it. If Mark Cuban is telling the truth that, at least as of midday Thursday, Jordan STILL hadn\u0027t spoken, emailed, texted or emoji\u0027d a single word—not even \u0022sorry my bad\u0022—to Cuban or anyone else in the Mavs organization, well…. Shoals, Jordan may not be flaky, or indecisive, or easily swayed, or naïve, or just plain dumb—but he sure seems like a monumental jerk.\u000A\u000ABrown:  I\u0027m not willing to go that far. DeAndre Jordan was the 35th pick in the 2008 draft. After leading the league in field goal percentage for the third consecutive year, grabbing the most rebounds for the second straight year and finishing this year on the All-NBA Third Team, he\u0027s still frequently dismissed as a one dimensional liability at the free throw line.\u000A\u000AChandler Parsons says DJ wanted a  starring role, but I can\u0027t help to think he just wanted to be happy and went along with what sounded good. To be needed, featured, and handsomely paid to play in his home state isn\u0027t something anyone would turn down easily. It\u0027s pretty easy to imagine being overwhelmed by it too. So why would he want to get yelled at again so quickly? Does anyone think that call to Cuban would\u0027ve gone well? Or is it more likely he would\u0027ve been threatened with legal action?\u000A\u000AMaybe the Clippers weren\u0027t there as captors, but as protection? Either way, after interfering in the most brazen way possible, they\u0027re just as culpable as their center. Maybe they should\u0027ve made the call. Or even his agent. That is customary, no? Except said agent, Dan Fegan, has a long lasting and well documented friendship with.....Mark Cuban. Until it\u0027s clearly explained why they wouldn\u0027t leave or his agent wasn\u0027t there, blaming one man for this fiasco seems too easy.\u000A\u000ABesides, if DeAndre never committed to Dallas, wouldn\u0027t they be in the same position right now? Their story doesn\u0027t add up. Cuban said they\u0027d \u0022take a step back\u0022 if they didn\u0027t sign Jordan. Then they offer Wes Matthews the max after tearing his Achillies? Word?\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s little proof that the Mavericks would\u0027ve spent that money wisely, if they found anyone at all. Mark Cuban gambles big and loses big. This isn\u0027t the first time he\u0027s been screwed by circumstances beyond his control. I doubt it will be the last.\u000A\u000AShoals:  At the end of all this, though, it\u0027s not about Jordan, it\u0027s about the Clippers. The Mavs didn\u0027t push him away—they welcomed him with open arms—and yet somehow he was persuaded to stay with the LA Team That Matters. (What ever happened to the Lakers\u0027 pursuit of him?) I get that it was a full-press team effort but at some point, I think all roads lead back to Doc Rivers, who basically runs that franchise from top to bottom. The Clippers may kind of hate each other but everybody likes playing for Doc, the rare players\u0027 coach whose greatest strength is getting guys to buy in. Maybe in the end, Jordan felt a sense of loyalty to Doc, who has basically allowed him to grow into what he is. Rivers would appear to have his best interest in mind. Why not continue to trust him? DeAndre Jordan may have thought he knew what he wanted, but if the guy who got you to where you are has a difference of opinion, it\u0027s hard to rule that out—much less overrule it.\u000A\u000AWhat I\u0027m left with is that DeAndre Jordan is gifted, wealthy, a valued professional, and someone who gets judged in a way most other human beings aren\u0027t. If you imagine yourself in his situation—caught between Doc and the lure of Dallas—it\u0027s totally plausible to think that you could waffle, or take in multiple inputs before realizing what you really wanted to do. Maybe he jumped the gun. But the Clippers also hadn\u0027t really bothered to try yet. When that happened, the balance shifted. Maybe it should\u0027ve been too little, too late. For Jordan, though, it wasn\u0027t. And if we can\u0027t understand how that could happen, maybe we aren\u0027t so human, after all.\u000A\u000AGordon:  I agree that everyone involved has egg on their face—except Blake Griffin, who killed this whole saga with his savant-level tweets—but I\u0027m standing by my view that DeAndre is a seven-foot omelette. Doc, as he should, has leapt to defend DJ\u0027s total blackout of the Mavs, basically saying, \u0022Hey, that\u0027s what agents are for.\u0022 But come on, Doc. DJ is a grown-ass man. Agents aren\u0027t human shields to spare you from the barest duties of being a decent person. If DeAndre didn\u0027t need Dan Fegen in the room to say yes to Cuban, he should\u0027ve found some way to say no for himself. Was he really too terrified to send even a simple text? Is it really too judgmental to call this out as wack behavior? One of many consequences of the Hot Take Era is the way we can chew over stuff until even the most cut and dried bad behavior becomes an ethical abstraction. Next time, DJ, pick up a phone. It\u0027ll suck for five minutes, but that\u0027s better than being label a weasel for the rest of your career.\u000A\u000AAnd who knows, maybe the Mavs are better off—they just got Zaza Pachulia!",

data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.0">The great DeAndre Jordan Hostage Crisis of 2015 may have been the most incredible slow-rolling Twitter storyline in the history of the platform: a wishy-washy NBA star barricaded in his own house, caving under the pressure&#x2014;or maybe it was the smothering ardor&#x2014;of his briefly-former, soon-to-be-current Clippers teammates to reneg on a verbal commitment to leave Los Angeles for the Dallas Mavericks, the entire NBA universe following the rapidly unfolding finking in real time, tweet by hilarious tweet. It was glorious. But wasn&apos;t it also, ya know, kinda shady and horrible? And won&apos;t it have, ya know, kinda far reaching consequences for every team in the league? GQ&apos;s squad team of NBA junkies dissects the DeCommitment.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.1"><strong>Bethlehem Shoals: </strong> DeAndre Jordan wanted out of Los Angeles for two reasons: To escape Chris Paul&apos;s iron (and ham) fisted leadership and to expand his role in the offense. Dallas seemed like the perfect opportunity: There was no Chris Paul; there might even have been a leadership vacuum, giving Dirk&apos;s soft-spoken ways; and with the departure of Monta Ellis, the team was going to need scoring (and a more varied attack) that could benefit from an athletic. big. Yet somehow, all that went from attractive to repulsive. Never mind dishonesty and deceit: This is one of the strangest reversals in the history of free agency. We are left scratching our collective scalps and asking &quot;why DeAndre? WHY?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.2">Quietly, surely, and in the shadow of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan has grown into one of the NBA&apos;s most valuable big men. He&apos;s not one of its best; Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins will be battling that one out for the next decade. There are also gaping holes in Jordan&apos;s game&#x2014;namely, his inability to score on anything other than alley-oops or tip dunks and his abysmal free throw shooting. Still, when it comes to cleaning up the glass, swatting shots, and pogoing around on offense, Jordan is All <strong>-</strong> Star caliber. Widespread recognition had eluded him, since he did the dirty work. Lucky for DeAndre Jordan, he&apos;s now famous as all get out. But at what terrible cost? And did he make the right basketball decision?</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>Devin Gordon: </strong> Before I dive in, can I just say that my favorite part of this whole batshit saga is that it was all a battle to retain the services of  <a href="http://t.sidekickopen10.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs644b_CW5v7d6b4WzD54W7fZnDC56dwWTf817tS602?t=http%3A%2F%2Ftune.pk%2Fvideo%2F2757810%2Ffart-prank-got-em-w-deandre-jordan-ep-3-the-noc&amp;si=5527898241892352&amp;pi=d5efc768-ec96-46f2-f226-f5a8bddd7206">a man who once posted a three-part video series of him pretending to fart on people</a>.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.5">But seriously, folks, I think there&apos;s a grain of an explanation in all those farts. DeAndre is basically a very tall child. He is, by all accounts, impressionable, sensitive, and maybe a little bit insecure. He was going to sign a contract with the last person he spoke to that night, whomever it was, which is why all those Clippers evidently refused to leave his house after they flipped him. I love how the Clips passed the hours distractly DeAndre until the signing period began at midnight by playing cards and video games&#x2014;it was like an NBA All-Star remake of &quot;Adventures in Babysitting.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.6">I am interested, though, in Shoals&apos;s question about whether DJ made the right basketball decision, because I am interested in someone mounting an argument that there&apos;s any doubt he did. The Clippers have just resumed being a title contender for the next three years (or until CP3&apos;s knee turns to ash). Those Mavs were going to be built around the mummified remains of Dirk Nowitzki, easy breezy Chandler Parsons, and&#x2026; uh&#x2026; DeAndre Jordan&#x2014;a player whose scoring range, as Zach Lowe memorably put it this week, is &quot;the length of his arm.&quot; I&apos;m sure it&apos;s no fun having Chris Paul yell at you every day, but would DJ really be better off catching lobs from Raymond Felton?</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Myles Brown: </strong> It&apos;s hard to say whether DeAndre made the right choice without knowing what his motivations were. Initial reports were of a kind soul nursing a broken spirit, seemingly content to play in his home state surrounded by old family and new friends. DJ may have wanted more of a role in the offense, but it&apos;s doubtful he was ambitious enough to think of carrying one himself.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.8">So if this actually was about Chris Paul, then what changed last night and how long could it possibly last? Is Jordan that gullible? Did he just want to feel needed? Or is it possible that the league&apos;s most diminutive despot is actually capable of remorse? Was this the galvanizing moment the Clippers needed to take the next step forward? Who knows? We have no idea what really happened in that house last night, but if that Ubuntu bullshit was real, they wouldn&apos;t have had to be there in the first place.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.9">This team has always had a fragile psyche, partly due to their dearth of talent beyond its big three, furthered by Paul&apos;s searing skepticism. It&apos;s hard to tell if CP3 even likes his teammates, but he clearly doesn&apos;t trust them. When he does relinquish control of the ball, he immediately instructs them what to do with it. Any misstep is subject to scowls, shouts or sulking and it&apos;s hard to imagine such tension not having a cumulative effect. How can they believe in themselves if he doesn&apos;t? But maybe some folks are more comfortable thinking that one of the league&apos;s most efficient offenses blew a 19-point series-clinching lead on 5-for-27 4th-quarter shooting because they ran out of gas.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.a">Surely Lance Stephenson will change all of that. Right?</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Shoals:</strong>  I think we can all understand Jordan&apos;s motivations from a competitive standpoint. There were times last season when the Clippers looked like one of the West&apos;s strongest teams. Of course, they have all the flaws that Myles pointed out, which is why they aren&apos;t the Spurs or the Warriors. Their capacity to self-destruct is unmatched. That said, they&apos;re going to be better than the Mavs, who despite all their recent moves, don&apos;t have that same star-driven ability to steamroll other squads. Jordan might well have looked at the competitive landscape of the West&#x2014;especially with Spurs getting Aldridge&#x2014;and realized that a potentially elite team was worth all the trouble, even if it was going to be a near-constant rankle for him.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.c">But it&apos;s the psychology of DeAndre Jordan that&apos;s so hard to broach and also the thing we keep coming back to. He made a decision, allowed it to be publicized (or at least set up a situation where it was bound to be) and then totally changed his position. It makes him look flaky, indecisive, easily swayed, naive, or just plain dumb. I don&apos;t think he&apos;s any of those things, at least not to the degree that this incident makes him out to be. But he did put himself in a spot where he now gives the impression of possibly being something he&apos;s not. It&apos;s the picture-perfect definition of a bad look. Whatever happened to make him return to the Clippers must have really been profound because it came at no small expense to his image and the perception of him around the league. Maybe he&apos;s that strong. Or is it a matter of ego being trumped by a desire to win&#x2014;the quality that drove the Warriors to a title and the same impulse that guided LaMarcus Aldridge this off-season?</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Gordon:</strong>  What DeAndre Jordan did to the Mavs is completely human, to a degree that only the most unforgiving of us are willing to admit. Who hasn&apos;t had second thoughts about a huge decision? Who hasn&apos;t changed their mind about something and, as a result, royally pissed someone off? And hey,  <a href="http://t.sidekickopen10.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs644b_CW5v7d6b4WzD54W7fZnDC56dwWTf817tS602?t=http%3A%2F%2Fsports.espn.go.com%2Fnba%2Fnews%2Fstory%3Fid%3D1848196&amp;si=5527898241892352&amp;pi=d5efc768-ec96-46f2-f226-f5a8bddd7206">at least DJ didn&apos;t do this to a blind guy</a>.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.e">But there is a way to change your mind about something this massive without being a total fink, and to put it mildly, DeAndre Jordan did not find it. If Mark Cuban is telling the truth that, at least as of midday Thursday, Jordan STILL hadn&apos;t spoken, emailed, texted or emoji&apos;d a single word&#x2014;not even &quot;sorry my bad&quot;&#x2014;to Cuban or anyone else in the Mavs organization, well&#x2026;. Shoals, Jordan may not be flaky, or indecisive, or easily swayed, or na&#xEF;ve, or just plain dumb&#x2014;but he sure seems like a monumental jerk.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Brown:</strong>  I&apos;m not willing to go that far. DeAndre Jordan was the 35th pick in the 2008 draft. After leading the league in field goal percentage for the third consecutive year, grabbing the most rebounds for the second straight year and finishing this year on the All-NBA Third Team, he&apos;s still frequently dismissed as a one dimensional liability at the free throw line.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.g">Chandler Parsons says DJ wanted a  <a href="http://t.sidekickopen10.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7lC8dDMPbW2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t5XZs644b_CW5v7d6b4WzD54W7fZnDC56dwWTf817tS602?t=http%3A%2F%2Fespn.go.com%2Fblog%2Fdallas%2Fmavericks%2Fpost%2F_%2Fid%2F4705530%2Fchandler-parsons-qa-we-did-everything-that-we-can&amp;si=5527898241892352&amp;pi=d5efc768-ec96-46f2-f226-f5a8bddd7206">starring</a> role, but I can&apos;t help to think he just wanted to be happy and went along with what sounded good. To be needed, featured, and handsomely paid to play in his home state isn&apos;t something anyone would turn down easily. It&apos;s pretty easy to imagine being overwhelmed by it too. So why would he want to get yelled at again so quickly? Does anyone think that call to Cuban would&apos;ve gone well? Or is it more likely he would&apos;ve been threatened with legal action?</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.h">Maybe the Clippers weren&apos;t there as captors, but as protection? Either way, after interfering in the most brazen way possible, they&apos;re just as culpable as their center. Maybe they should&apos;ve made the call. Or even his agent. That is customary, no? Except said agent, Dan Fegan, has a long lasting and well documented friendship with.....Mark Cuban. Until it&apos;s clearly explained why they wouldn&apos;t leave or his agent wasn&apos;t there, blaming one man for this fiasco seems too easy.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.i">Besides, if DeAndre never committed to Dallas, wouldn&apos;t they be in the same position right now? Their story doesn&apos;t add up. Cuban said they&apos;d &quot;take a step back&quot; if they didn&apos;t sign Jordan. Then they offer Wes Matthews the max after tearing his Achillies? Word?</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.j">There&apos;s little proof that the Mavericks would&apos;ve spent that money wisely, if they found anyone at all. Mark Cuban gambles big and loses big. This isn&apos;t the first time he&apos;s been screwed by circumstances beyond his control. I doubt it will be the last.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Shoals: </strong> At the end of all this, though, it&apos;s not about Jordan, it&apos;s about the Clippers. The Mavs didn&apos;t push him away&#x2014;they welcomed him with open arms&#x2014;and yet somehow he was persuaded to stay with the LA Team That Matters. (What ever happened to the Lakers&apos; pursuit of him?) I get that it was a full-press team effort but at some point, I think all roads lead back to Doc Rivers, who basically runs that franchise from top to bottom. The Clippers may kind of hate each other but everybody likes playing for Doc, the rare players&apos; coach whose greatest strength is getting guys to buy in. Maybe in the end, Jordan felt a sense of loyalty to Doc, who has basically allowed him to grow into what he is. Rivers would appear to have his best interest in mind. Why not continue to trust him? DeAndre Jordan may have thought he knew what he wanted, but if the guy who got you to where you are has a difference of opinion, it&apos;s hard to rule that out&#x2014;much less overrule it.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.l">What I&apos;m left with is that DeAndre Jordan is gifted, wealthy, a valued professional, and someone who gets judged in a way most other human beings aren&apos;t. If you imagine yourself in his situation&#x2014;caught between Doc and the lure of Dallas&#x2014;it&apos;s totally plausible to think that you could waffle, or take in multiple inputs before realizing what you really wanted to do. Maybe he jumped the gun. But the Clippers also hadn&apos;t really bothered to try yet. When that happened, the balance shifted. Maybe it should&apos;ve been too little, too late. For Jordan, though, it wasn&apos;t. And if we can&apos;t understand how that could happen, maybe we aren&apos;t so human, after all.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Gordon:</strong>  I agree that everyone involved has egg on their face&#x2014;except Blake Griffin, who killed this whole saga with his savant-level tweets&#x2014;but I&apos;m standing by my view that DeAndre is a seven-foot omelette. Doc, as he should, has leapt to defend DJ&apos;s total blackout of the Mavs, basically saying, &quot;Hey, that&apos;s what agents are for.&quot; But come on, Doc. DJ is a grown-ass man. Agents aren&apos;t human shields to spare you from the barest duties of being a decent person. If DeAndre didn&apos;t need Dan Fegen in the room to say yes to Cuban, he should&apos;ve found some way to say no for himself. Was he really too terrified to send even a simple text? Is it really too judgmental to call this out as wack behavior? One of many consequences of the Hot Take Era is the way we can chew over stuff until even the most cut and dried bad behavior becomes an ethical abstraction. Next time, DJ, pick up a phone. It&apos;ll suck for five minutes, but that&apos;s better than being label a weasel for the rest of your career.</p><p data-reactid=".khr6bd2bk0.1.1.0.0.4.n">And who knows, maybe the Mavs are better
