  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe greatest jokes, Louis C.K. tells me, never register as jokes. Not quite. The punch line of a great joke may punctuate it and make people laugh, \u0022but it doesn\u0027t solve the joke, doesn\u0027t stop it, so the joke keeps going and going and going...\u0022 And the more it keeps going, he explains, the more it tends to \u0022point.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Toward what?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well...nothing.\u0022 C.K. shrugs. By which, it turns out, he actually means: nothingness.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ll give you the perfect example,\u0022 he offers, \u0022but... Wait, is your oatmeal hot enough?\u0022 C.K. is an attentive conversationalist, lots of eye contact, asking as many questions as he answers. Oatmeal\u0027s fine, I tell him. \u0022I\u0027m sorry,\u0022 he says. \u0022I gotta get my oatmeal hot first!\u0022\u000A\u000AFair enough. It\u0027s a brittle February morning, the streets around this SoHo café glazed with black ice. He arrived on foot—his walk pegged him a block away, that crouched, duck-foot shuffle, a man wary of his own senses—and needs his porridge just right. Once it is, he continues. \u0022There was this comedian named Fred Greenlee, who got hot in the \u002780s. He had a couple of jokes about suicide that all comedians love. One was \u0027You know that thing when you put the gun in your mouth and the barrel touches a filling and you get that [whole-body shiver] uuughhhhh feeling? Don\u0027t you hate that?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AAfter I finish laughing, C.K. continues. \u0022I\u0027ve been trapped in that joke for thirty years. Happily so. First, there\u0027s the hilarious notion of having an annoying little twinge at that terrible moment. But then there\u0027s a—what is it, an epistemological problem?—that keeps me in that joke forever. \u0027Cause he\u0027s taking you down a road. You have a gun in your mouth. Okay...what\u0027s happened? You\u0027re sharing this peeve about the dental filling—does that mean you didn\u0027t do it? Did this irritation cause you to remove the gun from your mouth? Did it jar you out of your despair?\u0022 He\u0027s getting a little excited. \u0022Or are you a dead person commiserating with everybody who\u0027s ever shot themselves in the mouth? I love jokes that don\u0027t answer themselves completely, because you think about them forever.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen it comes to his own jokes, C.K. is proudest of those for which he must commit with Method-actor rigor to some rhetorical or moral absurdity—and then take his argument several parsecs beyond its \u0022logical\u0022 conclusion. He\u0027s always striking through the mask, Louis C.K. It\u0027s not just a matter of braying aloud what the rest of us only dare to think; he says things we aren\u0027t even aware we\u0027re thinking until we hear them from C.K. That\u0027s his genius.\u000A\u000AYeah, that word. I hesitate to use it. First because overuse has cheapened it into a kind of aerosolized cheese, and second because C.K. himself is ruthlessly precise in the way he uses and talks about language. (From his 2010 special, Hilarious: \u0022We don\u0027t think about how we talk.... \u0027Dude, it was amazing.\u0027 Really? You were amazed by a basket of chicken wings? What if Jesus comes down from the sky and makes love to you all night long and leaves the new Living Lord in your belly? What are you going to call that? You used \u0027amazing\u0027 on a basket of chicken wings! You\u0027ve limited yourself verbally to a shit life!\u0022) If Louis C.K., né Szekely, were \u0022merely\u0022 the greatest comic talent of his generation, which he is, he\u0027d merit...well, \u0022the most electrifying comedian since Richard Pryor.\u0022 But not \u0022genius.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe G-word applies because Louis C.K. is, like Pryor, so much more than, and more vital than, a comedian. I\u0027m not referring here to the quantitative \u0022more than\u0022 of C.K.\u0027s extra-stand-up professional life, mind-boggling as that is (writing/producing/directing/starring in his semi-auto-biographical FX series, Louie, starting its fourth season this month, large roles in David O. Russell\u0027s American Hustle and Woody Allen\u0027s Blue Jasmine, et cetera). I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027m not even referring to content—that is, to the endless shocks of self-recognition C.K. delivers, about how we Americans are and aren\u0027t thinking, feeling, fucking, connecting in the second decade of the twenty-first century. No, C.K.\u0027s genius is all about how he forcefully accesses that psychic marrow of ours, \u0022going there\u0022 in an era in which it\u0027s gotten all but impossible to shock. There is nothing he can\u0027t and won\u0027t demystify or de-sentimentalize. \u0022[My 4-year-old daughter] is a fuckin\u0027 asshole,\u0022 he rails in 2007\u0027s Shameless, thereby pimp-slapping everything decent everyone in his audience hopes they stand for. \u0022\u0027You think I actually give a shit about the dog you saw?... I\u0027ve got better stories than you. I have an interesting life. I\u0027m on TV. I won an Emmy. You don\u0027t ask what happened to me today in my life, you little bitch!\u0027\u0022\u000A\u000AForget demystifying. This is an obliterating genius, an absurd, self-disgusted, generous, horny, inquisitive, belligerent, deep-felt, smart-stupid, bare-naked, vulgar, deeply ruminative, face-fuckingly frank genius.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s Valentine\u0027s Day, and C.K.\u0027s crew has taken over a school in the Bronx for a series of flashback scenes. Junior-high Louie, played by an orange-headed stick of a boy, is being strafed by an even littler buddy named Brad with tall tales about another friend\u0027s mother.\u000A\u000A\u0022I saw her tits!\u0022 he squeaks.\u000A\u000A\u0022No, you didn\u0027t,\u0022 Louie mumbles into his lunch tray.\u000A\u000AA beat as the camera pans to the blehhh of the mashed potatoes. \u000A\u000A\u0022But what if I did?\u0022\u000A\u000AA question of metaphysical import, but C.K. lets it hang. He\u0027s less interested in the period than in the ellipsis, that blehhh—\u0022The pause before the question is more important than the question itself,\u0022 he tells me later—and keeps reshooting in order to get it, imploring his younger self to act...less.\u000A\u000A\u0022Let there be more drudgery,\u0022 he tells the boy. \u0022We don\u0027t need to see you process your own adolescent depression. That\u0027s on the inside. On the outside, you\u0027re numb, okay?\u0022 The kid nods. C.K. isn\u0027t daunting, but he is imposing, physically and psychically close, as he directs. In no small part, this is because he\u0027s gotten kind of in shape, enough so that the first thing you notice is that he\u0027s taller than you expect, a solid six feet.\u000A\u000AC.K. returns to his spot for a tenth take. \u0022Why am I being so anal?\u0022 he asks Steven Wright, the veteran comic he\u0027s brought on as a producer. C.K. dons earphones before there can be a response, so Wright explains to me that C.K. wants a more hapless, less-is-more portrayal of his teenage self.\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s what those years are like, right?\u0022 says Wright. The voice—the same sidling deadpan of his stage act. \u0022It\u0027s not like nothin\u0027s going on. Everything\u0027s going on. It\u0027s too much—you gotta sit absolutely still or you\u0027ll get dizzy. It\u0027s hard to get that contrast on-camera, but that\u0027s where the discomfort is, and that\u0027s what Louis is interested in.\u0022\u000A\u000ADiscomfort underlies all of C.K.\u0027s work—it\u0027s often both medium and message—and he seems to regard it as a moral imperative. \u0022You\u0027ve got to embrace discomfort,\u0022 he tells me at one point. \u0022It\u0027s the only way you can put yourself in situations where you can learn, and the only way you can keep your senses fresh once you\u0027re there.\u0022\u000A\u000ABlack kids were bused in to C.K.\u0027s otherwise all-white junior high school. Szekely, an incurably curious boy who grew up to be what Chris Rock has called \u0022the blackest white guy I know,\u0022 wanted to know them. Had to. So he began sitting at their table at lunchtime. \u0022It was awkward and scary, but I made a lot of black friends, and that was the only way to do it. It had to be uncomfortable. It was actually racist, \u0027cause I was sitting down with these kids only because they were black. Sometimes discomfort is the only way through.\u0022 \u000A\u000ANow a great whimsical moment follows: Little Louie agrees to amortize his own ass-kicking from a bully—one punch today, another next week. \u0022Good job,\u0022 the bully says encouragingly after Louie takes his lick. \u0022I\u0027ll see you on the twenty-first.\u0022 After several unsatisfactory takes, C.K. bids his actors to rid their brains of all \u0022forward memory,\u0022 i.e., their knowledge of what comes next in the scene. \u0022You know what\u0027s happening, but your character can\u0027t. You need to discover your own feelings as you speak. It\u0027s tricky, like playing Scrabble with yourself.\u0022\u000A\u000ATrickier still, because C.K. doesn\u0027t want his actors improvising. \u0022No vamping!\u0022 he barks. It\u0027s clear that he composes his dialogue as much as he writes it—his eyes are often closed when the camera\u0027s running—and that he has an idealized ecution of every line playing in his inner ear. After a disquisition on the properties of stoned laughter—\u0022less giggly, more evil\u0022—he gives up and lets the camera roll.\u000A\u000A\u0022How do you teach a 13-year-old who\u0027s never gotten high to act high?\u0022 C.K. asks. Wright gives a doleful kids-these-days shake of the head and says, \u0022You just can\u0027t teach that.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022You just gotta take him outside!\u0022 C.K. says. \u0022You gotta get \u0027em high!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAs much as anything, C.K.\u0027s musical ear, his ability to perfectly pitch, inflect, and layer a line, justifies the G-word. His description, at a 2010 Carnegie Hall gig, of being rudely woken at dawn by his children, is downright symphonic:\u000A\u000AAt six in the morning, I am sleeping...a beautiful, deep &gt; African sleep. I am &gt; fathoms deep in a river of warm chocolate, just...&gt; aughaugh. And Sleep is an ancient whore with twenty tongues just blowing me &gt; purrrrfectly and speaking a dead language.... &gt; OOOH la-shala ka-TOONZA salah ka-TAH! &gt; [lubricious schlong-schlurping sound] And she\u0027s feeding syrupy heroin into my dick while she\u0027s sucking. &gt; Lai-SOOR! MOON ta-ka-tah! Oh that\u0027s so good... DADDY! No. Fuckin\u0027 &gt; nonononono... DADDY!\u000A\u000AEven so, there\u0027s one respect in which the music C.K. chooses for a given moment doesn\u0027t matter. Whether it\u0027s a detonation (\u0022I\u0027m not an atheist. I think God is there and that He is watching and He made us. I just don\u0027t give a shit\u0022) or a meditation on the alienating power of cell phones that stays funny even as it takes on the convicting power of a sermon (\u0022The phones are taking away the ability to just sit there. That\u0027s being a person. Because underneath everything in your life there is that forever-empty thing...that knowledge that it\u0027s all for nothing and you\u0027re alone.... The thing is, because we don\u0027t want that first bit of sad, we push it away with a little phone or a jack-off.... You never feel completely sad or completely happy, just kinda satisfied with your product, and then you die\u0022) or one of the odder, funny-unfunny episodes of Louie that leave you discomfited yet vaguely grateful, one strand is always present. It\u0027s not a specific thing or theme but a vibe, a kind of undiscovered, in situ quality that C.K.\u0027s mind imparts to whatever it beholds, making whatever it is—sex, a Cinnabon an airplane—seem like something you\u0027ve never previously encountered. This is partly due to his X-Ray Spex: You and I are traumatized by the young girl in Schindler\u0027s List who jeers the Jewish families being marched out of Krak&amp;#xF3;w; Louis C.K. sees through—to the casting director\u0027s tape on which fifty bright-eyed 8-year-olds read for the role of the \u0022GOOD-BYE, JEWS! girl.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s all that inspired obliteration—of his own ego, first and foremost. And also of our unexamined notions about things so elemental—what it means to be a person, death, the need for sadness, how the human brain processes and empowers words like faggot, cunt, and nigger—that we can\u0027t afford not to examine them. That\u0027s C.K.\u0027s gift, his ability to eliminate governors, defaults, presets, any sort of separation from a moment, so that nothing stands between you and what he wants you to see. He sells his shows off his website for just $5 a pop, cutting out middlemen like Amazon and iTunes. Louie\u0027s actors often perform in their own clothes and rarely wear makeup. Even the way he entered for his Beacon Theater special—no musical or lighting cues, just Louis C.K. walking onstage, grabbing the mike, saying, \u0022Go ahead, sit down, we\u0027re just starting,\u0022 catching the audience before they were \u0022set\u0022—worked to erase any distinction between performance and reality, him and us.\u000A\u000AUsually you pay to see comedians because you want to laugh and escape yourself for a while. You go to see Louis C.K. to laugh, but also to connect to yourself in a way that\u0027s both alarming and reassuring. There\u0027s a certain moral clarity to his ebullient self-disgust, to the way he looks at himself from a distance, with all of us there beside him, asking, What the fuck? Even his mopey interstitial mumbles—\u0022I don\u0027t know.... I don\u0027t care.... I\u0027m all sweaty.... I don\u0027t feel good.... I ate too much and masturbated too recently\u0022—connect you to your own dilapidated humanity.\u000A\u000AIs it beyond comedy? Or the whole-life immersion, one man\u0027s body and soul, in a brine of comedy? Either way, this scatological 46-year-old, who admits with a shrug to having once \u0022let\u0022 his dog eat cottage cheese off his balls (\u0022something you now can\u0027t un-know\u0022), has more heartfelt, heartening things to say about family values than any politician in the country.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022No, I\u0027ve never been suicidal,\u0022 he says. \u0022But I\u0027ve wanted to be.\u0022\u000A\u000AI misconstrue this as a punch line—as if suicidal \u0022mopiness\u0022 were something all the cool kids were doing. But he means it straight up.\u000A\u000AThe first collapse came in the early \u002790s. He was gigging ten times a night, fifty bucks a pop, motorcycling up and down Manhattan from club to club. He remembers parking his bike in the Village one night and daring to think, I have the greatest life in the world. The next night, he was racing up Second Avenue at 70 mph and nailed a car running a red light. His whole body was a bruise. In the morning, he noticed for the first time that he was balding. Even then, the New York comedy scene had begun to implode. Big venues like the Improv and Catch a Rising Star folded; others cut back on their open-mike nights. Louis, who\u0027d bought a BMW with an AmEx card, struggled, couldn\u0027t pay his rent, and went broke.\u000A\u000A\u0022This went on for four years,\u0022he says. \u0022I thought a lot about another one of Fred Greenlee\u0027s suicide jokes. He said if you\u0027re going to jump, you have to pick a building that\u0027s high enough but also one that you can handle. You\u0027re like, What? Then he explains that you don\u0027t want to be going, AHHHHHhhhhhhh... [the descending Doppler fade of a man falling from a great height, running out __of breath, inhaling another lungful of air...] AHHHHHhhhhhhh...\u0022\u000A\u000AThen there was Pootie Tang, the 2001 comedy C.K. directed, based on a skit from The Chris Rock Show, where he\u0027d been a writer. The studio put him through hell—before firing him and recutting his footage into a puree.\u000A\u000A\u0022It never stopped getting worse. I remember thinking, This is too much for me to handle. I wanted to give up. I knew it was my right to. But then a few minutes would go by and I\u0027d realize, I\u0027m still here. In other words, there was no escape from it. And I\u0027d be a little disappointed at not being truly suicidal. I hated being \u0027all right.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000APeople make a lot of C.K.\u0027s endless energy and commitment to forward motion. It is astonishing: Many marquee comics spend up to five years perfecting a sixty-minute set. C.K. averaged one per year between 2007 and 2013, each acclaimed as among the greatest hours in the history of the art. (And it\u0027s \u0022painful labor\u0022 getting his material note-perfect: \u0022Once I start up, I\u0027ve got about 150 bad shows between me and my first great show.\u0022) But his commitment is as much a product of temperament as energy—a clear-eyed appreciation of what it is to fail, fall, and not die.\u000A\u000A\u0022All of that\u0022—the death of the New York club scene in the early \u002790s, the Pootie Tang debacle—\u0022has helped me form what I call my 70 Percent Rule for decision-making.\u0022 C.K. then describes a practical application of a worldview laced into many of his best routines—that \u0022everything is amazing and nobody is happy.\u0022 If we just wrest our eyes, literally and figuratively, from our digital gizmos and the shitty, spoiling impatience they instill, we\u0027ll see that this life, this planet, is amazing. That it is something just to be in the world, seeing and hearing and smelling. That for trillions of miles in every direction from earth, life really is blood-boilingly, eye-explodingly horrific.\u000A\u000A\u0022These situations where I can\u0027t make a choice because I\u0027m too busy trying to envision the perfect one—that false perfectionism traps you in this painful ambivalence: If I do this, then that other thing I could have done becomes attractive. But if I go and choose the other one, the same thing happens again. It\u0027s part of our consumer culture. People do this trying to get a DVD player or a service provider, but it also bleeds into big decisions. So my rule is that if you have someone or something that gets 70 percent approval, you just do it. \u0027Cause here\u0027s what happens. The fact that other options go away immediately brings your choice to 80. Because the pain of deciding is over.\u000A\u000A\u0022And,\u0022 he continues, \u0022when you get to 80 percent, you work. You apply your knowledge, and that gets you to 85 percent! And the thing itself, especially if it\u0027s a human being, will always reveal itself—100 percent of the time!—to be more than you thought. And that will get you to 90 percent. After that, you\u0027re stuck at 90, but who the fuck do you think you are, a god? You got to 90 percent? It\u0027s incredible!\u0022\u000A\u000AC.K. stops, looks off into some nether space, stays there for a spell.\u000A\u000A\u0022Are you thinking about your daughters right now?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A\u0022Ha! I am!\u0022 C.K. says. \u0022They do surprise you. When my older daughter was about 8, I showed her the routine where I get explosively angry because she sucks at hide-and-seek. She thought it was hilarious. My girls and I make a lot of dark jokes together. In the upcoming season [of Louie], there\u0027s a line from a conversation I had with my older girl. She was saying how whenever she sees a three-legged dog, it lifts her spirits, because three-legged dogs are wonderfully unaware that they have a malady. They just walk around, and they don\u0027t give a shit. And I said, \u0027You know, honey, they are lucky. But do you know the only thing luckier than a three-legged dog? A four-legged dog.\u0027 And she really laughed. Whenever she laughs that hard at something dark? I know it\u0027s good.\u0022\u000A\u000AAndrew Corsello (@AndrewCorsello) is a GQ correspondent.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest/images/entertainment/2014/05/comedy-landing-page/back-to-comedy-.jpg",

Not quite. The punch line of a great joke may punctuate it and make people laugh, &quot;but it doesn&#x2019;t <em>solve</em> the joke, doesn&#x2019;t stop it, so the joke keeps going and going and going...&quot; And the more it keeps going, he explains, the more it tends to &quot;point.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.2">&quot;Toward what?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.3">&quot;Well...<em>nothing.</em>&quot; C.K. shrugs. By which, it turns out, he actually means: nothing<em>ness.</em></p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.5">&quot;I&#x2019;ll give you the perfect example,&quot; he offers, &quot;but... Wait, is your oatmeal hot enough?&quot; C.K. is an attentive conversationalist, lots of eye contact, asking as many questions as he answers. Oatmeal&#x2019;s fine, I tell him. &quot;I&#x2019;m sorry,&quot; he says. &quot;I gotta get my oatmeal hot first!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.6">Fair enough. It&#x2019;s a brittle February morning, the streets around this SoHo caf&#xE9; glazed with black ice. He arrived on foot&#x2014;his walk pegged him a block away, that crouched, duck-foot shuffle, a man wary of his own senses&#x2014;and needs his porridge just right. Once it is, he continues. &quot;There was this comedian named Fred Greenlee, who got hot in the &#x2019;80s. He had a couple of jokes about suicide that all comedians love. One was &#x2019;You know that thing when you put the gun in your mouth and the barrel touches a filling and you get that <em>[whole-body shiver]</em> <em>uuughhhhh </em>feeling? Don&#x2019;t you <em>hate</em> that?&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.7">After I finish laughing, C.K. continues. &quot;I&#x2019;ve been trapped in that joke for thirty years. Happily so. First, there&#x2019;s the hilarious notion of having an annoying little twinge at that terrible moment. But then there&#x2019;s a&#x2014;what is it, an epistemological problem?&#x2014;that keeps me in that joke forever. &#x2019;Cause he&#x2019;s taking you down a road. You have a gun in your mouth. Okay...what&#x2019;s happened? You&#x2019;re sharing this peeve about the dental filling&#x2014;does that mean you didn&#x2019;t do it? Did this irritation cause you to remove the gun from your mouth? Did it jar you out of your despair?&quot; He&#x2019;s getting a little excited. &quot;Or are you a dead person commiserating with everybody who&#x2019;s ever shot themselves in the mouth? I love jokes that don&#x2019;t answer themselves completely, because you think about them forever.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.8">When it comes to his own jokes, C.K. is proudest of those for which he must commit with Method-actor rigor to some rhetorical or moral absurdity&#x2014;and then take his argument several parsecs beyond its &quot;logical&quot; conclusion. He&#x2019;s always striking through the mask, Louis C.K. It&#x2019;s not just a matter of braying aloud what the rest of us only dare to think; he says things we aren&#x2019;t even aware we&#x2019;re thinking <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGgS5GVCZwI">until we hear them from C.K.</a> That&#x2019;s his genius.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.9">Yeah, that word. I hesitate to use it. First because overuse has cheapened it into a kind of aerosolized cheese, and second because C.K. himself is ruthlessly precise in the way he uses and talks about language. (From his 2010 special, <em>Hilarious: </em>&quot;We don&#x2019;t think about how we talk.... &#x2019;Dude, it was <em>amazing.</em>&#x2019; Really? You were <em>amazed</em> by a basket of chicken wings? What if Jesus comes down from the sky and makes love to you all night long and leaves the new Living Lord in your belly? What are you going to call that? You used &#x2019;amazing&#x2019; on a basket of chicken wings! You&#x2019;ve limited yourself verbally to a shit life!&quot;) If Louis C.K., n&#xE9; Szekely, were &quot;merely&quot; the greatest comic talent of his generation, which he is, he&#x2019;d merit...well, &quot;the most electrifying comedian since Richard Pryor.&quot; But not &quot;genius.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.a">The G-word applies because Louis C.K. is, like Pryor, so much more than, and more <em>vital </em>than, a comedian. I&#x2019;m not referring here to the quantitative &quot;more than&quot; of C.K.&#x2019;s extra-stand-up professional life, mind-boggling as that is (writing/producing/directing/starring in his semi-auto-biographical FX series, <em>Louie, </em>starting its fourth season this month, large roles in David O. Russell&#x2019;s <em>American Hustle</em> and Woody Allen&#x2019;s <em>Blue Jasmine, </em>et cetera). I&#x2019;m pretty sure I&#x2019;m not even referring to content&#x2014;that is, to the endless shocks of self-recognition C.K. delivers, about how we Americans are and aren&#x2019;t thinking, feeling, fucking, connecting in the second decade of the twenty-first century. No, C.K.&#x2019;s genius is all about how he forcefully accesses that psychic marrow of ours, &quot;going there&quot; in an era in which it&#x2019;s gotten all but impossible to shock. There is nothing he can&#x2019;t and won&#x2019;t demystify or de-sentimentalize. &quot;[My 4-year-old daughter] is a fuckin&#x2019; <em>asshole,</em>&quot; he rails in 2007&#x2019;s <em>Shameless, </em>thereby pimp-slapping everything decent everyone in his audience hopes they stand for. &quot;&#x2019;You think I actually give a shit about the dog you saw?... I&#x2019;ve got better stories than you. I have an <em>interesting</em> life. I&#x2019;m on <em>TV.</em> I won an <em>Emmy. </em>You don&#x2019;t ask what happened to <em>me</em> today in my life, you little bitch!&#x2019;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.b">Forget demystifying. This is an <em>obliterating</em> genius, an absurd, self-disgusted, generous, horny, inquisitive, belligerent, deep-felt, smart-stupid, bare-naked, vulgar, deeply ruminative, face-fuckingly frank genius.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.d">It&#x2019;s Valentine&#x2019;s Day, and C.K.&#x2019;s crew has taken over a school in the Bronx for a series of flashback scenes.

He&#x2019;s less interested in the period than in the ellipsis, that <em>blehhh&#x2014;</em>&quot;The pause before the question is more important than the question itself,&quot; he tells me later&#x2014;and keeps reshooting in order to get it, imploring his younger self to act...<em>less.</em></p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.j">&quot;Let there be more drudgery,&quot; he tells the boy. &quot;We don&#x2019;t need to see you process your own adolescent depression. That&#x2019;s on the inside. On the outside, you&#x2019;re numb, okay?&quot; The kid nods. C.K. isn&#x2019;t daunting, but he is imposing, physically and psychically close, as he directs. In no small part, this is because he&#x2019;s gotten <em>kind of</em> in shape, enough so that the first thing you notice is that he&#x2019;s taller than you expect, a solid six feet.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.k">C.K. returns to his spot for a tenth take. &quot;Why am I being so anal?&quot; he asks Steven Wright, the veteran comic he&#x2019;s brought on as a producer. C.K. dons earphones before there can be a response, so Wright explains to me that C.K. wants a more hapless, less-is-more portrayal of his teenage self.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.l">&quot;That&#x2019;s what those years are like, right?&quot; says Wright. The voice&#x2014;the same sidling deadpan of his stage act. &quot;It&#x2019;s not like nothin&#x2019;s going on. <em>Everything&#x2019;s</em> going on. It&#x2019;s too much&#x2014;you gotta sit absolutely still or you&#x2019;ll get dizzy. It&#x2019;s hard to get that contrast on-camera, but that&#x2019;s where the discomfort is, and that&#x2019;s what Louis is interested in.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.m">Discomfort underlies all of C.K.&#x2019;s work&#x2014;it&#x2019;s often both medium and message&#x2014;and he seems to regard it as a moral imperative. &quot;You&#x2019;ve got to embrace discomfort,&quot; he tells me at one point. &quot;It&#x2019;s the only way you can put yourself in situations where you can learn, and the only way you can keep your senses fresh once you&#x2019;re there.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.n">Black kids were bused in to C.K.&#x2019;s otherwise all-white junior high school. Szekely, an incurably curious boy who grew up to be what Chris Rock has called &quot;the blackest white guy I know,&quot; wanted to know them. <em>Had</em> to. So he began sitting at their table at lunchtime. &quot;It was awkward and scary, but I made a lot of black friends, and that was the only way to do it. It had to be uncomfortable. It was actually <em>racist, &#x2019;</em>cause I was sitting down with these kids only because they were black. Sometimes discomfort is the only way through.&quot; </p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.o">Now a great whimsical moment follows: Little Louie agrees to amortize his own ass-kicking from a bully&#x2014;one punch today, another next week. &quot;Good job,&quot; the bully says encouragingly after Louie takes his lick. &quot;I&#x2019;ll see you on the twenty-first.&quot; After several unsatisfactory takes, C.K. bids his actors to rid their brains of all &quot;forward memory,&quot; i.e., their knowledge of what comes next in the scene. &quot;<em>You</em> know what&#x2019;s happening, but your character can&#x2019;t. You need to discover your own feelings as you speak. It&#x2019;s tricky, like playing Scrabble with yourself.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.p">Trickier still, because C.K. doesn&#x2019;t want his actors improvising. &quot;No vamping!&quot; he barks. It&#x2019;s clear that he composes his dialogue as much as he writes it&#x2014;his eyes are often closed when the camera&#x2019;s running&#x2014;and that he has an idealized ecution of every line playing in his inner ear. After a disquisition on the properties of stoned laughter&#x2014;&quot;less giggly, more evil&quot;&#x2014;he gives up and lets the camera roll.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.q">&quot;How do you teach a 13-year-old who&#x2019;s never gotten high to act high?&quot; C.K. asks. Wright gives a doleful kids-these-days shake of the head and says, &quot;You just can&#x2019;t teach that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.r">&quot;You just gotta take him outside!&quot; C.K. says. &quot;You gotta get &#x2019;em <em>high!</em>&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.s"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.t">As much as anything, C.K.&#x2019;s musical ear, his ability to perfectly pitch, inflect, and layer a line, justifies the G-word. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEBy3sKTG-c">His description, at a 2010 Carnegie Hall gig, of being rudely woken at dawn by his children</a>, is downright symphonic:</p><div class="embed blockquote" data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.u"><blockquote><p>At six in the morning, I am sleeping...a beautiful, deep &gt; <em>African</em> sleep. I am &gt; <em>fathoms</em> deep in a river of warm chocolate, just...&gt; <em>aughaugh.</em> And Sleep is an ancient whore with twenty tongues just blowing me &gt; <em>purrrrfectly</em> and speaking a dead language.... &gt; <em>OOOH la-shala ka-TOONZA salah ka-TAH!</em> &gt; <em>[lubricious schlong-schlurping sound]</em> And she&#x2019;s feeding syrupy heroin into my dick while she&#x2019;s sucking. &gt; <em>Lai-SOOR! MOON ta-ka-tah! Oh that&#x2019;s so good... </em>DADDY! No. Fuckin&#x2019; &gt; <em>nonononono... </em>DADDY!</p></blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.v">Even so, there&#x2019;s one respect in which the music C.K. chooses for a given moment doesn&#x2019;t matter. Whether it&#x2019;s a detonation (&quot;I&#x2019;m not an atheist. I think God is there and that He is watching and He made us. I just don&#x2019;t give a shit&quot;) or a meditation on the alienating power of cell phones that stays funny even as it takes on the convicting power of a sermon (&quot;The phones are taking away the ability to just <em>sit there.</em> That&#x2019;s being a person. Because underneath everything in your life there is that forever-empty thing...that knowledge that it&#x2019;s all for nothing and you&#x2019;re alone.... The thing is, because we don&#x2019;t want that first bit of sad, we push it away with a little phone or a jack-off.... You never feel completely sad or completely happy, just kinda satisfied with your product, and then you die&quot;) or one of the odder, funny-unfunny episodes of <em>Louie </em>that leave you discomfited yet vaguely grateful, one strand is always present. It&#x2019;s not a specific thing or theme but a vibe, a kind of undiscovered, in situ quality that C.K.&#x2019;s mind imparts to whatever it beholds, making whatever it is&#x2014;sex, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N1MoKF31mg">Cinnabon</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3dYS7PcAG4">an airplane</a>&#x2014;seem like something you&#x2019;ve never previously encountered. This is partly due to his X-Ray Spex: You and I are traumatized by the young girl in <em>Schindler&#x2019;s List</em> who jeers the Jewish families being marched out of Krak&amp;#xF3;w; Louis C.K. sees <em>through</em>&#x2014;to the casting director&#x2019;s tape on which fifty bright-eyed 8-year-olds read for the role of the &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGfDXMnQw7g">GOOD-BYE, JEWS!</a> girl.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.w">It&#x2019;s all that inspired obliteration&#x2014;of his own ego, first and foremost. And also of our unexamined notions about things so elemental&#x2014;what it means to be a person, death, the need for sadness, how the human brain processes and empowers words like <em>faggot, cunt, </em>and <em>nigger</em>&#x2014;that we can&#x2019;t afford <em>not</em> to examine them. That&#x2019;s C.K.&#x2019;s gift, his ability to eliminate governors, defaults, presets, any sort of <em>separation</em> from a moment, so that nothing stands between you and what he wants you to see. He sells his shows off his website for just $5 a pop, cutting out middlemen like Amazon and iTunes. <em>Louie&#x2019;</em>s actors often perform in their own clothes and rarely wear makeup. Even the way he entered for his Beacon Theater special&#x2014;no musical or lighting cues, just Louis C.K. walking onstage, grabbing the mike, saying, &quot;Go ahead, sit down, we&#x2019;re just starting,&quot; catching the audience before they were &quot;set&quot;&#x2014;worked to erase any distinction between performance and reality, him and us.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.x">Usually you pay to see comedians because you want to laugh and escape yourself for a while. You go to see Louis C.K. to laugh, but also to connect to yourself in a way that&#x2019;s both alarming and reassuring. There&#x2019;s a certain moral clarity to his ebullient self-disgust, to the way he looks at himself from a distance, with all of us there beside him, asking, What the <em>fuck?</em> Even his mopey interstitial mumbles&#x2014;&quot;I don&#x2019;t know.... I don&#x2019;t care.... I&#x2019;m all sweaty.... I don&#x2019;t feel good.... I ate too much and masturbated too recently&quot;&#x2014;connect you to your own dilapidated humanity.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.y">Is it beyond comedy? Or the whole-life immersion, one man&#x2019;s body and soul, in a brine of comedy? Either way, this scatological 46-year-old, who admits with a shrug to having once &quot;let&quot; his dog eat cottage cheese off his balls (&quot;something you now can&#x2019;t un-know&quot;), has more heartfelt, heartening things to say about family values than any politician in the country.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.z"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.10">&quot;No, I&#x2019;ve never been suicidal,&quot; he says. &quot;But I&#x2019;ve <em>wanted</em> to be.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.11">I misconstrue this as a punch line&#x2014;as if suicidal &quot;mopiness&quot; were something all the cool kids were doing. But he means it straight up.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.12">The first collapse came in the early &#x2019;90s. He was gigging ten times a night, fifty bucks a pop, motorcycling up and down Manhattan from club to club. He remembers parking his bike in the Village one night and daring to think, <em>I have the greatest life in the world.</em> The next night, he was racing up Second Avenue at 70 mph and nailed a car running a red light. His whole body was a bruise. In the morning, he noticed for the first time that he was balding. Even then, the New York comedy scene had begun to implode. Big venues like the Improv and Catch a Rising Star folded; others cut back on their open-mike nights. Louis, who&#x2019;d bought a BMW with an AmEx card, struggled, couldn&#x2019;t pay his rent, and went broke.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.13">&quot;This went on for <em>four years,</em>&quot;he says<em>.</em> &quot;I thought a lot about another one of Fred Greenlee&#x2019;s suicide jokes. He said if you&#x2019;re going to jump, you have to pick a building that&#x2019;s high enough but also one that you can handle. You&#x2019;re like, <em>What?</em> Then he explains that you don&#x2019;t want to be going, <em>AHHHHHhhhhhhh... [the descending Doppler fade of a man falling from a great height, running out __of breath, inhaling another lungful of air...] AHHHHHhhhhhhh...&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.14">Then there was <em>Pootie Tang,</em> the 2001 comedy C.K. directed, based on a skit from <em>The Chris Rock Show, </em>where he&#x2019;d been a writer. The studio put him through hell&#x2014;before firing him and recutting his footage into a puree.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.15">&quot;It never stopped getting worse. I remember thinking, <em>This is too much for me to handle.</em> I wanted to give up. I knew it was my <em>right</em> to. But then a few minutes would go by and I&#x2019;d realize, <em>I&#x2019;m still here. </em>In other words, there was no escape from it. And I&#x2019;d be a little disappointed at not being truly suicidal. I <em>hated</em> being &#x2019;all right.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.16">People make a lot of C.K.&#x2019;s endless energy and commitment to forward motion. It <em>is</em> astonishing: Many marquee comics spend up to five years perfecting a sixty-minute set. C.K. averaged one per year between 2007 and 2013, each acclaimed as among the greatest hours in the history of the art. (And it&#x2019;s &quot;painful labor&quot; getting his material note-perfect: &quot;Once I start up, I&#x2019;ve got about 150 bad shows between me and my first great show.&quot;) But his commitment is as much a product of temperament as energy&#x2014;a clear-eyed appreciation of what it is to fail, fall, and not die.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.17">&quot;All of that&quot;&#x2014;the death of the New York club scene in the early &#x2019;90s, the <em>Pootie Tang</em> debacle&#x2014;&quot;has helped me form what I call my 70 Percent Rule for decision-making.&quot; C.K. then describes a practical application of a worldview laced into many of his best routines&#x2014;that &quot;everything is amazing and nobody is happy.&quot; If we just wrest our eyes, literally and figuratively, from our digital gizmos and the shitty, spoiling impatience they instill, we&#x2019;ll see that this life, this planet, is <em>amazing.</em> That it <em>is </em>something just to be in the world, seeing and hearing and smelling. That for trillions of miles in every direction from earth, life really <em>is </em>blood-boilingly, eye-explodingly horrific.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.18">&quot;These situations where I can&#x2019;t make a choice because I&#x2019;m too busy trying to envision the <em>perfect</em> one&#x2014;that false perfectionism traps you in this painful ambivalence: If I do<em> this,</em> then that other thing I <em>could</em> have done becomes attractive. But if I go and choose the other one, the same thing happens again. It&#x2019;s part of our consumer culture. People do this trying to get a DVD player or a service provider, but it also bleeds into big decisions. So my rule is that if you have someone or something that gets 70 percent approval, you just do it. &#x2019;Cause here&#x2019;s what happens. The fact that other options go away <em>immediately</em> brings your choice to 80. Because the pain of deciding is over.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.19"><em>&quot;And,&quot;</em> he continues, &quot;when you get to 80 percent, you <em>work. </em>You apply your knowledge, and that gets you to 85 percent! And the thing itself, <em>especially</em> if it&#x2019;s a human being, will always reveal itself&#x2014;100 percent of the time!&#x2014;to be more than you thought. And <em>that</em> will get you to 90 percent. After that, you&#x2019;re stuck at 90, but who the fuck do you think you are, a <em>god?</em> You got to 90 percent? It&#x2019;s incredible!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.1a">C.K. stops, looks off into some nether space, stays there for a spell.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.1b">&quot;Are you thinking about your daughters right now?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.1c">&quot;Ha! I am!&quot; C.K. says. &quot;They <em>do</em> surprise you. When my older daughter was about 8, I showed her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqYxxZoXJVc">the routine where I get explosively angry because she sucks at hide-and-seek</a>. She thought it was hilarious. My girls and I make a lot of dark jokes together. In the upcoming season [of <em>Louie</em>], there&#x2019;s a line from a conversation I had with my older girl. She was saying how whenever she sees a three-legged dog, it lifts her spirits, because three-legged dogs are wonderfully unaware that they have a malady. They just walk around, and they don&#x2019;t give a shit. And I said, &#x2019;You know, honey, they <em>are</em> lucky. But do you know the only thing luckier than a three-legged dog? A four-legged dog.&#x2019; And she <em>really</em> laughed. Whenever she laughs that hard at something dark? I know it&#x2019;s good.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".etxn96nk74.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><a href="http://www.gq.com/contributors/andrew-corsello">Andrew Corsello</a><em> (<a
