  	    "description": "TV\u0027s funniest duo teams up with vaudevillian Ithamar Enriquez",
  	    "articleBody": "Just last week, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele aired the series finale of Key &amp; Peele. Over five seasons, they shared some of society\u0027s most elevated thoughts on race and identity through its most basic of currencies: eye-watering, belly-shaking laughs. In so doing, they not only became one of America\u0027s funniest duos; they became a voice of authority you couldn\u0027t afford to not listen to. So when they tell you they really love Ithamar Has Nothing to Say, a new show they\u0027re executive producing, you\u0027d be unwise to ignore them.\u000A\u000AThe comedic genius behind the show is Ithamar Enriquez, an actor you\u0027ve probably seen, but never heard of. Well, now you\u0027ll hear of him, but you still won\u0027t hear him. With producer Frank Caieti, he\u0027s taken a live show he\u0027s been doing in L.A. and turned it into six web shorts that are big on music, but light on talking, done in the vaudevillian vein of Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Mr. Bean. Depending on its success, there may be a longer, television series in the works, which means more laughs, more Ithamar, and more Key and Peele. So we called them up (separately) and asked them to give us some words about why we should watch a show that has so few.\u000A\u000AHow did this whole thing come about?Ithamar Enriquez: It actually started as a live show. I\u0027ve been out here for about seven years in L.A., and I\u0027ve been doing fine as an actor. I\u0027m getting work steadily here and there, but I felt like I hadn\u0027t really hit what I\u0027m supposed to be doing. So I decided to write a one-man show where I never said a word. The thought of that: Can that be done? Can a one-man show be performed without speaking?\u000A\u000AKey: I feel like you should only use dialogue where something can\u0027t be shown. If you need a new piece of information and it can\u0027t be shown, then speak. Otherwise, sometimes we\u0027re speaking just to hear ourselves speak. Cause if you\u0027re showing, that\u0027s a picture, right? A picture\u0027s worth a thousand words. And I think that hasn\u0027t changed in three thousand years.\u000A\u000APeele:  A lot of comedic engines aren\u0027t broken; they just need a certain updating. We take something that feels classic and juxtapose it with something that is happening right now that the old vaudeville stars wouldn\u0027t have been able to comment on. That\u0027s what he does.\u000A\u000ABut what do you say to the guy who dismisses it outright, who says, I\u0027m not watching a comedy show where there\u0027s no speaking?Peele: That person, I would ask, \u0022Well, do you like Looney Tunes?\u0022 Looney Tunes is a perfect example of that great comedy that just doesn\u0027t need words. It visually takes you through the comedic journey. It\u0027s proven itself over the test of time, that style. Comedy is something that is, in its core, it\u0027s timeless.\u000A\u000AIthamar: One of my favorite reactions I get is people saying, \u0022Wow. This is such a unique new art form.\u0022 It\u0027s not. It\u0027s the oldest art form you can think of. It\u0027s just that no one does it. \u000A\u000AKey: I\u0027m an enormous fan of Chaplin and Harold Lloyd and, Buster Keaton. They\u0027re still speaking to you, they\u0027re simply speaking to you with their body. And to me that\u0027s always intriguing. Because it allows the audience to do a certain amount of work. The most exciting movies I see, the most exciting plays I see, are when the playwright or the screenwriter or the director, they drop breadcrumbs for the audience member. And then the audience member gets a thrill out of solving problems and figuring things out as they go.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIs that something you think is important, that the audience do some work?Key: You can watch something and go, \u0022Holy shit! That might be the cleverest thing I\u0027ve ever seen in my life.\u0022 Like Jackie Chan, when a person watches Jackie Chan perform, you go, \u0022What just happened? How did they do that!?\u0022 The more you go, \u0022Oh! Oh! Oh!\u0022 The more you do that, the better your enjoyment of the piece.\u000A\u000AIthamar: It\u0027s so easy to mindlessly digest stuff sometimes. Like how many times when we\u0027re watching TV are we checking our phones? Because we\u0027re checking Twtter, we\u0027re checking Facebook. With a show like this, where there\u0027s no dialogue, it demands your attention. It makes you get invested because you can\u0027t really miss anything. The less noise you have, the more attention it gains. \u000A\u000AIt strikes me that even though this is silent, there\u0027s more levels or substance to it than most of the more mainstream stuff. Some of it is touching or poignant. Was there a desire to do more than just, here\u0027s another funny guy doing funny things?  \u000A\u000AIthamar: I\u0027ve always, always been drawn to physical comedy, to slapstick. I think as a kid it\u0027s always fun to see—as a very young child I loved Three Stooges, Little Rascals—it was just funny to see grown men fall on their face. As I got older and I started to watch more of Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, there was more to those guys than just the slapstick. There was more character. There was more heart. And they weren\u0027t just falling flat on their face for the sake of falling flat on their face. Charlie Chaplin was doing things because he was trying to gain affection for a woman he loved, or because he was trying to get out of a sticky situation with a bully.\u000A\u000APeele: The connection that Ithamar builds with the audience is just, it\u0027s really unparalleled. I haven\u0027t seen a show like it...He\u0027s a kind soul that radiates. Whereas in Key &amp; Peele I think we\u0027re to satirize the world and society and entertainment, I would say the feeling watching Ithamar is more like watching somebody who\u0027s sort of baring their soul and doing a comedy that is not jaded. There\u0027s a real accessibility and vulnerability. There\u0027s really no better word other than purity to what he does.\u000A\u000AKey: I think that as he [Ithamar] was putting this piece together and exploring it, he was discovering, I can bring more to this than slapstick comedy. It\u0027s a person living a genuine life, but he doesn\u0027t happen to speak the language of this new land that they\u0027re in.\u000A\u000APeele: The character he portrays you can sort of look down on as a simple dude, who\u0027s not particularly cool or doesn\u0027t have a certain social grace. [But] he\u0027s living his spot to the fullest that he can. And I think that there\u0027s something attractive to the human condition, because when we as people are happy, we\u0027re doing that in the face of our own adversity. We\u0027re making something beautiful out of life, which contains death and sorrow and war and all the negative things.\u000A\u000AI think there\u0027s a reason it\u0027s a very spiritually fulfilling comedic archetype to watch. Bugs Bunny is another example. Here\u0027s a guy who lives in a hole in the ground, eating a carrot, but he\u0027s going, \u0022Ah, this is the life!\u0022 From the beginning of any Bugs Bunny, he\u0027s got us. We love him. I want to spend time with that. I want that infectious feeling. He makes me feel better about where I\u0027m at. \u000A\u000AIthamar: When you look at some Second City alums like Steve Carell, Bill Murray, John Candy, and Peele and Keegan, these are guys that are hilarious. But there\u0027s so much more. The reason we laugh at them is not because they\u0027re saying funny things. It\u0027s not because they\u0027re saying jokes. It\u0027s because they\u0027re playing characters who have a life, and we\u0027re laughing because we\u0027re seeing these characters in situations that sort of cast their own emotions.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASo you\u0027re saying the humor exists not so much in the laughs as it does in the audience\u0027s ability to recognize themselves in the absurdities of the character you\u0027re projecting?Ithamar: First and foremost, you want it to be funny. But you want the laughs to come out of the situation. Not just because a cheap laugh. I mean in the laundromat scene where I\u0027m wrestling a blanket, yeah, we have some nut shots. Nut shots are funny, I would hope, but the reason it makes it even funnier is because it\u0027s this guy living this fantasy of being a wrestler in the laundromat, and that\u0027s what makes it funny. Not just because a blanket is punching a guy in the nuts.\u000A\u000APeele: The moments you laugh at Ithamar the most are the moments where you can just tell in his performance, he\u0027s dealing with something that you\u0027ve dealt with on an everyday basis. Something like where he\u0027s in the laundromat and he\u0027s battling this thing, there\u0027s an absurdity to how far he takes it, but he\u0027s able, with his performance, to make it feel like only a slight heightening of what I\u0027ve gone through trying to fold things in my own life.\u000A\u000AIthamar: Sometimes I would just sit in public places and just study people. Really sit and watch people—what they do physically without really knowing. It\u0027s fascinating. The things that we do. If you catch yourself, like when you\u0027re driving, and you\u0027re really feeling the song, if we took the song out and we just saw you pumping your fist or closing your eyes, you would look ridiculous, and I think that\u0027s really fascinating to me, too: the things we don\u0027t realize we\u0027re doing every single day.\u000A\u000AI really love jazz music, and I think I actually caught myself making the jazz face, which we call what happens in that short, a Jazz Face. I was listening to a record, maybe it was of Miles Davis or something, and I caught myself doing that face that they do when they listen to jazz, and I was like, \u0022Oh my gosh. This is ridiculous. What am I doing? What is this?\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd where do you find the ideas for these instances of universal human weirdness?Ithamar: I sat in a coffee shop once when I was thinking up ideas, and you learn that physically, people are still trying to put up a façade. So if someone is sitting by themselves at a coffee shop, they might be reading a book or drinking a cup of coffee, but you can tell that they\u0027re there to be seen. Maybe they\u0027re single, maybe they\u0027re on the lookout, whatever it is; or you see someone really, really hypnotized by their own screenplay when they\u0027re typing on their own laptop; or you see someone looking really sad; or you see someone looking around, checking someone out; or you see two people talking. One person has found a way to put every part of their body on the chair without putting it on the floor. So their knees are like hiked up to their ears, their hands are tucked under their butt.\u000A\u000AAnd yet we never notice those people because of the noise.Ithamar: And every day you wouldn\u0027t even stop to notice because you\u0027re just like, \u0022Oh, it\u0027s just a coffee shop.\u0022 But when you\u0027re sitting there studying it, oh, it\u0027s fascinating. It\u0027s like studying animals. It really is. Kind of like when you see a dog or cat do something funny that they don\u0027t even realize what they\u0027re doing, humans are the same way. We are the same exact way.",

data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.0">Just last week, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele aired the series finale of <em><a href="key-and-peele-best-sketches-wonderful-show">Key &amp; Peele</a></em>. Over five seasons, they shared some of society&apos;s most elevated thoughts on race and identity through its most basic of currencies: eye-watering, belly-shaking laughs. In so doing, they not only became one of America&apos;s funniest duos; they became a voice of authority you couldn&apos;t afford to not listen to. So when they tell you they really love <em>Ithamar Has Nothing to Say</em>, a new show they&apos;re executive producing, you&apos;d be unwise to ignore them.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.1">The comedic genius behind the show is <a href="https://twitter.com/IthamarEnriquez?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ithamar Enriquez</a>, an actor you&apos;ve probably seen, but never heard of. Well, now you&apos;ll hear <em>of</em> him, but you still won&apos;t <em>hear</em> him. With producer Frank Caieti, he&apos;s taken a live show he&apos;s been doing in L.A. and turned it into six web shorts that are big on music, but light on talking, done in the vaudevillian vein of Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Mr. Bean. Depending on its success, there may be a longer, television series in the works, which means more laughs, more Ithamar, and more Key and Peele. So we called them up (separately) and asked them to give us some words about why we should watch a show that has so few.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>How did this whole thing come about?</strong><br><strong>Ithamar Enriquez</strong>: It actually started as a live show. I&#x2019;ve been out here for about seven years in L.A., and I&#x2019;ve been doing fine as an actor. I&#x2019;m getting work steadily here and there, but I felt like I hadn&#x2019;t really hit what I&#x2019;m supposed to be doing. So I decided to write a one-man show where I never said a word. The thought of that: <em>Can that be done? Can a one-man show be performed without speaking?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>Key</strong>: I feel like you should only use dialogue where something can&#x2019;t be shown. If you need a new piece of information and it can&#x2019;t be shown, then speak. Otherwise, sometimes we&#x2019;re speaking just to hear ourselves speak. Cause if you&#x2019;re showing, that&#x2019;s a picture, right? A picture&#x2019;s worth a thousand words. And I think that hasn&#x2019;t changed in three thousand years.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Peele</strong>:  A lot of comedic engines aren&#x2019;t broken; they just need a certain updating. We take something that feels classic and juxtapose it with something that is happening right now that the old vaudeville stars wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to comment on. That&#x2019;s what he does.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>But what do you say to the guy who dismisses it outright, who says, <em>I&#x2019;m not watching a comedy show where there&#x2019;s no speaking</em>?</strong><br><strong>Peele</strong>: That person, I would ask, &quot;Well, do you like <em>Looney Tunes</em>?&quot; <em>Looney Tunes</em> is a perfect example of that great comedy that just doesn&#x2019;t need words. It visually takes you through the comedic journey. It&#x2019;s proven itself over the test of time, that style. Comedy is something that is, in its core, it&#x2019;s timeless.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Ithamar</strong>: One of my favorite reactions I get is people saying, &#x201C;Wow. This is such a unique new art form.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s the oldest art form you can think of. It&#x2019;s just that no one does it. </p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Key</strong>: I&#x2019;m an <em>enormous</em> fan of Chaplin and Harold Lloyd and, Buster Keaton. They&#x2019;re still speaking to you, they&#x2019;re simply speaking to you with their body. And to me that&#x2019;s always intriguing. Because it allows the audience to do a certain amount of work. The most exciting movies I see, the most exciting plays I see, are when the playwright or the screenwriter or the director, they drop breadcrumbs for the audience member. And then the audience member gets a thrill out of solving problems and figuring things out as they go.</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.9"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="http://makerplayer.com/embed/maker/C0SAgS98kBiB" height="360" width="640"></iframe></div></div><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Is that something you think is important, that the audience do some work?</strong><br><strong>Key</strong>: You can watch something and go, &quot;Holy shit! That might be the cleverest thing I&#x2019;ve ever seen in my life.&quot; Like Jackie Chan, when a person watches Jackie Chan perform, you go, &quot;What just happened? How did they do that!?&quot; The more you go, &quot;Oh! Oh! Oh!&quot; The more you do that, the better your enjoyment of the piece.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Ithamar</strong>: It&#x2019;s so easy to mindlessly digest stuff sometimes. Like how many times when we&#x2019;re watching TV are we checking our phones? Because we&#x2019;re checking Twtter, we&#x2019;re checking Facebook. With a show like this, where there&#x2019;s no dialogue, it demands your attention. It makes you get invested because you can&#x2019;t really miss anything. The less noise you have, the more attention it gains. </p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>It strikes me that even though this is silent, there&#x2019;s more levels or substance to it than most of the more mainstream stuff. Some of it is <a href="http://www.maker.tv/originals/ithamar/video/nnCDZw64iP0z/playlist/ithamar">touching or poignant</a>. Was there a desire to do more than just, here&#x2019;s another funny guy doing funny things?</strong>  </p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Ithamar</strong>: I&#x2019;ve always, always been drawn to physical comedy, to slapstick. I think as a kid it&#x2019;s always fun to see&#x2014;as a very young child <em>I loved Three Stooges, Little Rascals</em>&#x2014;it was just funny to see grown men fall on their face. As I got older and I started to watch more of Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, there was more to those guys than just the slapstick. There was more character. There was more heart. And they weren&#x2019;t just falling flat on their face for the sake of falling flat on their face. Charlie Chaplin was doing things because he was trying to gain affection for a woman he loved, or because he was trying to get out of a sticky situation with a bully.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Peele</strong>: The connection that Ithamar builds with the audience is just, it&#x2019;s really unparalleled. I haven&#x2019;t seen a show like it...He&#x2019;s a kind soul that radiates. Whereas in <em>Key &amp; Peele</em> I think we&#x2019;re to satirize the world and society and entertainment, I would say the feeling watching Ithamar is more like watching somebody who&#x2019;s sort of baring their soul and doing a comedy that is not jaded. There&#x2019;s a real accessibility and vulnerability. There&#x2019;s really no better word other than purity to what he does.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Key</strong>: I think that as he [Ithamar] was putting this piece together and exploring it, he was discovering, I can bring more to this than slapstick comedy. It&#x2019;s a person living a genuine life, but he doesn&#x2019;t happen to speak the language of this new land that they&#x2019;re in.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Peele</strong>: The character he portrays you can sort of look down on as a simple dude, who&#x2019;s not particularly cool or doesn&#x2019;t have a certain social grace. [But] he&#x2019;s living his spot to the fullest that he can. And I think that there&#x2019;s something attractive to the human condition, because when we as people are happy, we&#x2019;re doing that in the face of our own adversity. We&#x2019;re making something beautiful out of life, which contains death and sorrow and war and all the negative things.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.h">I think there&#x2019;s a reason it&#x2019;s a very spiritually fulfilling comedic archetype to watch. Bugs Bunny is another example. Here&#x2019;s a guy who lives in a hole in the ground, eating a carrot, but he&#x2019;s going, &quot;Ah, this is the life!&quot; From the beginning of any Bugs Bunny, he&#x2019;s got us. We love him. I want to spend time with that. I want that infectious feeling. He makes me feel better about where I&#x2019;m at. </p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Ithamar</strong>: When you look at some Second City alums like Steve Carell, Bill Murray, John Candy, and Peele and Keegan, these are guys that are hilarious. But there&#x2019;s so much more. The reason we laugh at them is not because they&#x2019;re saying funny things. It&#x2019;s not because they&#x2019;re saying jokes. It&#x2019;s because they&#x2019;re playing characters who have a life, and we&#x2019;re laughing because we&#x2019;re seeing these characters in situations that sort of cast their own emotions.</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.j"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="http://makerplayer.com/embed/maker/uT9JUKBuqEp1" height="360" width="640"></iframe></div></div><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>So you&apos;re saying the humor exists not so much in the laughs as it does in the audience&#x2019;s ability to recognize themselves in the absurdities of the character you&#x2019;re projecting?</strong><br><strong>Ithamar</strong>: First and foremost, you want it to be funny. But you want the laughs to come out of the situation. Not just because a cheap laugh. I mean in the <a href="http://www.maker.tv/originals/ithamar/video/PUGr0Ppd7XQN/playlist/ithamar">laundromat scene</a> where I&#x2019;m wrestling a blanket, yeah, we have some nut shots. Nut shots are funny, I would hope, but the reason it makes it even funnier is because it&#x2019;s this guy living this fantasy of being a wrestler in the laundromat, and that&#x2019;s what makes it funny. Not just because a blanket is punching a guy in the nuts.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>Peele</strong>: The moments you laugh at Ithamar the most are the moments where you can just tell in his performance, he&#x2019;s dealing with something that you&#x2019;ve dealt with on an everyday basis. Something like where he&#x2019;s in the laundromat and he&#x2019;s battling this thing, there&#x2019;s an absurdity to how far he takes it, but he&#x2019;s able, with his performance, to make it feel like only a slight heightening of what I&#x2019;ve gone through trying to fold things in my own life.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Ithamar</strong>: Sometimes I would just sit in public places and just study people. Really sit and watch people&#x2014;what they do physically without really knowing. It&#x2019;s fascinating. The things that we do. If you catch yourself, like when you&#x2019;re driving, and you&apos;re really feeling the song, if we took the song out and we just saw you pumping your fist or closing your eyes, you would look ridiculous, and I think that&#x2019;s really fascinating to me, too: the things we don&#x2019;t realize we&#x2019;re doing every single day.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.n">I really love jazz music, and I think I actually caught myself making the jazz face, which we call what happens <a href="http://www.maker.tv/originals/ithamar/video/cwqRXP8JyWL4/playlist/ithamar">in that short, a Jazz Face</a>. I was listening to a record, maybe it was of Miles Davis or something, and I caught myself doing that face that they do when they listen to jazz, and I was like, &#x201C;Oh my gosh. This is ridiculous. What am I doing? What is this?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>And where do you find the ideas for these instances of universal human weirdness?</strong><br><strong>Ithamar</strong>: I sat in a coffee shop once when I was thinking up ideas, and you learn that physically, people are still trying to put up a fa&#xE7;ade. So if someone is sitting by themselves at a coffee shop, they might be reading a book or drinking a cup of coffee, but you can tell that they&#x2019;re there to be seen. Maybe they&#x2019;re single, maybe they&#x2019;re on the lookout, whatever it is; or you see someone really, really hypnotized by their own screenplay when they&#x2019;re typing on their own laptop; or you see someone looking really sad; or you see someone looking around, checking someone out; or you see two people talking. One person has found a way to put every part of their body on the chair without putting it on the floor. So their knees are like hiked up to their ears, their hands are tucked under their butt.</p><p data-reactid=".1pq8xnii3gg.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>And yet we never notice those people because of the noise.</strong><br><strong>Ithamar</strong>: And every day you wouldn&#x2019;t even stop to notice because you&#x2019;re just like, &#x201C;Oh, it&#x2019;s just a coffee shop.&#x201D; But when you&#x2019;re sitting there studying it, oh, it&#x2019;s fascinating. It&#x2019;s like studying animals. It really is. Kind of like when you see a dog or cat do something funny that they don&#x2019;t even realize what they&#x2019;re doing, humans are the same way.
