  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AGoing into this season, some people thought Jimmy Butler was making a big gamble on his career after deciding to not sign an extension with the Chicago Bulls. As a relatively unproven player, it seemed like the potential downside far outweighed any upside. But by the time the season ended, it was clear he\u0027d bet correctly. Not only did Butler make the All-Star team and emerge as one of the NBA\u0027s best two-way players, but he asserted himself as arguably the Bulls\u0027 leader down the stretch. (And remember, this is the same team that has former MVP Derrick Rose on its roster.)\u000A\u000AA lot of hard work went into making Jimmy the player he was this season, but hey, maybe he owes a little bit to the shoes. Before the 2014-15 season he announced that he had left Adidas to sign with Jordan brand after sitting out a portion of the previous season with turf toe. And while the new contract he\u0027ll get this offseason, whatever city it lands him in, is set to pay him handsomely (potentially $16 million/year handsomely), his endorsement deal with Jordan brand was for reportedly 75% less than he was making at Adidas, something that\u0027s unheard of in the NBA or any professional sport.\u000A\u000AHis differences from the average player don\u0027t end there. He admits his style has changed recently, but until then Jimmy Butler\u0027s been most known as maybe the only NBA player to truly love country music, and furthermore, country style. Before signing with Jordan, he would even wear cowboy boots to the arena before every game. You put all that together, and it\u0027s easy to see why every team in the NBA sees him as the league\u0027s next superstar. Here, we talked to Jimmy about country music style, leaving Adidas for Jordan, and what it\u0027s like to be one of the most coveted players this offseason.\u000A\u000ATell us where youre from, and a little bit about yourself. Youre from Houston, right?\u000A\u000AAh, dont do that. Im from Tomball. Lets just get that straight away. Im from Tomball. Tomball, Texas. Its a small town on the northwest side of Houston. I dont think its as country as people make it seem. Its actually growing. But dont go there without me, man, because theyll take your shoes and all of that. Its a small town. Eleven thousand people, something like that. And I guess thats where it all began for me.\u000A\u000AIt must be a little bit country, since youve picked up an affinity for country style.\u000A\u000AI dont think I got it from there. I think I got it because I wanted to be a country music star at one point in time. Didnt work out too well. Stopped playing guitar. I still sing. Because thats my true calling. This basketball thing is only for, what, I think another year or so. And then I think Im gonna switch over to my singing career.\u000A\u000AReally? Can you sing right now?\u000A\u000AIm sick right now, to tell you the truth, so I cant. My voice isnt up to par. I didnt do my vocal warmups this morning. I havent been drinking my lukewarm tea. Ive been slacking. So, but I will come back and I will sing for the whole office if yall want me to.\u000A\u000AWhats great about country music?\u000A\u000AThe stories that they tell. I just like country because a lot of those guys are from towns that Im maybe from, for one. But also I like how humble they are, and theyre genuine people, I think. Im not saying thatrappers or rock and roll, those people arent. But I just feel like I get along with those guys because theyre fromsmall towns. I just think its cool if you can play the guitar, because I always wanted to play guitar.\u000A\u000AYou tried playing when you were younger?\u000A\u000ANo. I tried it probably about three years ago.\u000A\u000AHow did it go?\u000A\u000AIt went well. I stopped, like, two days into it. But, you know, we dont need to talk about that.\u000A\u000ADid you learn any songs?\u000A\u000AI did. I learned The Star-Spangled Banner, the national anthem. I always wanted to play it before the Bulls game, but I always thought, like, Coach would be like, Youre not focused on the game! So I never really asked.\u000A\u000AMaybe theyll let you sing it.\u000A\u000AYeah. I mean, they should let me sing. I guarantee I wouldnt get booed. As long as I sing it in Chicago.\u000A\u000ATell me how you started to get into the hats and the country style, and obviously the boots that you wear to the arena every game.\u000A\u000AI dont wear them anymore.\u000A\u000AYou dont?\u000A\u000ASince I became part of Team Jordan, I love the Jordan brand, so Im always in a pair of Jordans. I dont wear dress shoes. Its not me. I dont like neckties. Every once in a while, but its just really not me. But I think that Jordans are what youd find me in the majority of the time now, just because they send so many of them. They show a lot of love to the athlete.\u000A\u000ADo you still have a lot of pairs of cowboy boots?\u000A\u000AI do, yeah. I still got the boots in my closet. I look at them every now and then. I dust them off. I remember those days. But, you know, my fashions changed a little bit too. I dont wear too many boot-cut jeans anymore, with the cowboy belt and belt buckle. You know, its more straight-cut jeans, and jeans with holes in them. So, Ive changed over the years, clothing-wise, I should say.\u000A\u000ADid you ever play ball in cowboy boots?\u000A\u000A[Laughs] Nah, youre setting yourself up for failure. All I did was I walked around in them. And its great, because you can walk in the snow in those bad babies, and itll wipe off. You can\u0027t do that in a pair of Jordans. Yoube mad at the world. SoI got some winterized Jordan boots for the winter.\u000A\u000AWhats your favorite pair of cowboy boots you have?\u000A\u000AProbably, theyre like a brown cowhide, and they have like orange going up the calf. I think Im a fan of colors. Orange isnt my favorite one, but I dont have a problem with orange. Those were the ones I beat, those were the ones I wore the majority of the time when I did wear cowboy boots.\u000A\u000AWhere did you get them?\u000A\u000ADifferent spots. I like Ariat Boots. I think those are very comfortable. And I got a fat foot, and I got bunions, or I got one bunion, kind of, so that helps. That helps with how my foot feels in the boot.\u000A\u000AWhat size are you?\u000A\u000AThirteen, fourteen. On the court, more of a fourteen. Off the court, in almost everything, probably a thirteen.\u000A\u000AThats not so big. So you probably dont have a problem buying shoes.\u000A\u000AI dont really know the last time Ive actually bought a pair of shoes. Ive never had that problem since I became an NBA player. I mean, I just get boxes of shoes from Jordan, and theyre just in my size. Thirteen, fourteen. Whatever I ask for. And thats easy.\u000A\u000AIs it true that you took significantly less money to be on Team Jordan? What led to that decision?\u000A\u000AIve always been a fan of Mike and his game. What he did for the game of basketball as a whole, and what he did off the court for it too, whether it was with Hanes or his shoe brand. But Ive always been a fan of the tennis shoe. So when I got an opportunity to switch from Adidas to Jordan, I just thought it was the right choice, because Ive never had problems with my feet. Im not bashing Adidas at all, but I got turf toe one year and rolled my ankles a few times. Thats never happened, whenever I was at Marquette with Jordan or before that, with Nike. So I thoughtmaybe I should go back to that shoe. And then Jordan picked me up.\u000A\u000AIts not about the money. I do it because I love the game, for one. I think Mike takes care of his players. Hes always saying how this is a Jordan family. Everybodys so cool to hang around, and you get a lot of respect, within that Jordan brand, to each and every individual, because youre significantly really good at your particular sport. So, I think it was an easy choice, moving on to Jordan.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADid any of your Adidas-wearing teammates [like Derrick Rose] try to convince you to stay on Adidas?\u000A\u000ANo. No. You cant convince me, once my minds made up. They already knew. I was probably telling them halfway through the season, whenever it is, When this years over, yall can count on not seeing me in Adidas. Im gonna be straight Jordan-ed out. Now Im never wanting to leave Brand Jordan.\u000A\u000ANow that youre at Jordan, whats it like to have every kids dream come true of access to all the Jordans, all the time? Whats that like, to have just any Jordan you want?\u000A\u000AOh my gosh, its crazy! Like, youll just get packages in the mail with just hella shoes, hella gear. Youre just like, man! You open it, you just see the Jumpman logo, youre like, Im really part of Team Jordan right now!\u000A\u000AGrowing up, did you have a favorite pair of Jordans? And do you have them now?\u000A\u000AYeah. I do have them now. Growing up, my favorite Jordan was probably the Ten, just because they look good, if you were to walk around in them, and they feel decent to play basketball in. So it was like the best of both worlds right there. And it was the all black ones, just because black goes with, like, everything. So I probably got about three or four of those at the house right now, just because that was my all-time favorite one. And then the Space Jam, the black Eleven.\u000A\u000AIs there a pair that you play in more than any other pair?\u000A\u000AI play in, like, 29s, 28s. The newest stuff. Because thats made for todays game. I think that the retros are more to walk around in now. And the retros was MJs stuff, so I let MJ wear the sneakers he wore now, and Ill stick to the nowadays stuff.\u000A\u000AHave you ever considered breaking out a pair of Ones for game time?\u000A\u000AOnes?! No! No, not Ones. Maybe, like, some Threes or some Fives or some Tens. Ones! No! I cant hoop in Ones.\u000A\u000AWhat do you think about Nate Robinson and Nick Young wearing Air Yeezys or Supreme Foamposites on the court?\u000A\u000AThe Yeezy is not a basketball sneaker! I cant. I couldnt do it, because I know how my feet are. Those shoes are heavier than the ones that Jordan makes now, because of the changing technology. I think theyre great shoes. I mean, hell, I love them. I wear them all the time. But not to hoop in. No. If Im hooping, I need some 29s. I need some Superfly Threes. The Superfly Fours that have come out are really nice. So that might be the sneaker for me.\u000A\u000AStyle is a big part of the NBA community nowadays. Who do you think is super well dressed in the league?\u000A\u000AI think people dress well all over our league, to tell you the truth. When you see them walking to the arena, they represent themselves well, along with their organization. I think that you cant pick just one guy, because I think a lot of guys have their own style. I mean, you can take notes on a lot of different guys and put it together, but my thing is, Im not a fan of neckties. Im not a fan of dress shoes. So any suit that I wear, probably a hundred and ten percent going to have Jordans on. I cant stand neckties, so I wear the collarless button-ups, Mandarin collars.\u000A\u000AWhich pair of Jordans looks best with a suit?\u000A\u000AOnes. Ones are the waysee, Ones are the way to go with suits. And Tens go great with them. But I think any shoe thats like a narrow shoe looks really good with suits.\u000A\u000AI was watching a video you did for the Bulls where you said you werent planning on cutting your hair anytime soon. Are you still on that path?\u000A\u000AYeah. Im not cutting my hair. Im growing out my beard. Its crazy, because its really getting long. Ive been growing it for almost twenty-six years now. But as far as the hair on the top of my head, yeah, nah, I cant cut it. I think Ive branded it a little bit. My hairs nappy. Im okay with it. I dont got anything to hide. Its my hair. I do what I want to do to it.\u000A\u000AIs there anything you do in terms of hair care?\u000A\u000AI just, you know, wash it, go to sleep, get up, and go. I dont do nothing to it in the morning.\u000A\u000AYou dont push it in any sort of direction? It just does this up thing on its own?\u000A\u000AI dont care how my hair looks. You know, some people like me, people dont. Ill be fine.\u000A\u000AObviously this offseason is going to be a big offseason for you. Youve been very much in the spotlight. Do you feel more pressure to be on your A-game, style-wise?\u000A\u000ANot at all. Im gonna dress the way that I feel like dressing. I think the camera may be on me a little bit more, which is fine. First I gotta get my muscle tone right. So when they put the cameras on me, the ladies is like, Ooh, look at him! But other than that, man, Im gonna keep doing what Ive been doing. I think its worked for me thus far. I wont change it too much. I like where Im at in my wardrobe and fashion-wise.\u000A\u000AIn general, how does it feel to be one of the biggest free agents this offseason?\u000A\u000AIts amazing. All you ever wanted to do in life, in a sport and whatever it is, is to feel wanted. I feel like a lot of teams could potentially use me on their roster, you know what I mean? So I think thats the most fun part, knowing that this team could use me, or this team or that team. And obviously the Bulls. So being a free agent, being I guess one of the hottest ones right now, thats a blessing. I gotta take it. I gotta run with it. I cant just settle. I gotta continue to get better. Thats what the summers for.\u000A\u000ALast offseason, you could have taken a contract extension with the Bulls, but you opted to improve yourself this season. Obviously its worked out really well for you. But what led to that decision?\u000A\u000AI was very comfortable in making that decision, because I know the amount of work that I put in thatsummer, Ive never done that before. Like, Ive always worked hard, but Ive always been a player that just, I just played harder than everybody. I was tougher than everybody. I never really worked on my craft, my bar hand, my jump shot. It was always like, just play hard, dive, take charges, whatever it may be. But Iactually worked on my game, and I felt it. I felt like a different player. I was comfortable whenever I got the ball in a certain position. Now its all about perfecting this craft that I love.\u000A\u000AYoure well known for being great on defense. Do you feel that gives you a major advantage because of the general emphasis on offense in the game today?\u000A\u000ADefinitely. I think theres a lot of guys in this league that can score. I mean, we have prolific scorers in this league. You gotta have guys on your team that are willing to step up to that competition and try to lock that man down. I take pride in that, being able to guard the opposing teams best player, being good on there, and attempt to produce on offense. I think thats what this game is all about, man, is giving your all on both ends of the floor. So I pride myself on that. And hopefully Ill keep that up.\u000A\u000AI think a lot of kids want to know: whats it like to guard LeBron James?\u000A\u000AI mean, the dudes a great player. I think everybody knows that. But when you face him, you just got a battle. I mean, you gotta compete. And he tips his hat to guys who dont back down. I think a lot of guys around the league respect guys that can guard the likes of James Harden or LeBron or Carmelo. You know, all those guys. KD, all those guys. If you can stick with them for however many minutes youre playing, guys like, man, thats a tough task, because those guys will just flat out score the ball. And, you know, you go back to the whole LeBron thing, I mean, the dudes a great player. But my thing is, just make everything hard for him. Just get in his face. It works sometimes. Sometimes it doesnt. I think thats part of the game. I think good offense beats good defense every time.\u000A\u000ALike a Dirk Nowtizki fadeaway.\u000A\u000AOff one foot. Like, you can guard that to the best of your abilities, but because he is seven feet and shooting the ball off one foot, its a good offense for him. If the ball goes in, you cant be mad at that. So, good offense beats good defense every time.\u000A\u000AAre there any talks of a Jimmy Butler signature shoe?\u000A\u000AI gotta make my name in this league first. As soon as that happens, then I can, you know, try to talk Mike into it.\u000A\u000ADo you have any dream designs?\u000A\u000ANever thought about it, to tell you the truth. I never thought that Id be with Team Jordan growing up! So, hell, I think my own shoe is a little bit farfetched. Im not saying it wont happen. But, well, Ill just stick with being on Team Jordan for now.",

season, some people thought Jimmy Butler was making a big gamble on his career after deciding to not sign an extension with the Chicago Bulls. As a relatively unproven player, it seemed like the potential downside far outweighed any upside. But by the time the season ended, it was clear he&#x2019;d bet correctly. Not only did Butler make the All-Star team and emerge as one of the NBA&#x2019;s best two-way players, but he asserted himself as arguably the Bulls&#x2019; leader down the stretch. (And remember, this is the same team that has former MVP Derrick Rose on its roster.)</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.2">A lot of hard work went into making Jimmy the player he was this season, but hey, maybe he owes a little bit to the shoes. Before the 2014-15 season he announced that he had left Adidas to sign with Jordan brand after sitting out a portion of the previous season with turf toe. And while the new contract he&#x2019;ll get this offseason, whatever city it lands him in, is set to pay him handsomely (potentially $16 million/year handsomely), his endorsement deal with Jordan brand was for <a href="http://sneakernews.com/2015/05/27/jimmy-butler-drops-adidas-and-a-huge-paycheck-to-wear-jordans/">reportedly 75% less </a>than he was making at Adidas, something that&#x2019;s unheard of in the NBA or any professional sport.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.3">His differences from the average player don&#x2019;t end there. He admits his style has changed recently, but until then Jimmy Butler&#x2019;s been most known as maybe the only NBA player to truly love country music, and furthermore, country style. Before signing with Jordan, he would even wear cowboy boots to the arena before every game. You put all that together, and it&#x2019;s easy to see why every team in the NBA sees him as the league&#x2019;s next superstar. Here, we talked to Jimmy about country music style, leaving Adidas for Jordan, and what it&#x2019;s like to be one of the most coveted players this offseason.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Tell us where youre from, and a little bit about yourself. Youre from Houston, right?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.6">Ah, dont do that. Im from Tomball. Lets just get that straight away. Im from Tomball. Tomball, Texas. Its a small town on the northwest side of Houston. I dont think its as country as people make it seem. Its actually growing. But dont go there without me, man, because theyll take your shoes and all of that. Its a small town. Eleven thousand people, something like that. And I guess thats where it all began for me.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>It must be a little bit country, since youve picked up an affinity for country style.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.8">I dont think I got it from there. I think I got it because I wanted to be a country music star at one point in time. Didnt work out too well. Stopped playing guitar. I still sing. Because thats my true calling. This basketball thing is only for, what, I think another year or so. And then I think Im gonna switch over to my singing career.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>Really? Can you sing right now?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.a">Im sick right now, to tell you the truth, so I cant. My voice isnt up to par. I didnt do my vocal warmups this morning. I havent been drinking my lukewarm tea. Ive been slacking. So, but I will come back and I will sing for the whole office if yall want me to.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Whats great about country music?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.c">The stories that they tell. I just like country because a lot of those guys are from towns that Im maybe from, for one. But also I like how humble they are, and theyre genuine people, I think. Im not saying thatrappers or rock and roll, those people arent. But I just feel like I get along with those guys because theyre fromsmall towns. I just think its cool if you can play the guitar, because I always wanted to play guitar.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>You tried playing when you were younger?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.e">No. I tried it probably about three years ago.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>How did it go?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.g">It went well. I stopped, like, two days into it. But, you know, we dont need to talk about that.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>Did you learn any songs?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.i">I did. I learned The Star-Spangled Banner, the national anthem. I always wanted to play it before the Bulls game, but I always thought, like, Coach would be like, Youre not focused on the game! So I never really asked.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>Maybe theyll let you sing it.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.k">Yeah. I mean, they should let me sing. I guarantee I wouldnt get booed. As long as I sing it in Chicago.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>Tell me how you started to get into the hats and the country style, and obviously the boots that you wear to the arena every game.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.m">I dont wear them anymore.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>You dont?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.o">Since I became part of Team Jordan, I love the Jordan brand, so Im always in a pair of Jordans. I dont wear dress shoes. Its not me. I dont like neckties. Every once in a while, but its just really not me. But I think that Jordans are what youd find me in the majority of the time now, just because they send so many of them. They show a lot of love to the athlete.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>Do you still have a lot of pairs of cowboy boots?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.q">I do, yeah. I still got the boots in my closet. I look at them every now and then. I dust them off. I remember those days. But, you know, my fashions changed a little bit too. I dont wear too many boot-cut jeans anymore, with the cowboy belt and belt buckle. You know, its more straight-cut jeans, and jeans with holes in them. So, Ive changed over the years, clothing-wise, I should say.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>Did you ever play ball in cowboy boots?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.s">[Laughs] Nah, youre setting yourself up for failure. All I did was I walked around in them. And its great, because you can walk in the snow in those bad babies, and itll wipe off. You can&#x2019;t do that in a pair of Jordans. Yoube mad at the world. SoI got some winterized Jordan boots for the winter.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>Whats your favorite pair of cowboy boots you have?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.u">Probably, theyre like a brown cowhide, and they have like orange going up the calf. I think Im a fan of colors. Orange isnt my favorite one, but I dont have a problem with orange. Those were the ones I beat, those were the ones I wore the majority of the time when I did wear cowboy boots.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>Where did you get them?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.w">Different spots. I like Ariat Boots. I think those are very comfortable. And I got a fat foot, and I got bunions, or I got one bunion, kind of, so that helps. That helps with how my foot feels in the boot.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>What size are you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.y">Thirteen, fourteen. On the court, more of a fourteen. Off the court, in almost everything, probably a thirteen.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>Thats not <em>so </em>big. So you probably dont have a problem buying shoes.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.10">I dont really know the last time Ive actually bought a pair of shoes. Ive never had that problem since I became an NBA player. I mean, I just get boxes of shoes from Jordan, and theyre just in my size. Thirteen, fourteen. Whatever I ask for. And thats easy.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong>Is it true that you took significantly less money to be on Team Jordan? What led to that decision?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.12">Ive always been a fan of Mike and his game. What he did for the game of basketball as a whole, and what he did off the court for it too, whether it was with Hanes or his shoe brand. But Ive always been a fan of the tennis shoe. So when I got an opportunity to switch from Adidas to Jordan, I just thought it was the right choice, because Ive never had problems with my feet. Im not bashing Adidas at all, but I got turf toe one year and rolled my ankles a few times. Thats never happened, whenever I was at Marquette with Jordan or before that, with Nike. So I thoughtmaybe I should go back to that shoe. And then Jordan picked me up.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.13">Its not about the money. I do it because I love the game, for one. I think Mike takes care of his players. Hes always saying how this is a Jordan family. Everybodys so cool to hang around, and you get a lot of respect, within that Jordan brand, to each and every individual, because youre significantly really good at your particular sport. So, I think it was an easy choice, moving on to Jordan.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.14"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5590fdde9a4ccca62f9b5f92/master/w_768/style-blogs-the-gq-eye-jimmyspacejam.jpg" alt="style-blogs-the-gq-eye-jimmyspacejam.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-butler-bulls-interview-adidas-jordan-lebron&amp;t=style-blogs-the-gq-eye-jimmyspacejam.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-butler-bulls-interview-adidas-jordan-lebron&amp;t=style-blogs-the-gq-eye-jimmyspacejam.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-butler-bulls-interview-adidas-jordan-lebron&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5590fdde9a4ccca62f9b5f92%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-blogs-the-gq-eye-jimmyspacejam.jpg&amp;description=style-blogs-the-gq-eye-jimmyspacejam.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjimmy-butler-bulls-interview-adidas-jordan-lebron&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5590fdde9a4ccca62f9b5f92%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-blogs-the-gq-eye-jimmyspacejam.jpg&amp;description=style-blogs-the-gq-eye-jimmyspacejam.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>Did any of your Adidas-wearing teammates [like Derrick Rose] try to convince you to stay on Adidas?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.16">No. No. You cant convince me, once my minds made up. They already knew. I was probably telling them halfway through the season, whenever it is, When this years over, yall can count on not seeing me in Adidas. Im gonna be straight Jordan-ed out. Now Im never wanting to leave Brand Jordan.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.17"><strong>Now that youre at Jordan, whats it like to have every kids dream come true of access to all the Jordans, all the time? Whats that like, to have just any Jordan you want?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.18">Oh my gosh, its crazy! Like, youll just get packages in the mail with just hella shoes, hella gear. Youre just like, man! You open it, you just see the Jumpman logo, youre like, Im really part of Team Jordan right now!</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.19"><strong>Growing up, did you have a favorite pair of Jordans? And do you have them now?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1a">Yeah. I do have them now. Growing up, my favorite Jordan was probably the Ten, just because they look good, if you were to walk around in them, and they feel decent to play basketball in. So it was like the best of both worlds right there. And it was the all black ones, just because black goes with, like, everything. So I probably got about three or four of those at the house right now, just because that was my all-time favorite one. And then the Space Jam, the black Eleven.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><strong>Is there a pair that you play in more than any other pair?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1c">I play in, like, 29s, 28s. The newest stuff. Because thats made for todays game. I think that the retros are more to walk around in now. And the retros was MJs stuff, so I let MJ wear the sneakers he wore now, and Ill stick to the nowadays stuff.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><strong>Have you ever considered breaking out a pair of Ones for game time?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1e">Ones?! No! No, not Ones. Maybe, like, some Threes or some Fives or some Tens. Ones! No! I cant hoop in Ones.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><strong>What do you think about Nate Robinson and Nick Young wearing <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/nk_wp_media/uploads/2013/03/Corey-Joseph-in-the-Nike-LeBron-X-Prism-and-Nate-Robinson-in-the-Nike-Air-Yeezy-2-Black-Solar-Red.jpg">Air Yeezys</a> or <a href="http://nk_wp_media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2014/04/i-74.jpg">Supreme Foamposites</a> on the court?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1g">The Yeezy is not a basketball sneaker! I cant. I couldnt do it, because I know how my feet are. Those shoes are heavier than the ones that Jordan makes now, because of the changing technology. I think theyre great shoes. I mean, hell, I love them. I wear them all the time. But not to hoop in. No. If Im hooping, I need some 29s. I need some Superfly Threes. The Superfly Fours that have come out are really nice. So that might be the sneaker for me.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><strong>Style is a big part of the NBA community nowadays. Who do you think is super well dressed in the league?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1i">I think people dress well all over our league, to tell you the truth. When you see them walking to the arena, they represent themselves well, along with their organization. I think that you cant pick just one guy, because I think a lot of guys have their own style. I mean, you can take notes on a lot of different guys and put it together, but my thing is, Im not a fan of neckties. Im not a fan of dress shoes. So any suit that I wear, probably a hundred and ten percent going to have Jordans on. I cant stand neckties, so I wear the collarless button-ups, Mandarin collars.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1j"><strong>Which pair of Jordans looks best with a suit?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1k">Ones. Ones are the waysee, Ones are the way to go with suits. And Tens go great with them. But I think any shoe thats like a narrow shoe looks really good with suits.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1l"><strong>I was watching a video you did for the Bulls where you said you werent planning on cutting your hair anytime soon. Are you still on that path?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1m">Yeah. Im not cutting my hair. Im growing out my beard. Its crazy, because its really getting long. Ive been growing it for almost twenty-six years now. But as far as the hair on the top of my head, yeah, nah, I cant cut it. I think Ive branded it a little bit. My hairs nappy. Im okay with it. I dont got anything to hide. Its my hair. I do what I want to do to it.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1n"><strong>Is there anything you do in terms of hair care?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1o">I just, you know, wash it, go to sleep, get up, and go. I dont do nothing to it in the morning.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1p"><strong>You dont push it in any sort of direction? It just does this up thing on its own?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1q">I dont care how my hair looks. You know, some people like me, people dont. Ill be fine.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1r"><strong>Obviously this offseason is going to be a big offseason for you. Youve been very much in the spotlight. Do you feel more pressure to be on your A-game, style-wise?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1s">Not at all. Im gonna dress the way that I feel like dressing. I think the camera may be on me a little bit more, which is fine. First I gotta get my muscle tone right. So when they put the cameras on me, the ladies is like, Ooh, look at him! But other than that, man, Im gonna keep doing what Ive been doing. I think its worked for me thus far. I wont change it too much. I like where Im at in my wardrobe and fashion-wise.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1t"><strong>In general, how does it feel to be one of the biggest free agents this offseason?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1u">Its amazing. All you ever wanted to do in life, in a sport and whatever it is, is to feel wanted. I feel like a lot of teams could potentially use me on their roster, you know what I mean? So I think thats the most fun part, knowing that this team could use me, or this team or that team. And obviously the Bulls. So being a free agent, being I guess one of the hottest ones right now, thats a blessing. I gotta take it. I gotta run with it. I cant just settle. I gotta continue to get better. Thats what the summers for.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1v"><strong>Last offseason, you could have taken a contract extension with the Bulls, but you opted to improve yourself this season. Obviously its worked out really well for you. But what led to that decision?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1w">I was very comfortable in making that decision, because I know the amount of work that I put in thatsummer, Ive never done that before. Like, Ive always worked hard, but Ive always been a player that just, I just played harder than everybody. I was tougher than everybody. I never really worked on my craft, my bar hand, my jump shot. It was always like, just play hard, dive, take charges, whatever it may be. But Iactually worked on my <em>game</em>, and I felt it. I felt like a different player. I was comfortable whenever I got the ball in a certain position. Now its all about perfecting this craft that I love.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1x"><strong>Youre well known for being great on defense. Do you feel that gives you a major advantage because of the general emphasis on offense in the game today?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1y">Definitely. I think theres a lot of guys in this league that can score. I mean, we have prolific scorers in this league. You gotta have guys on your team that are willing to step up to that competition and try to lock that man down. I take pride in that, being able to guard the opposing teams best player, being good on there, and attempt to produce on offense. I think thats what this game is all about, man, is giving your all on both ends of the floor. So I pride myself on that. And hopefully Ill keep that up.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.1z"><strong>I think a lot of kids want to know: whats it like to guard LeBron James?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.20">I mean, the dudes a great player. I think everybody knows that. But when you face him, you just got a battle. I mean, you gotta compete. And he tips his hat to guys who dont back down. I think a lot of guys around the league respect guys that can guard the likes of James Harden or LeBron or Carmelo. You know, all those guys. KD, all those guys. If you can stick with them for however many minutes youre playing, guys like, man, thats a tough task, because those guys will just flat out score the ball. And, you know, you go back to the whole LeBron thing, I mean, the dudes a great player. But my thing is, just make everything hard for him. Just get in his face. It works sometimes. Sometimes it doesnt. I think thats part of the game. I think good offense beats good defense every time.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.21"><strong>Like a Dirk Nowtizki fadeaway.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.22">Off one foot. Like, you can guard that to the best of your abilities, but because he is seven feet and shooting the ball off one foot, its a good offense for him. If the ball goes in, you cant be mad at that. So, good offense beats good defense every time.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.23"><strong>Are there any talks of a Jimmy Butler signature shoe?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.24">I gotta make my name in this league first. As soon as that happens, then I can, you know, try to talk Mike into it.</p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.25"><strong>Do you have any dream designs?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.4.26">Never thought about it, to tell you the truth. I never thought that Id be with Team Jordan growing up! So, hell, I think my own shoe is a little bit farfetched. Im not saying it wont happen. But, well, Ill just stick with being on Team Jordan for now.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".8qpqqm2akg.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col
