  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000APhoto: via Instagram\u000A\u000A Hey. Have you heard that Social Media Has Changed The Way We Live Today? Probably not, since nobody has ever written a trend piece about it! I only know because a toddler whispered it to me on the Q train and then disappeared in a puff of smoke.\u000A\u000ASo, I don\u0027t remember exactly when my boyfriend\u0027s social media started bothering me. In person, he\u0027s silly and fun and human, but on Twitter he comes off as solemn and esoteric. Joyless. He @\u0027s people like Errol Morris with some line of professorial dialogue that uses \u0022w/r/t\u0022 to mean \u0022with regard to.\u0022 He\u0027s never casual or self-deprecating. Instead, he comes off as someone who takes himself way too seriously. (\u0022How many times have you used the word \u0027discourse?\u0027 on Twitter?\u0022 I once asked him. He thought about it for a little too long before finally replying: \u0022No more than ten times...\u0022—which is ten too many times.) He knows it bothers me. But he thinks I\u0027m being too neurotic.\u000A\u000AAnd maybe I am. The last time I brought it up, in that needling way I usually do, he rolled his eyes and said, \u0022It only bothers you because if you look at both our Twitters, it doesn\u0027t seem to make sense that we\u0027re dating.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s right—at least in that my annoyance has more to do with other people\u0027s evaluation of our relationship than it does with his Twitter. Yet it bothers me that from the outside—say, if an ex were to Twitter-stalk myself and my boyfriend—we seem tragically mismatched. Plenty of men my friends and I have dated are bad at texting. The difference is nobody else has access to our iMessages.\u000A\u000ABut if the guy you\u0027re dating is bad on social media, it\u0027s like every \u0022lol what u doin??\u0022 is thrown up on a Jumbotron for public scrutiny. Social media hasn\u0027t changed the game as much as it\u0027s enhanced bad habits we\u0027ve always had, like zeroing in on the flaws of our partners, be they a pre-screened first date or someone whose balls you could oil-paint from memory. While my boyfriend might seem like a pretentious weirdo on social, at least he comes off intelligent and relatively mature, which is preferable to most of the other instances of significant other social media shame that I uncovered.\u000A\u000ATake Abby A., 24, who says that her boyfriend\u0027s social media persona is abrasive enough that their mutual friends rag on him for coming off smug and cocky online. (After being fired from a job, he updated his status on Facebook: \u0022HAHA well GOOD LUCK without me! That should be hilarious!\u0022) She describes his posts as \u0022very middle-school-esque,\u0022 like he needs constant validation from his peers. \u0022I feel like I\u0027m dating a LOL-ing, bragging tween,\u0022 she says. When Abby has tried to point this out, he says that if people read things that way, that\u0027s their problem. This communication breakdown results in passive-aggressive behavior on her end. \u0022I almost always comment \u0027#selfie\u0027 on his selfies,\u0022 she says, thereby throwing him into a hashtag pool of selfie-taking tweens.\u000A\u000ASpeaking of middle school, there are more egregious ways to let your inner horny 14-year-old out on social. Christine, 27, explains that her boyfriend is (for the most part) awesome. He has \u0022normal social media habits like retweeting interesting articles and cute pictures of bears.\u0022 The problem is that he also follows accounts that tweet out pictures of butts and boobs, and, worst of all, occasionally retweets them. \u0022Men are visual creatures,\u0022 she concedes. \u0022If someone\u0027s gonna put her ass on the Internet, they will look.\u0022 But a retweet? Props to Christine for being so understanding.\u000A\u000AThen there are the guys who somehow revert back to college versions of themselves and bro down harder than they do IRL, as in the case of Abby C.\u0027s boyfriend, whose Instagram is mostly \u0022photos that emphasize the large quantity of beers he\u0027s consumed in a short period of time.\u0022 And yet, that\u0027s not even our regressive frat guy\u0027s most frustrating online habit. \u0022He\u0027s a chronic liker,\u0022 says Abby. \u0022If you \u0027like\u0027 everything, then essentially you like nothing.\u0022\u000A\u000AAlthough these women figure their guys\u0027 IRL behavior makes putting up with their web personalities worthwhile, sometimes a bad social media boyfriend is a total deal-breaker. Anisa, 23, was immediately annoyed at the start of her relationship when her ex-boyfriend incessantly sent her Snapchats. (Mostly videos of his face.) \u0022If I\u0027m gonna commit to a 400-second Snapchat story, you better be riding a unicorn or grocery shopping with Jesus,\u0022 she says. His Snapchat habits foreshadowed the self-involvement and oversharing to come. Eventually, says Anisa, he began to subtweet her after one of their arguments: \u0022Every tweet was whiny, unfounded, melodramatic, and full of typos. He was always the victim, and I was always Cruella de Ville.\u0022\u000A\u000APerhaps unsurprisingly, they didn\u0027t last. And that\u0027s mostly because he was a member of the third most pervasive social media personal brand among men: Those Who Have All The Feels. As Michelle K. privately stuck with her ex-boyfriend as he struggled with depression, she noticed that he was simultaneously articulating it on social media with increasing frequency and extremity—a video of him on Tumblr with the caption \u0022a narcisist\u0022; another Tumblr post titled \u0022thing I wrote on a bunch of painkillers\u0022—among other emo-tinged posts befitting a My Chemical Romance fan. Her real-world empathy finally failed her when he tweeted a bunch of comments on social media that denigrated and satirized people who chose to seek professional help or go on medication.\u000A\u000AHe\u0027d say, \u0022Can\u0027t you just try harder?\u0022 or, \u0022[I\u0027m] regulating sanity by buying big bags of those strawberry hard candies you get at the psychiatrist.\u0022 Michelle, who is on anti-depressants herself, stresses: \u0022I\u0027m in total support of people using social media as a way to find community when they\u0027re trying to overcome mental illness, but I\u0027m not in total support of using the tools that some people have to use in order to stay alive just to tell a joke.\u0022 The last straw was when he posted a selfie on the day the Ferguson decision was made.\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t think you can know all the facets of someone from social media,\u0022 Michelle says, \u0022but I do think you can learn a lot about the image someone wants to project.\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027m not sure if she\u0027s right. After talking to all these women, and if I had to purposefully overgeneralize, it looks like—surprise!—men and women use social media differently. Women use it to curate how their lives look like to others, from the early days of Facebook—I distinctly remember going through each party photo with female friends before deciding that each of us looked cute enough to put it up—to Instagrammers who slap a Valencia filter on everything. For better or worse, men seem to underthink rather than overthink how they present themselves on social media. They throw everything on the wall and don\u0027t seem to care what sticks—an utterly unfiltered diary that ends up showcasing their least flattering traits. Sometimes, that includes their enthusiasm for Brazzers.\u000A\u000A",

Instagram</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.2"> Hey. Have you heard that Social Media Has Changed The Way We Live Today? Probably not, since nobody has ever written a trend piece about it! I only know because a toddler whispered it to me on the Q train and then disappeared in a puff of smoke.</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.3">So, I don&apos;t remember exactly when my boyfriend&apos;s social media started bothering me. In person, he&apos;s silly and fun and human, but on Twitter he comes off as solemn and esoteric. Joyless. He @&apos;s people like Errol Morris with some line of professorial dialogue that uses &quot;w/r/t&quot; to mean &quot;with regard to.&quot; He&apos;s never casual or self-deprecating. Instead, he comes off as someone who takes himself way too seriously. (&quot;How many times have you used the word &apos;discourse?&apos; on Twitter?&quot; I once asked him. He thought about it for a little too long before finally replying: &quot;No more than ten times...&quot;&#x2014;which is ten too many times.) He knows it bothers me. But he thinks I&apos;m being too neurotic.</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.5">And maybe I am. The last time I brought it up, in that needling way I usually do, he rolled his eyes and said, &quot;It only bothers you because if you look at both our Twitters, it doesn&apos;t seem to make sense that we&apos;re dating.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.6">He&apos;s right&#x2014;at least in that my annoyance has more to do with other people&apos;s evaluation of our relationship than it does with his Twitter. Yet it bothers me that from the outside&#x2014;say, if an ex were to Twitter-stalk myself and my boyfriend&#x2014;we seem tragically mismatched. Plenty of men my friends and I have dated are bad at texting. The difference is nobody else has access to our iMessages.</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.7">But if the guy you&apos;re dating is bad on social media, it&apos;s like every &quot;lol what u doin??&quot; is thrown up on a Jumbotron for public scrutiny. Social media hasn&apos;t changed the game as much as it&apos;s enhanced bad habits we&apos;ve always had, like zeroing in on the flaws of our partners, be they a pre-screened first date or someone whose balls you could oil-paint from memory. While my boyfriend might seem like a pretentious weirdo on social, at least he comes off intelligent and relatively mature, which is preferable to most of the other instances of significant other social media shame that I uncovered.</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.8">Take Abby A., 24, who says that her boyfriend&apos;s social media persona is abrasive enough that their mutual friends rag on him for coming off smug and cocky online. (After being fired from a job, he updated his status on Facebook: &quot;HAHA well GOOD LUCK without me! That should be hilarious!&quot;) She describes his posts as &quot;very middle-school-esque,&quot; like he needs constant validation from his peers. &quot;I feel like I&apos;m dating a LOL-ing, bragging tween,&quot; she says. When Abby has tried to point this out, he says that if people read things that way, that&apos;s their problem. This communication breakdown results in passive-aggressive behavior on her end. &quot;I almost always comment &apos;#selfie&apos; on his selfies,&quot; she says, thereby throwing him into a hashtag pool of selfie-taking tweens.</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.9">Speaking of middle school, there are more egregious ways to let your inner horny 14-year-old out on social. Christine, 27, explains that her boyfriend is (for the most part) awesome. He has &quot;normal social media habits like retweeting interesting articles and cute pictures of bears.&quot; The problem is that he also follows accounts that tweet out pictures of butts and boobs, and, worst of all, occasionally retweets them. &quot;Men are visual creatures,&quot; she concedes. &quot;If someone&apos;s gonna put her ass on the Internet, they will look.&quot; But a retweet? Props to Christine for being so understanding.</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.a">Then there are the guys who somehow revert back to college versions of themselves and bro down harder than they do IRL, as in the case of Abby C.&apos;s boyfriend, whose Instagram is mostly &quot;photos that emphasize the large quantity of beers he&apos;s consumed in a short period of time.&quot; And yet, that&apos;s not even our regressive frat guy&apos;s most frustrating online habit. &quot;He&apos;s a chronic liker,&quot; says Abby. &quot;If you &apos;like&apos; everything, then essentially you like nothing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.b">Although these women figure their guys&apos; IRL behavior makes putting up with their web personalities worthwhile, sometimes a bad social media boyfriend is a total deal-breaker. Anisa, 23, was immediately annoyed at the start of her relationship when her ex-boyfriend incessantly sent her Snapchats. (Mostly videos of his face.) &quot;If I&apos;m gonna commit to a 400-second Snapchat story, you better be riding a unicorn or grocery shopping with Jesus,&quot; she says. His Snapchat habits foreshadowed the self-involvement and oversharing to come. Eventually, says Anisa, he began to subtweet her after one of their arguments: &quot;Every tweet was whiny, unfounded, melodramatic, and full of typos. He was always the victim, and I was always Cruella de Ville.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.c">Perhaps unsurprisingly, they didn&apos;t last. And that&apos;s mostly because he was a member of the third most pervasive social media personal brand among men: Those Who Have All The Feels. As Michelle K. privately stuck with her ex-boyfriend as he struggled with depression, she noticed that he was simultaneously articulating it on social media with increasing frequency and extremity&#x2014;a video of him on Tumblr with the caption &quot;a narcisist&quot;; another Tumblr post titled &quot;thing I wrote on a bunch of painkillers&quot;&#x2014;among other emo-tinged posts befitting a My Chemical Romance fan. Her real-world empathy finally failed her when he tweeted a bunch of comments on social media that denigrated and satirized people who chose to seek professional help or go on medication.</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.d">He&apos;d say, &quot;Can&apos;t you just try harder?&quot; or, &quot;[I&apos;m] regulating sanity by buying big bags of those strawberry hard candies you get at the psychiatrist.&quot; Michelle, who is on anti-depressants herself, stresses: &quot;I&apos;m in total support of people using social media as a way to find community when they&apos;re trying to overcome mental illness, but I&apos;m not in total support of using the tools that some people have to use in order to stay alive just to tell a joke.&quot; The last straw was when he posted a selfie on the day the Ferguson decision was made.</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.e">&quot;I don&apos;t think you can know all the facets of someone from social media,&quot; Michelle says, &quot;but I do think you can learn a lot about the image someone wants to project.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.f">I&apos;m not sure if she&apos;s right. After talking to all these women, and if I had to purposefully overgeneralize, it looks like&#x2014;surprise!&#x2014;men and women use social media differently. Women use it to curate how their lives look like to others, from the early days of Facebook&#x2014;I distinctly remember going through each party photo with female friends before deciding that each of us looked cute enough to put it up&#x2014;to Instagrammers who slap a Valencia filter on everything. For better or worse, men seem to underthink rather than overthink how they present themselves on social media. They throw everything on the wall and don&apos;t seem to care what sticks&#x2014;an utterly unfiltered diary that ends up showcasing their least flattering traits. Sometimes, that includes their enthusiasm for Brazzers.</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".24wdsx9fqbk.1.1.0.0.4.g"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe
