  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestPhoto: Suzi Pratt/Film Magic/Getty Images\u000A\u000AThey came from many thousands of miles away, some 10,000 of them, from locales as far-flung as Beijing, Bangkok, Berlin, and Boise. They packed face paint, purple spandex, nose rings, homemade scepters, booty skirts, and trail mix. Medieval-style shoulder pads, platform wedges, and Viking helmets with curlicue horns. Trading cards and Converse shoes. Plastic, double-bladed battleaxes. Digital cameras.\u000A\u000AIt would be a lie to say that some of their appearances did not align with our most vulgar preconceptions. Yes, okay, it is true: Among them were the drastically over-and underweight, the sun-starved, the sunken-eyed. Those beset by alopecia and garlanded by prodigious neck beards. Some were adorned with braces at a juncture in life where such possession is considered socially unfortunate. Others smelled sour in the way an old thumb splint smells sour. A few, it would be irresponsible to omit, were dauntingly buff.\u000A\u000AMost, though, were just like you and me: neither tall nor short, thumbing their iPhones, slumped in the practiced, self-conscious way our generation has mastered, outfitted in skinny jeans and hoodies. All of them, with few exceptions, arrived at Seattle\u0027s Key Arena on the weekend of July 18, 2014, with the intention of watching four straight days of competitive video gaming. This was my intention, as well.\u000A\u000AHere\u0027s what I knew going in: On the morning of April 5, 2014, tickets went on sale for \u0022The International 2014\u0022 (TI4), the world championship of the multiplayer online battle arena game DotA (Defense of the Ancients) 2. All 10,000 sold out in less than an hour, and by afternoon, the going price on eBay for a $99 general admission pass had swollen to $500. Meanwhile, the tournament\u0027s prize pool had engorged similarly: Initially set at $1.6 million, it grew, through crowd-sourced contributions, to more than $4 million in about one week. By the time Valve, the game\u0027s developer, closed off donations in mid-July, TI4\u0027s total pot had reached $11 million—a world record.\u000A\u000AThe previous year had supplied an equally eye-popping array of news bits from the world of competitive gaming, or \u0022e-sports\u0022—the sorts of facts that make you wonder whether you hadn\u0027t accidentally overslept by about 150 years. In August of 2013, the United States\u0027 Citizenship and Immigration Services granted its first gamer-specific athletic visa to a Canadian League of Legends player named Danny Le. Five months after that, The Wall Street Journal announced that Twitch TV, an e-sports streaming site (that is, a site for watching other people play video games competitively) ranked third in peak Internet traffic, beating out Facebook, Hulu, Amazon, and Pandora. (Amazon recently bought Twitch for just shy of $1 billion.) And just one month before the horde of fans descended on Seattle, a college in Chicago declared it would begin granting athletic scholarships to e-sports athletes. There would be about sixty of them per year, each worth approximately $19,000.\u000A\u000AHere\u0027s what I was hoping to find out: Who, save the most direly mal-aligned, would endure the costs and inconveniences of travelling to a different country (or city, even) to watch players manipulate avatars on a screen the size of a hockey rink? Who were these world-class players competing for such a bloated prize purse? When, exactly, was it decided that video games were worthy of the same fevered allegiances and rituals we lend to our traditional sports? And, finally, what sort of peculiarities might one witness at the highest-paying e-sports showdown of all time?\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AThe first TI4 lanyards materialize, as if by magic, on the train from SeaTac International Airport to the city\u0027s downtown. They dangle, purple and velvety, from the necks of four affable-looking young men I immediately estimate to be a) in their late teens and b) multi-generationally Midwestern. Even in my post-flight, sleep-deprived stupor, I develop a strong hunch that these guys know their stuff. For one thing, they bicker with military concision about the previous year\u0027s outcome, exchanging a pitter-patter of acronyms, names, statistics, and scoffs. Their clothing, too, is a giveaway: One wears a limited edition DotA T-shirt, and his lanyard is already dotted with a couple of Beanie Baby-style plush characters. The others twirl DotA-branded Sharpie markers and sport black TI4 \u0022Livestrong\u0022-style bracelets. Their discussion is impassioned, intelligent-sounding, and profoundly incomprehensible. I introduce myself and, almost immediately thereafter, beg for a crash course.\u000A\u000AThe quartet comprises four-fifths of \u0022Scoots Canoe,\u0022 a respectably skilled (though very much non-professional) DotA 2 team based in Omaha, Nebraska. Two are brothers: Martin Gilgenast, 18, is around six feet, round-featured and handsome. Thomas, four years his elder, is a bit shorter, with a kind smile and a crisp dollop of blond hair. Between them sits Nathan Davis, a lanky 18-year-old who perpetually jiggles one leg and is, for my money, a dead ringer for \u0022Where\u0027s Waldo?,\u0022 sans glasses.\u000A\u000AMichael Tritz, a 20-year-old with rimless spectacles and a sand-colored ponytail, sits next to me. He takes the first crack at explaining the game. \u0022It\u0027s a steep learning curve,\u0022 he begins. Unlike the real-time strategy games from which it was first developed, \u0022DotA is more complicated, and easier to lose at if you\u0027re bad.\u0022\u000A\u000AEach team of five players begins by drafting a roster of \u0022heroes\u0022—characters that possess a variety of attacks and skills. These heroes start out weak, then engage in a series of small battles to level up their resources and abilities. The beginning of the game finds both teams positioned on opposite corners of a tree-dotted map. They battle for territory until one team is able to destroy a central structure at the heart of the other\u0027s base. Games tend to last between thirty to forty minutes, but they can be much shorter or longer, depending on the style of play. Some Chinese teams, for example, have a reputation for the sort of quick-strike aggression that upends opponents in about fifteen minutes. When a team is beat, its five members use the game\u0027s live chat function to congratulate their competition. Their messages—\u0022gg,\u0022 for \u0022good game\u0022—appear onscreen in rapid succession. They denote surrender and feel, at times, complexly passive-aggressive. \u000A\u000AGot all that? It\u0027s essentially the barest-bones description there is. In truth, things are exponentially more complicated. Because each game presents the ten players with a total of 102 heroes to choose from during the selection period, it\u0027s not enough that a serious DotA player simply master one avatar; he or she must possess a working knowledge of dozens of them, along with a sense of which one might serve as an appropriate response to an opposing player\u0027s choice. An analogue in conventional sports—\u0022physical sports,\u0022 as e-sports fans like to call them—would be something like drafting, assembling, conditioning and coaching a full basketball team, all within about half an hour.\u000A\u000AAs the Nebraskans and I exit the train and begin walking through downtown, I\u0027m suddenly rocked by the realization that I have no idea what to expect when we arrive at TI4. I\u0027ve never played DotA before—I haven\u0027t even picked up a video game controller in two years. And Michael\u0027s explanation of the game, though exceedingly patient, had made an intricate ruin of my notes.\u000A\u000AHoping to start small, I asked them what sort of people I\u0027ll likely be running into at this event.\u000A\u000AMichael smirks. \u0022Males between the ages of 15 and 30,\u0022 he says. \u0022And then some above.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ve seen some women,\u0022 Nathan shoots back defensively. \u0022Maybe seven to eight percent.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe glances back at me with a kindergarten teacher\u0027s patience. \u0022If they look like a character from the game, they\u0027re doing that on purpose.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AIt is one thing to discuss DotA 2, with its kaleidoscopic strategies and variables, in a controlled setting with four patient Nebraskans. It is something else entirely to behold it projected onto an eighty-foot screen—its teams enclosed in matching soundproof cases onstage, its audio effects amplified to the point of near cruelty, its fans shrieking and spilling their jumbo tubs of popcorn down the back of your shirt. When I\u0027d been warned that DotA was an immensely complex game for a beginner to understand, I should have appreciated the sheer profundity of that understatement. Everyone around me seems to gasp, boo and erupt with delighted applause as if obeying a series of familiar cues. My experience, meanwhile, is a queasy hallucination of roars, fireballs, spells, graphs and technical gibberish.\u000A\u000AThis is why, early on the tournament\u0027s second day, I find myself in the Key Arena\u0027s basement-level pressroom, sourly dejected and inhaling complimentary mini-Snickers bars. For much of the morning, I\u0027d been glued to the \u0022Noob Stream\u0022—a Twitch TV webcast of TI4, overlaid with commentary geared toward newbies, or \u0022noobs.\u0022 Despite its hosts\u0027 frequent tangents—\u0022What a sneaky guy this guy is! I wouldn\u0027t let him date my sister, that\u0027s for sure!\u0022—the Noob Stream has turned out to be a major lifeline. It supplies just the sort of dumbed-down synopses I need to begin understanding the game\u0027s teams, heroes, and strategies.\u000A\u000AThe purest expertise, though, emanates from the industry journalists nearby. Since arriving, I\u0027d seen them ducking in and out of the pressroom, cracking Mountain Dews and firing off the same buzzwords the Nebraskans had recited on the train. They all seem to know each other, and their interactions feel at once jocular and world-weary. As far as e-sports go, most are veterans of the big events: Sweden\u0027s \u0022DreamHack,\u0022 Frankfurt\u0027s \u0022ESL One,\u0022 all the U.S.-based \u0022Major League Gaming\u0022 stuff. Yet among them, there\u0027s a sense that TI4 feels distinct.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ve seen some pretty big venues, but this is on a different level,\u0022 says Andrew Campbell, an L.A.-based DotA 2 commentator with a booming voice and a squid-like flop of brown dreadlocks. He wears a well-tailored button-up shirt, brown dress shoes and a pair of skintight DotA leggings. \u0022It\u0027s this intangible electricity. It doesn\u0027t translate to camera—you can see the shot, and it\u0027s like, \u0027That\u0027s cool, people are going wild.\u0027 But feeling the rumble of everyone cheering for their favorite team—to me, it really legitimizes what I\u0027ve been doing for the last three years.\u0022\u000A\u000AThree years may feel like a long time to devote to video games, but it\u0027s really just a small sliver of e-sports\u0027 history. Indeed, competitive gaming has been part of the U.S.\u0027s public conversation since at least 1982, when Starcade, an arcade-themed game show, first debuted on WTBS. Briefly hosted by Alex Trebek, it ran two seasons and pitted competitors against each other on the era\u0027s bulky kiosks. Later, after console purveyors like Nintendo and Sega replaced traditional arcades, gamers would photograph their high scores and mail them back to the companies as proof. Sega and Nintendo, in turn, would submit these scores for publication to industry magazines, which fans would collect and analyze.\u000A\u000AThe development in the 1990s of first-person shooters like Doom and Quake yielded more breakthroughs. Suddenly, players could compete directly against hundreds of others, either through local area networks (LANs) or dial-up connections. In 1997, the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) featured a Quake tournament called \u0022Red Annihilation.\u0022 Its grand prize was a 1987 Ferrari, once owned by the Quake developer John Carmack. (Dennis Fong, the Bay Area-based competitor who won it, later displayed it in the office of his own game company, Gamers Extreme.) The same year, a former investment banker named Angel Munoz founded the Cyberathlete Professional League, believed by many to be the first true e-sports organization. Its inaugural tournament, which took place in Dallas and featured about 400 individuals, had a prize pool of roughly $3,500.\u000A\u000AWhen League of Legends, the most widely-played e-sport in the world, held its last world championship in August of 2013, 32 million people tuned in online—an increase from just 8.2 million the year before, and more than twice the amount of people who watched the 2013 World Series. The Grand Finals of TI4, I\u0027m told by the industry journos, will be aired on ESPN2. Its $10 million prize pool, with $5 million for first place, will make a millionaire out of each of the winning team\u0027s members. For context: Just a year ago, when TI3 took place in Seattle\u0027s Benaroya Hall, it sat only 2,500 people. Its prize pool, the largest in e-sports history at the time, was $2.8 million. \u000A\u000A\u0022The \u0027Chicken Little\u0027 phase is finally over,\u0022 explains Cody Conners, a former e-sports manager-turned industry blogger. \u0022When I started, I\u0027d go to bars and I\u0027d lie about what I did. If someone asked me what I did, I\u0027d say \u0027I work in tech\u0027—which isn\u0027t necessarily a lie, but I wasn\u0027t telling the entirety of the truth. And I feel like now, you have to explain to me why this isn\u0027t a real big thing.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFoolishly, I\u0027d thought that the possession of a TI4 press pass was a carte blanche for exploring every crag and cranny of the Key Arena—floor seats, announcers\u0027 boxes, athletes\u0027 quarters, etc. Emboldened by the Noob Stream, I\u0027d even sketched a rough reporting plan for my second day at TI4. Phase 1: Duck into the players\u0027 lounge and sip a $17 bubblegum daiquiri. Phase 2: Surreptitiously document strategies and juicy inter-team dramas. Phase 3: Retreat to the pressroom and analyze my findings with the other journos. Phase 4: Feast on Corn Nuts and bite-sized Krackel bars while bathing in the respect my impetuous gumshoeing had awarded.\u000A\u000AThis, like so many of the plots I\u0027d had about the tournament, turns out to be grossly misinformed. Moments after ascending the staircase to the arena\u0027s lounge level, I\u0027m neutralized by a Valve employee prowling the area on a Razor scooter. She\u0027d coasted up behind me noiselessly, and I do a full-body flinch when she calls out.\u000A\u000A\u0022Hey there! Are you a player?\u0022 Her smile is polite but firm; she\u0027s undoubtedly certain of the answer.\u000A\u000A\u0022Umm…no. No, I\u0027m press,\u0022 I say, fumbling with my lanyard. \u000A\u000A\u0022Right. So this is the lounge level. It\u0027s for players and managers only.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Yes, but I\u0027ve got this…\u0022\u000A\u000ABefore I can even begin to build a case, she whooshes away on her scooter, speaking quietly into her walkie-talkie and glancing back at me. I begin to realize that showing up at the Key with the intention of obtaining long, introspective player interviews a bit like strutting into at Yankee Stadium, never having watched baseball, and asking for a one-on-one with Derek Jeter. I\u0027d need to regroup.\u000A\u000AMiraculously, I manage to wheedle a sit-down with Alex Garfield, the CEO of Evil Geniuses, a well-renowned American team that\u0027s made it to the tournament\u0027s semi-final round. If I can\u0027t embed with the players in the midst of this high stakes digi-drama, perhaps I can at least learn of their travails secondhand.\u000A\u000AGarfield, a former classical violinist, speaks with the measured patience of someone accustomed to explaining his job in terms that would satisfy a four-year-old. He began his e-sports career in college, when he fronted a Canadian Counter-Strike team $1,000 to compete in a Dallas tournament. They won second place, and he never looked back. Today, Evil Geniuses is a multi-million dollar company with more than a dozen employees and close to 50 players across a handful of games.\u000A\u000AI\u0027m eager to know how the players are reacting to the tournament\u0027s increased size, exposure and pressures. Each morning, they arrive in chauffeured limousines, at private entrances, as admirers jostle and shout. I\u0027d seen a few try to score nachos or a corndog at one of the arena\u0027s concession stands, only to be swarmed by fans looking for photographs. And once, when I was eating personal pizzas with the Nebraskans, Nathan dashed off to acquire an autograph from one of his favorite Chinese stars. His attempt, and the player\u0027s awkward rejection, stuck out as the tournament\u0027s single most heartbreaking moment thus far.\u000A\u000A\u0022How scalable is it when you get from a 1,000 or 2,000-person event to a 10,000-person event where every single fan, or a lot of those fans at the event, feel very close to their celebrities—much closer than they might feel to their favorite basketball player?\u0022 Garfield says. Often, fans develop relationships to e-sports stars through livestreams in which the players talk about everything from strategy to family issues to their love lives. It\u0027s easy to feel like you know them, to forget that they\u0027re actually addressing thousands—sometimes millions—of people.\u000A\u000A\u0022If everybody watching player X\u0027s stream really feels like they\u0027re his best friend,\u0022 Garfield continues, \u0022you\u0027re going to have that many people coming and seeing that they have to share them.\u0022\u000A\u000AAs he talks, a Chinese team ducks out of the roped-off exit behind us. They form a loose circle, smoking cigarettes and strategizing about their next match. Thirty feet away, behind a waist-high barrier, a small crowd begins to form. They elbow each other in the ribs and snap iPhone photos. A few begin to shout over to the players, trying to get them to look. The players pretend to not notice.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AThe tournament\u0027s Grand Finals kick off at around 10 a.m. on Monday, and are a frenzied, fascinating affair. Very few fans seem keen on returning to their nine-to-fives; if anything, the arena feels more packed and kinetic than it has all weekend. With a DotA expertise that\u0027s now hovering somewhere between \u0022unfortunate\u0022 and \u0022tolerable,\u0022 I decide it\u0027s time to graduate from the Noob Stream and join the rest of the masses above ground. It takes me about 35 minutes to find the Nebraskans and stumble across a row of polite fans to take a seat among them.\u000A\u000AThe two remaining teams, Vici Gaming and Newbee, are both Chinese—and both renowned for their abrupt, bombastic gameplay. The day before, Vici had ousted Garfield\u0027s Evil Geniuses in a rapid blitzkrieg. Newbee, meanwhile, had fought its way to the winners bracket in earlier competitions. It appeared to be anyone\u0027s game.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s going to be pretty explosive,\u0022 Michael says as I sit down, my pockets bulging with a final raid of the pressroom\u0027s goodies. \u0022It should be over pretty quick. Neither of these teams is drafting for a late game strategy.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s correct. The games are warp-speed. I could spend a paragraph or two here explaining what I saw—Vici\u0027s early lead, Newbee\u0027s sneaky and masterful comeback, the Nebraskans\u0027 exasperated reaction when someone behind us screams, \u0022Time for the YOLO push!!\u0022 But if I\u0027m being honest, even my best attempts at explication would be offensive to true e-sports adherents.\u000A\u000ASo suffice it to say that when Newbee takes the grand final—along with $5,028,038—a series of cannons erupts directly behind them. Purple confetti flits through the air, and a blinding spritz of sparks shoots upward from the stage. The crowd is on their feet, yours truly included, chanting \u0022Newbee! Newbee! Newbee!\u0022, and the whole place smells like gunpowder, popcorn, Twizzlers, and body odor. This is the closest it\u0027s felt to an athletic event all weekend. Which is to say, only kind of close.\u000A\u000AAs an announcer attempts to congratulate Newbee through the assistance of a translator, I ask the Nebraskans what they thought of T14 spageantry. Are they planning on doing it all again next year?\u000A\u000A\u0022He\u0027s going to Richmond, he\u0027s going to Boston, I\u0027m staying in Omaha, he\u0027s going to Philadelphia for grad school,\u0022 Michael says, pointing to his friends. \u0022So we\u0027ll be splitting up after this. It is cool that we could come and do this together, you know, because DotA is a lot of how we became friends in the first place.\u0022\u000A\u000AThey all reflect for a moment, as if this realization had just hit them. Then we file out.\u000A\u000AAfter parting ways with the Nebraskans, I consider trying to finesse my way into a players\u0027 afterparty I\u0027d heard about. But even after a full weekend of interviews and friendly banter with the industry journos, I can\u0027t imagine who\u0027d let me in. (Some of the industry journos had, for their part, been grumbling about not being invited.) Plus, I\u0027m tired in the way eating peanut butter crackers and candy all weekend makes one tired. I don\u0027t feel the sort of giddy lucidity I often experience after seeing a live sports game. I feel groggy and slightly sad—like I\u0027m stumbling out of a movie theater in the middle of the day.\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t try to hunt down Newbee, the quintet of newly minted millionaires who just set a Guinness World Record. I don\u0027t push into the autograph lines that are forming—around players, announcers, even some of the industry journos. I don\u0027t look for Alex Garfield, whose Evil Geniuses took third place, and $1,038,455 in prize money.\u000A\u000AInstead, I stuff my lanyard into my backpack and head to the Space Needle. Like the other tourists.",

far-flung as Beijing, Bangkok, Berlin, and Boise. They packed face paint, purple spandex, nose rings, homemade scepters, booty skirts, and trail mix. Medieval-style shoulder pads, platform wedges, and Viking helmets with curlicue horns. Trading cards and Converse shoes. Plastic, double-bladed battleaxes. Digital cameras.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.2">It would be a lie to say that some of their appearances did not align with our most vulgar preconceptions. Yes, okay, it is true: Among them were the drastically over-and underweight, the sun-starved, the sunken-eyed. Those beset by alopecia and garlanded by prodigious neck beards. Some were adorned with braces at a juncture in life where such possession is considered socially unfortunate. Others smelled sour in the way an old thumb splint smells sour. A few, it would be irresponsible to omit, were dauntingly buff.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.3">Most, though, were just like you and me: neither tall nor short, thumbing their iPhones, slumped in the practiced, self-conscious way our generation has mastered, outfitted in skinny jeans and hoodies. All of them, with few exceptions, arrived at Seattle&apos;s Key Arena on the weekend of July 18, 2014, with the intention of watching four straight days of competitive video gaming. This was my intention, as well.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.5">Here&apos;s what I knew going in: On the morning of April 5, 2014, tickets went on sale for &quot;The International 2014&quot; (TI4), the world championship of the multiplayer online battle arena game DotA (Defense of the Ancients) 2. All 10,000 sold out in less than an hour, and by afternoon, the going price on eBay for a $99 general admission pass had swollen to $500. Meanwhile, the tournament&apos;s prize pool had engorged similarly: Initially set at $1.6 million, it grew, through crowd-sourced contributions, to more than $4 million in about one week. By the time Valve, the game&apos;s developer, closed off donations in mid-July, TI4&apos;s total pot had reached $11 million&#x2014;a world record.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.6">The previous year had supplied an equally eye-popping array of news bits from the world of competitive gaming, or &quot;e-sports&quot;&#x2014;the sorts of facts that make you wonder whether you hadn&apos;t accidentally overslept by about 150 years. In August of 2013, the United States&apos; Citizenship and Immigration Services granted its first gamer-specific athletic visa to a Canadian <em>League of Legends</em> player named Danny Le. Five months after that, <em>The</em> <em>Wall Street Journal</em> announced that Twitch TV, an e-sports streaming site (that is, a site for watching other people play video games competitively) ranked third in peak Internet traffic, beating out Facebook, Hulu, Amazon, and Pandora. (Amazon recently bought Twitch for just shy of $1 billion.) And just one month before the horde of fans descended on Seattle, a college in Chicago declared it would begin granting athletic scholarships to e-sports athletes. There would be about sixty of them per year, each worth approximately $19,000.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.7">Here&apos;s what I was hoping to find out: Who, save the most direly mal-aligned, would endure the costs and inconveniences of travelling to a different country (or city, even) to watch players manipulate avatars on a screen the size of a hockey rink? Who were these world-class players competing for such a bloated prize purse? When, exactly, was it decided that video games were worthy of the same fevered allegiances and rituals we lend to our traditional sports? And, finally, what sort of peculiarities might one witness at the highest-paying e-sports showdown of all time?</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.8">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.9">The first TI4 lanyards materialize, as if by magic, on the train from SeaTac International Airport to the city&apos;s downtown. They dangle, purple and velvety, from the necks of four affable-looking young men I immediately estimate to be <em>a)</em> in their late teens and <em>b)</em> multi-generationally Midwestern. Even in my post-flight, sleep-deprived stupor, I develop a strong hunch that these guys know their stuff. For one thing, they bicker with military concision about the previous year&apos;s outcome, exchanging a pitter-patter of acronyms, names, statistics, and scoffs. Their clothing, too, is a giveaway: One wears a limited edition DotA T-shirt, and his lanyard is already dotted with a couple of Beanie Baby-style plush characters. The others twirl DotA-branded Sharpie markers and sport black <em>TI4 </em>&quot;Livestrong&quot;-style bracelets. Their discussion is impassioned, intelligent-sounding, and profoundly incomprehensible. I introduce myself and, almost immediately thereafter, beg for a crash course.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.a">The quartet comprises four-fifths of &quot;Scoots Canoe,&quot; a respectably skilled (though very much non-professional) DotA 2 team based in Omaha, Nebraska. Two are brothers: Martin Gilgenast, 18, is around six feet, round-featured and handsome. Thomas, four years his elder, is a bit shorter, with a kind smile and a crisp dollop of blond hair. Between them sits Nathan Davis, a lanky 18-year-old who perpetually jiggles one leg and is, for my money, a dead ringer for &quot;Where&apos;s Waldo?,&quot; sans glasses.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.b">Michael Tritz, a 20-year-old with rimless spectacles and a sand-colored ponytail, sits next to me. He takes the first crack at explaining the game. &quot;It&apos;s a steep learning curve,&quot; he begins. Unlike the real-time strategy games from which it was first developed, &quot;DotA is more complicated, and easier to lose at if you&apos;re bad.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.c">Each team of five players begins by drafting a roster of &quot;heroes&quot;&#x2014;characters that possess a variety of attacks and skills. These heroes start out weak, then engage in a series of small battles to level up their resources and abilities. The beginning of the game finds both teams positioned on opposite corners of a tree-dotted map. They battle for territory until one team is able to destroy a central structure at the heart of the other&apos;s base. Games tend to last between thirty to forty minutes, but they can be much shorter or longer, depending on the style of play. Some Chinese teams, for example, have a reputation for the sort of quick-strike aggression that upends opponents in about fifteen minutes. When a team is beat, its five members use the game&apos;s live chat function to congratulate their competition. Their messages&#x2014;&quot;gg,&quot; for &quot;good game&quot;&#x2014;appear onscreen in rapid succession. They denote surrender and feel, at times, complexly passive-aggressive.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.d">Got all that? It&apos;s essentially the barest-bones description there is. In truth, things are exponentially more complicated. Because each game presents the ten players with a total of 102 heroes to choose from during the selection period, it&apos;s not enough that a serious DotA player simply master one avatar; he or she must possess a working knowledge of dozens of them, along with a sense of which one might serve as an appropriate response to an opposing player&apos;s choice. An analogue in conventional sports&#x2014;&quot;physical sports,&quot; as e-sports fans like to call them&#x2014;would be something like drafting, assembling, conditioning and coaching a full basketball team, all within about half an hour.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.e">As the Nebraskans and I exit the train and begin walking through downtown, I&apos;m suddenly rocked by the realization that I have no idea what to expect when we arrive at TI4. I&apos;ve never played DotA before&#x2014;I haven&apos;t even picked up a video game controller in two years. And Michael&apos;s explanation of the game, though exceedingly patient, had made an intricate ruin of my notes.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.f">Hoping to start small, I asked them what sort of people I&apos;ll likely be running into at this event.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.g">Michael smirks. &quot;Males between the ages of 15 and 30,&quot; he says. &quot;And then some above.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.h">&quot;I&apos;ve seen some women,&quot; Nathan shoots back defensively. &quot;Maybe seven to eight percent.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.i">He glances back at me with a kindergarten teacher&apos;s patience. &quot;If they look like a character from the game, they&apos;re doing that on purpose.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.j">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.k">It is one thing to discuss DotA 2, with its kaleidoscopic strategies and variables, in a controlled setting with four patient Nebraskans. It is something else entirely to behold it projected onto an eighty-foot screen&#x2014;its teams enclosed in matching soundproof cases onstage, its audio effects amplified to the point of near cruelty, its fans shrieking and spilling their jumbo tubs of popcorn down the back of your shirt. When I&apos;d been warned that DotA was an immensely complex game for a beginner to understand, I should have appreciated the sheer profundity of that understatement. Everyone around me seems to gasp, boo and erupt with delighted applause as if obeying a series of familiar cues. My experience, meanwhile, is a queasy hallucination of roars, fireballs, spells, graphs and technical gibberish.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.l">This is why, early on the tournament&apos;s second day, I find myself in the Key Arena&apos;s basement-level pressroom, sourly dejected and inhaling complimentary mini-Snickers bars. For much of the morning, I&apos;d been glued to the &quot;Noob Stream&quot;&#x2014;a Twitch TV webcast of TI4, overlaid with commentary geared toward newbies, or &quot;noobs.&quot; Despite its hosts&apos; frequent tangents&#x2014;&quot;What a sneaky guy this guy is! I wouldn&apos;t let him date my sister, that&apos;s for sure!&quot;&#x2014;the Noob Stream has turned out to be a major lifeline. It supplies just the sort of dumbed-down synopses I need to begin understanding the game&apos;s teams, heroes, and strategies.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.m">The purest expertise, though, emanates from the industry journalists nearby. Since arriving, I&apos;d seen them ducking in and out of the pressroom, cracking Mountain Dews and firing off the same buzzwords the Nebraskans had recited on the train. They all seem to know each other, and their interactions feel at once jocular and world-weary. As far as e-sports go, most are veterans of the big events: Sweden&apos;s &quot;DreamHack,&quot; Frankfurt&apos;s &quot;ESL One,&quot; all the U.S.-based &quot;Major League Gaming&quot; stuff. Yet among them, there&apos;s a sense that TI4 feels distinct.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.n">&quot;I&apos;ve seen some pretty big venues, but this is on a different level,&quot; says Andrew Campbell, an L.A.-based DotA 2 commentator with a booming voice and a squid-like flop of brown dreadlocks. He wears a well-tailored button-up shirt, brown dress shoes and a pair of skintight DotA leggings. &quot;It&apos;s this intangible electricity. It doesn&apos;t translate to camera&#x2014;you can see the shot, and it&apos;s like, &apos;That&apos;s cool, people are going wild.&apos; But feeling the rumble of everyone cheering for their favorite team&#x2014;to me, it really legitimizes what I&apos;ve been doing for the last three years.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.o">Three years may feel like a long time to devote to video games, but it&apos;s really just a small sliver of e-sports&apos; history. Indeed, competitive gaming has been part of the U.S.&apos;s public conversation since at least 1982, when <em>Starcade, </em>an arcade-themed game show, first debuted on WTBS<em>. </em>Briefly hosted by Alex Trebek, it ran two seasons and pitted competitors against each other on the era&apos;s bulky kiosks. Later, after console purveyors like Nintendo and Sega replaced traditional arcades, gamers would photograph their high scores and mail them back to the companies as proof. Sega and Nintendo, in turn, would submit these scores for publication to industry magazines, which fans would collect and analyze.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.p">The development in the 1990s of first-person shooters like Doom and Quake yielded more breakthroughs. Suddenly, players could compete directly against hundreds of others, either through local area networks (LANs) or dial-up connections. In 1997, the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) featured a Quake tournament called &quot;Red Annihilation.&quot; Its grand prize was a 1987 Ferrari, once owned by the Quake developer John Carmack. (Dennis Fong, the Bay Area-based competitor who won it, later displayed it in the office of his own game company, <em>Gamers Extreme</em>.) The same year, a former investment banker named Angel Munoz founded the Cyberathlete Professional League, believed by many to be the first true e-sports organization. Its inaugural tournament, which took place in Dallas and featured about 400 individuals, had a prize pool of roughly $3,500.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.q">When League of Legends, the most widely-played e-sport in the world, held its last world championship in August of 2013, 32 million people tuned in online&#x2014;an increase from just 8.2 million the year before, and more than twice the amount of people who watched the 2013 World Series. The Grand Finals of TI4, I&apos;m told by the industry journos, will be aired on ESPN2. Its $10 million prize pool, with $5 million for first place, will make a millionaire out of each of the winning team&apos;s members. For context: Just a year ago, when TI3 took place in Seattle&apos;s Benaroya Hall, it sat only 2,500 people. Its prize pool, the largest in e-sports history at the time, was $2.8 million.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.r">&quot;The &apos;Chicken Little&apos; phase is finally over,&quot; explains Cody Conners, a former e-sports manager-turned industry blogger. &quot;When I started, I&apos;d go to bars and I&apos;d lie about what I did. If someone asked me what I did, I&apos;d say &apos;I work in tech&apos;&#x2014;which isn&apos;t necessarily a lie, but I wasn&apos;t telling the entirety of the truth. And I feel like now, you have to explain to me why this isn&apos;t a real big thing.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.s">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.t">Foolishly, I&apos;d thought that the possession of a TI4 press pass was a carte blanche for exploring every crag and cranny of the Key Arena&#x2014;floor seats, announcers&apos; boxes, athletes&apos; quarters, etc. Emboldened by the Noob Stream, I&apos;d even sketched a rough reporting plan for my second day at TI4. Phase 1: Duck into the players&apos; lounge and sip a $17 bubblegum daiquiri. Phase 2: Surreptitiously document strategies and juicy inter-team dramas. Phase 3: Retreat to the pressroom and analyze my findings with the other journos. Phase 4: Feast on Corn Nuts and bite-sized Krackel bars while bathing in the respect my impetuous gumshoeing had awarded.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.u">This, like so many of the plots I&apos;d had about the tournament, turns out to be grossly misinformed. Moments after ascending the staircase to the arena&apos;s lounge level, I&apos;m neutralized by a Valve employee prowling the area on a Razor scooter. She&apos;d coasted up behind me noiselessly, and I do a full-body flinch when she calls out.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.v">&quot;Hey there! Are you a player?&quot; Her smile is polite but firm; she&apos;s undoubtedly certain of the answer.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.w">&quot;Umm&#x2026;no. No, I&apos;m press,&quot; I say, fumbling with my lanyard.&#xA0;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.x">&quot;Right. So this is the lounge level. It&apos;s for players and managers only.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.y">&quot;Yes, but I&apos;ve got this&#x2026;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.z">Before I can even begin to build a case, she whooshes away on her scooter, speaking quietly into her walkie-talkie and glancing back at me. I begin to realize that showing up at the Key with the intention of obtaining long, introspective player interviews a bit like strutting into at Yankee Stadium, never having watched baseball, and asking for a one-on-one with Derek Jeter. I&apos;d need to regroup.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.10">Miraculously, I manage to wheedle a sit-down with Alex Garfield, the CEO of Evil Geniuses, a well-renowned American team that&apos;s made it to the tournament&apos;s semi-final round. If I can&apos;t embed with the players in the midst of this high stakes digi-drama, perhaps I can at least learn of their travails secondhand.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.11">Garfield, a former classical violinist, speaks with the measured patience of someone accustomed to explaining his job in terms that would satisfy a four-year-old. He began his e-sports career in college, when he fronted a Canadian Counter-Strike team $1,000 to compete in a Dallas tournament. They won second place, and he never looked back. Today, Evil Geniuses is a multi-million dollar company with more than a dozen employees and close to 50 players across a handful of games.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.12">I&apos;m eager to know how the players are reacting to the tournament&apos;s increased size, exposure and pressures. Each morning, they arrive in chauffeured limousines, at private entrances, as admirers jostle and shout. I&apos;d seen a few try to score nachos or a corndog at one of the arena&apos;s concession stands, only to be swarmed by fans looking for photographs. And once, when I was eating personal pizzas with the Nebraskans, Nathan dashed off to acquire an autograph from one of his favorite Chinese stars. His attempt, and the player&apos;s awkward rejection, stuck out as the tournament&apos;s single most heartbreaking moment thus far.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.13">&quot;How scalable is it when you get from a 1,000 or 2,000-person event to a 10,000-person event where every single fan, or a lot of those fans at the event, feel very close to their celebrities&#x2014;much closer than they might feel to their favorite basketball player?&quot; Garfield says. Often, fans develop relationships to e-sports stars through livestreams in which the players talk about everything from strategy to family issues to their love lives. It&apos;s easy to feel like you know them, to forget that they&apos;re actually addressing thousands&#x2014;sometimes millions&#x2014;of people.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.14">&quot;If everybody watching player X&apos;s stream really feels like they&apos;re his best friend,&quot; Garfield continues, &quot;you&apos;re going to have that many people coming and seeing that they have to share them.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.15">As he talks, a Chinese team ducks out of the roped-off exit behind us. They form a loose circle, smoking cigarettes and strategizing about their next match. Thirty feet away, behind a waist-high barrier, a small crowd begins to form. They elbow each other in the ribs and snap iPhone photos. A few begin to shout over to the players, trying to get them to look. The players pretend to not notice.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.16">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.17">The tournament&apos;s Grand Finals kick off at around 10 a.m. on Monday, and are a frenzied, fascinating affair. Very few fans seem keen on returning to their nine-to-fives; if anything, the arena feels more packed and kinetic than it has all weekend. With a DotA expertise that&apos;s now hovering somewhere between &quot;unfortunate&quot; and &quot;tolerable,&quot; I decide it&apos;s time to graduate from the Noob Stream and join the rest of the masses above ground. It takes me about 35 minutes to find the Nebraskans and stumble across a row of polite fans to take a seat among them.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.18">The two remaining teams, Vici Gaming and Newbee, are both Chinese&#x2014;and both renowned for their abrupt, bombastic gameplay. The day before, Vici had ousted Garfield&apos;s Evil Geniuses in a rapid blitzkrieg. Newbee, meanwhile, had fought its way to the winners bracket in earlier competitions. It appeared to be anyone&apos;s game.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.19">&quot;It&apos;s going to be pretty explosive,&quot; Michael says as I sit down, my pockets bulging with a final raid of the pressroom&apos;s goodies. &quot;It should be over pretty quick. Neither of these teams is drafting for a late game strategy.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.1a">He&apos;s correct. The games are warp-speed. I could spend a paragraph or two here explaining what I saw&#x2014;Vici&apos;s early lead, Newbee&apos;s sneaky and masterful comeback, the Nebraskans&apos; exasperated reaction when someone behind us screams, &quot;Time for the YOLO push!!&quot; But if I&apos;m being honest, even my best attempts at explication would be offensive to true e-sports adherents.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.1b">So suffice it to say that when Newbee takes the grand final&#x2014;along with $5,028,038&#x2014;a series of cannons erupts directly behind them. Purple confetti flits through the air, and a blinding spritz of sparks shoots upward from the stage. The crowd is on their feet, yours truly included, chanting &quot;Newbee! Newbee! Newbee!&quot;, and the whole place smells like gunpowder, popcorn, Twizzlers, and body odor. This is the closest it&apos;s felt to an athletic event all weekend. Which is to say, only kind of close.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.1c">As an announcer attempts to congratulate Newbee through the assistance of a translator, I ask the Nebraskans what they thought of T14 spageantry. Are they planning on doing it all again next year?</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.1d">&quot;He&apos;s going to Richmond, he&apos;s going to Boston, I&apos;m staying in Omaha, he&apos;s going to Philadelphia for grad school,&quot; Michael says, pointing to his friends. &quot;So we&apos;ll be splitting up after this. It is cool that we could come and do this together, you know, because DotA is a lot of how we became friends in the first place.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.1e">They all reflect for a moment, as if this realization had just hit them. Then we file out.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.1f">After parting ways with the Nebraskans, I consider trying to finesse my way into a players&apos; afterparty I&apos;d heard about. But even after a full weekend of interviews and friendly banter with the industry journos, I can&apos;t imagine who&apos;d let me in. (Some of the industry journos had, for their part, been grumbling about not being invited.) Plus, I&apos;m tired in the way eating peanut butter crackers and candy all weekend makes one tired. I don&apos;t feel the sort of giddy lucidity I often experience after seeing a live sports game. I feel groggy and slightly sad&#x2014;like I&apos;m stumbling out of a movie theater in the middle of the day.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.1g">I don&apos;t try to hunt down Newbee, the quintet of newly minted millionaires who just set a Guinness World Record. I don&apos;t push into the autograph lines that are forming&#x2014;around players, announcers, even some of the industry journos. I don&apos;t look for Alex Garfield, whose Evil Geniuses took third place, and $1,038,455 in prize money.</p><p data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.4.1h">Instead, I stuff my lanyard into my backpack and head to the Space Needle. Like the other tourists.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".6p3ippel8g.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
