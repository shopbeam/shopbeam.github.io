  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AGQ correspondent Robert Draper embedded himself with the freshman Republicans in the House of Representatives for his new book Do Not Ask What Good We Do, an inside account of congressional dysfunction in the first term of the Obama administration. At the time, our correspondent Marin Cogan was a Politico reporter covering the freshmen beat. In an interview, the two talk about the most memorable freshmen members, who\u0027s really to blame for the debt ceiling crisis, and what Anthony Weiner\u0027s up to now. \u000A\u000AThis interview has been edited for length.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: So let\u0027s talk about your new book. To report it, you spent the last year immersed in the House.\u000A\u000ARobert Draper: The timing went like this: On the evening of the midterms I was watching TV rather wistfully because I had an existing book contract to work on race relations in America during the forty year period between King\u0027s assassination and Obama\u0027s election, and watching these Tea Party freshmen who\u0027d just been elected I began thinking \u0027These are my people.\u0027 They seemed like such great characters, particularly the ones that never had political experience at all, and so I thought that their own narrative, following them into Washington to watch them try to change the institution or possibly be changed by it was an irresistible story ... From that point onward I embedded myself within the House and what this meant was that every day they were in session I was on the Hill following these guys around, was often at their town halls when they were not in session, like where you saw me for first time in Fort Lauderdale. That\u0027s where it began. I finished the last word of the book the day after Obama\u0027s State of the Union address on January 26th of this year and then we published it less than three months later.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: I was the House freshman reporter for Politico at the time, also embedded with the class, so I feel like I know these guys pretty well. And so if you got this wrong it\u0027d be pretty awkward...but you got it so right. Even if someone was totally tuned out of Congress for the last two years, they could read your account and get a rundown of the best and the most important stories—the shooting of Gabby Giffords, the implosion of Anthony Weiner, the debt ceiling standoff, all the way to the horrible kabuki dance that was the supercommittee negotiations—with these lovely profiles of some major (and minor) House figures woven throughout.\u000A\u000AFirst, let\u0027s talk about the characters that populate the book. How did you choose them? Jeff Duncan (SC-3) was an interesting choice. The four horsemen of South Carolina were by far my favorite delegation in the class. They were all such funny, intelligent, larger than life guys. And Duncan always did struggle to stand out around those big personalities like Trey Gowdy (SC-4) and Mick Mulvaney (SC-5) and Tim Scott (SC-1) —but he was in some ways very emblematic, an everyman.\u000A\u000ARobert Draper: Right, I feel like that is the ongoing experiential narrative of the House. I knew that there would be some drama particular to the 112th Congress. I didn\u0027t know what it would be, but I figured that with these 87 freshmen something unusual was likely to happen, but what I also wanted to capture was the ongoing experience of being one member in a body of 435, trying to be heard. And when I first met Duncan he was not the most distinguished politician, he was far from a rock star like Allen West (FL-22) or Sean Duffy (WI-7) or Kristi Noem (SD-AL), but I began to realize maybe that was the point, that maybe what my book needed was the everyman.\u000A\u000AAs you know with Duncan, these bumper sticker reductions of humans don\u0027t get you very far. Duncan is a very forthright guy, he\u0027s a deeply conservative South Carolina Christian, but he also says what\u0027s on his mind, and in his own way, he became an important congressman in this session. He symbolized or was emblematic of the conservatism of the freshmen bloc that pulled leadership and rest of House Republican to the right and created a dynamic in congress that could basically be described as paralysis. But I think just as I was finishing the book I remember talking to a certain top staffer in Speaker Boehner\u0027s office who asked me who my main characters would be and when I mentioned Jeff Duncan, he wrinkled up his face and said \u0027Who?\u0027 That\u0027s when I realized that the experience I was capturing of Duncan\u0027s struggles to be heard was a very poignant one if a top member of the Speaker\u0027s office didn\u0027t know who he was.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: Some of the characters in your book, I\u0027m thinking Sheila Jackson Lee (TX-18), or Anthony Weiner, or Allen West, were examples of what some people would plainly consider to be the problem with Congress. People who came to Washington with maybe good ambitions, or who fight for good causes, but are undone either by personal ambition or vice or partisan vitriol. But they\u0027re characters you portray with such empathy. Did you ever struggle with that—did you ever think, this person is clearly a part of the problem?\u000A\u000ARobert Draper: You bring up a really good point, which is that these are individuals who would seem to be a part of the problem, but that in and of itself illustrates a duality in an institution that, on the one hand, has a record low approval rating, but on the other hand has so many damn incumbents who continually get reelected. They hate Congress but they seem to be okay with their own congressmen. As for the empathy factor, I just as a journalist become interested in people, and what motivates them, and in particular with those who are widely disliked. Those people are subject to caricature, the caricatures don\u0027t come close to encompassing the whole person. That\u0027s true for example with Anthony Weiner, who, though I think the book furnishes even more reason to dislike this guy, none the less was brilliant and whether the Democrats realized it or not is missed by the other Democrats.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: There was a narrative about these freshmen that began before they got there—and it was largely true, I think, that they were just going to obstruct like crazy and vote against everything and drag everyone to the right. Politico and more recently the New York Times did a vote analysis on this, saying that the freshmen voted against their leaders with roughly the same frequency as their upperclassmen counterparts. How do you explain that?\u000A\u000ARobert Draper: The problem is that Politico and also The New York Times and other media organizations have concluded from those statistics that therefore there is a \u0027myth\u0027 to the freshman voting bloc. As the book makes clear, and the more candid members of Republican leadership spell out, so much energy was erted in getting freshmen to vote with leadership and so many concessions were extracted by those freshmen that ultimately every bit of legislation at least implicitly had the stamp of the freshmen all over it. The result was legislation that was so far to the right of legislation that had been previously contemplated by Republicans, that became thoroughly unpalatable to the Democratic controlled Senate and to Obama, which guaranteed paralysis. Marin, don\u0027t forget that [Budget Committee Chairman] Paul Ryan, which my book mentions, had offered his Ryan budget in 2008, 2009, 2010. And a big chunk of Republicans voted against that budget. Only when these freshmen came on board did Ryan realize through the listening sessions with [Majority Whip] [Kevin McCarthy](http://kevinmccarthy.house.gov/) that these guys were right where he was, and it laid a path for virtually unanimous passage among Republicans of the Ryan budget. That\u0027s because of the freshmen class.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: There were a mix of other factors, both the RSC and outside groups like Heritage Action, helping them push, and the upperclassmen who were emboldened by the meaning of the freshmen class and the rhetoric of the class, to stand with them and push harder. It was also the leadership strategy of letting the House work its will, and McCarthy\u0027s hands-off style. Do you ever wonder about what it would have been like if they had cracked the whip a little more with these freshmen?\u000A\u000ARobert Draper: Yeah. I wondered about it a lot, because as the book details in that meeting near the end, where the appropriations cardinals had a meeting with Speaker Boehner and the other leaders to yell at them because so many people were voting against the CR, and Boehner\u0027s position to them then was, \u0027We can\u0027t punish them, people will just make martyrs out of them. We\u0027ll just reward them for good behavior rather than try to exact reprisals for bad behavior.\u0027 And yeah, it does beg the question, even with no earmarks, even with vigilance of right wing groups, couldn\u0027t there have been a little more done to turn the screws? I think that McCarthy has a real affinity for the freshmen and maybe that\u0027s been a good thing ultimately for leadership, but he\u0027s not the one to break knuckles, that\u0027s just not his style. Even if he had the tools I doubt he\u0027d be able to do it. The big question, the one I wrestled with was: What if Tom DeLay were Whip? Or Majority Leader or Speaker? DeLay was not just a knuckle breaker but he knew how to bait the hook, and he also knew the pressure points. McCarthy, this is only his third term there, and Boehner for his part is kind of an aloof CEO, friendly but aloof, and doesn\u0027t have a relationship with these newer members. We\u0027re not going to know answer to these questions but it\u0027s an interesting question to ask.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: You touched on this in the book, but from their point of view, the freshmen really didn\u0027t seem to know what the hell was going on most of the time. Their leaders were negotiating behind closed doors, which was the opposite of what they wanted, and not telling them anything, and then they have a million reporters like me chasing them down in the hallway asking them about frameworks for negotiations leaked by the White House. It plainly frustrated them. How did that shape their role in the negotiations?\u000A\u000ARobert Draper: Well, you\u0027re right that the backroom negotiations between Obama and Boehner raised the suspicions of these freshmen, who believed this kind of behavior was exactly what was wrong with Washington. Raul Labrador (ID-1) had made a point of saying that in one of the Republican conferences mentioned in the book. Their basic suspicion, and the fact that they were never allied with Boehner to begin with, the way the freshman class of \u002794 was beholden to Newt Gingrich in \u002794, meant that Boehner\u0027s hold over them was always pretty tenuous. During debt ceiling standoffs, as book mentions, some of Boehner\u0027s allies came to warn him that if he produced a deal with Obama that didn\u0027t get the requisite votes from Republicans there could very well be a mutiny, one that would benefit Eric Cantor, the Majority Leader, and prove to be the undoing of Boehner. There\u0027s no question that that warning had an impact on Boehner.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: I remember the press pack mentality pretty well during the debt ceiling standoff, and I think it\u0027s fair to say that the media mostly agreed with the White House line that Republicans were just being intransigent and impossible. Some of the recent reporting, by The Washington Post for example, that has suggested that really Obama bears more responsibility than we might have thought at the time because of the last minute request for more revenues. I know that\u0027s a story line Republicans pushed. Do you buy that?\u000A\u000ARobert Draper: No. I agree that the Obama administration moved the goal posts. They did so, however, because the Gang of Six was discussing a deal in the Senate that was in alignment with the numbers in Simpson-Bowles, and it didn\u0027t make sense in the view of the Obama administration to be negotiating something much lower than that in terms of revenues. My point of view is that, as fine a story as Matt Bai\u0027s story in The New York Times Magazine was and as comprehensive as The Washington Post story was, what neither story takes into account is that Boehner never had the votes. He never had the votes for a grand bargain, there\u0027s just simply nothing that he would have been able to sell to his conference.\u000A\u000AI should say also that Kevin McCarthy had told me of his way of viewing the new conservative behavior in the Republican conference. He mentioned that one of his two older Labradors had died and he replaced it with a puppy, and as a result the older Labrador began to behave like a puppy too. He analogized it to the Republicans in the House. Now that the puppies/freshmen were on board, it proved to be invigorating to more of these senior more reptilian congressmen, that they too were showing new life. This is further to the point of not only the votes that Boehner couldn\u0027t get on the debt ceiling, but also to the point of who was voting most with whom, the freshmen or senior conservatives. In a lot of ways the freshmen were catalytic to the behavior of conservatives who had always been conservatives but felt somewhat demoralized until they came on board.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: Have you spoken with any of them lately? I remember talking to a few who were trying to reconsider how they looked at their jobs as legislators. They\u0027d more or less given up on trying to get legislation into law in this Congress and they were starting to think, is it drilling down on subcommittee work, or focusing on constituent services, or something else?\u000A\u000ARobert Draper: Yeah, I have. Of course it depends on who you talk to. For all of my elucidation of the freshmen bloc, I try in my book to disaggregate them and look at them as individuals. There are some, like Duncan for example, who are hoping they can climb the ladder of a particular subcommittee and become chairman. There are others like Kristi Noem who have been intensely focused on district issues really from the start, and then there are others like Joe Walsh from Illinois, who, when he hasn\u0027t been focused on trying to get on television, has simply asserted himself as the spokesman of the national Tea Party movement. I do think there\u0027s a shared frustration among all of these new Republican congressman and an ongoing skepticism about how leadership is going to produce legislation that they want to see produced. It\u0027s not as if there\u0027s a growing movement to clean house amongst leadership, but, at same time, I can tell you that it\u0027s not like the freshmen, with a few exceptions, have suddenly decided that John Boehner is the ideal Speaker. I\u0027ve seen no sign of that.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: A lot of books about Congress come with these policy prescriptions about how we can make this all better at the end. Your book is different. Did you come away from this with any sense of how this Congress could be fid?\u000A\u000ARobert Draper: There are a couple of things, I guess. One would be redistricting reform. Of course, waving a wand and making that happen would be a trick. But what has occurred is that because of redistricting, slowly the number of swing districts has been eliminated, and instead we have only very Democratic and very Republican districts. Guys who come to town are hard left and hard right and it creates prescription for nothing being agreed upon. There\u0027s been efforts, all of them fruitless, by John Tanner and others to pass legislation that would have commissions rather than legislatures do the redistricting, that would make a difference. But another that may be equally difficult would be the emergence of a third party, because right now the center is taken for granted, right now moderates and independents are taken for granted. But if there was a place for them to gravitate, a party, and if both sides first began to lose all of their votes in the middle by people who were only barely Republican or barely Democrat then they might realize that there might be something to be gained by appealing to those people who are turned off by partisan extremism. Those are the two possibilities for reform short of a depression or a war that might cause these guys to get their act together.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: You sound really hopeful.\u000A\u000ARobert Draper:  Yeah, sure thing! No not at all, but there\u0027s nothing behaviorally—after all, Marin, they came back from the debt ceiling stand off with their approval rating plummeting and people saying \u0027Can\u0027t you get your act together?\u0027 And nothing of the latter sort occurred. Of course there is another prescription, it\u0027s the most obvious one. It\u0027s called the ballot box. This is the most democratic institution in America, they have to face the passions of the public every two years, and nothing would cause them to change more than if virtually every incumbent were voted out of office, but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s going to happen either.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: Right but this is another thing that we both saw, which is that the electorate is often schizophrenic. They get home and get screamed at for being too intransigent and not getting along and they also get screamed at for capitulating and working too closely with congressional leadership.\u000A\u000ARobert Draper: One thing I found particularly dismaying as I went to these guys\u0027 districts is that when they would throw town halls, the people who would show up would be the people who are the most activist in their party, and in the case of the Republican party it\u0027s the Tea Party activists.\u000A\u000AMarin Cogan: Have you talked to Anthony Weiner lately?\u000A\u000ARobert Draper: We traded emails. He emailed me when the first excerpts of the book were leaked to Politico, and it was a humorous exchange, and further an invitation to have him buy me a drink when I got to New York. But then the New York Post started really beating up on him and hyperbolizing what was in my book and I never quite received that invitation from Weiner. I talked to Jon Stewart back stage about it in the green room. Stewart has known him a long time, and he thought Weiner probably felt okay about the book because in Stewart\u0027s view treatment of Weiner was more than fair. But I\u0027ve come to believe that people don\u0027t want to just be treated fairly. They want to be rhapsodized over or exonerated.\u000A\u000ARead more from Death Race 2012:\u000A\u000A[Tapas with the Four Horsemen: South Carolina\u0027s Most Influential Conservatives on Newt\u0027s Brain, Romney\u0027s Personality, and 9 1/2 Weeks\u0027 Best Scenes\u000A\u000A](http://www.gq.com/news-politics/blogs/death-race/2012/01/the-four-horseman-of-south-carolina.html#ixzz1tYsDeckP)\u000A\u000A Weekend Watching: Robert Draper on The Daily Show\u000A\u000A\u0022I can do it one night, but don\u0027t ask me to come again tomorrow night.\u0022 Scenes from the White House Correspondents\u0027 Dinner\u000A\u000AThe Most (And Least) Powerful People in Politics This Week\u000A\u000AFollow GQ correspondent Marin Cogan on Twitter for more updates from the campaign trail.",

correspondent Robert Draper embedded himself with the freshman Republicans in the House of Representatives for his new book</em> Do Not Ask What Good We Do, <em>an inside account of congressional dysfunction in the first term of the Obama administration. At the time, our correspondent Marin Cogan was a Politico reporter covering the freshmen beat. In an interview, the two talk about the most memorable freshmen members, who&#x2019;s really to blame for the debt ceiling crisis, and what Anthony Weiner&#x2019;s up to now. </em></p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.2">This interview has been edited for length.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>Marin Cogan:</strong> So let&#x2019;s talk about your new book. To report it, you spent the last year immersed in the House.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Robert Draper:</strong> The timing went like this: On the evening of the midterms I was watching TV rather wistfully because I had an existing book contract to work on race relations in America during the forty year period between King&#x2019;s assassination and Obama&#x2019;s election, and watching these Tea Party freshmen who&#x2019;d just been elected I began thinking &#x2019;These are my people.&#x2019; They seemed like such great characters, particularly the ones that never had political experience at all, and so I thought that their own narrative, following them into Washington to watch them try to change the institution or possibly be changed by it was an irresistible story ... From that point onward I embedded myself within the House and what this meant was that every day they were in session I was on the Hill following these guys around, was often at their town halls when they were not in session, like where you saw me for first time in Fort Lauderdale. That&#x2019;s where it began. I finished the last word of the book the day after Obama&#x2019;s State of the Union address on January 26th of this year and then we published it less than three months later.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Marin Cogan:</strong> I was the House freshman reporter for Politico at the time, also embedded with the class, so I feel like I know these guys pretty well. And so if you got this wrong it&#x2019;d be pretty awkward...but you got it so right. Even if someone was totally tuned out of Congress for the last two years, they could read your account and get a rundown of the best and the most important stories&#x2014;the shooting of Gabby Giffords, the implosion of Anthony Weiner, the debt ceiling standoff, all the way to the horrible kabuki dance that was the supercommittee negotiations&#x2014;with these lovely profiles of some major (and minor) House figures woven throughout.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.7">First, let&#x2019;s talk about the characters that populate the book. How did you choose them? <a href="http://jeffduncan.house.gov/">Jeff Duncan</a> (SC-3) was an interesting choice. The <a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/blogs/death-race/2012/01/the-four-horseman-of-south-carolina.html">four horsemen of South Carolina</a> were by far my favorite delegation in the class. They were all such funny, intelligent, larger than life guys. And Duncan always did struggle to stand out around those big personalities like <a href="http://gowdy.house.gov/">Trey Gowdy</a> (SC-4) and <a href="http://www.mulvaneyforcongress.com/">Mick Mulvaney</a> (SC-5) and <a href="http://timscott.house.gov/">Tim Scott</a> (SC-1) &#x2014;but he was in some ways very emblematic, an everyman.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Robert Draper:</strong> Right, I feel like that is the ongoing experiential narrative of the House. I knew that there would be some drama particular to the 112th Congress. I didn&#x2019;t know what it would be, but I figured that with these 87 freshmen something unusual was likely to happen, but what I also wanted to capture was the ongoing experience of being one member in a body of 435, trying to be heard. And when I first met Duncan he was not the most distinguished politician, he was far from a rock star like <a href="http://west.house.gov/">Allen West</a> (FL-22) or <a href="http://duffy.house.gov/">Sean Duffy</a> (WI-7) or<a href="http://www.kristiforcongress.com/"> Kristi Noem</a> (SD-AL), but I began to realize maybe that was the point, that maybe what my book needed was the everyman.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.9">As you know with Duncan, these bumper sticker reductions of humans don&#x2019;t get you very far. Duncan is a very forthright guy, he&#x2019;s a deeply conservative South Carolina Christian, but he also says what&#x2019;s on his mind, and in his own way, he became an important congressman in this session. He symbolized or was emblematic of the conservatism of the freshmen bloc that pulled leadership and rest of House Republican to the right and created a dynamic in congress that could basically be described as paralysis. But I think just as I was finishing the book I remember talking to a certain top staffer in Speaker Boehner&#x2019;s office who asked me who my main characters would be and when I mentioned Jeff Duncan, he wrinkled up his face and said &#x2019;Who?&#x2019; That&#x2019;s when I realized that the experience I was capturing of Duncan&#x2019;s struggles to be heard was a very poignant one if a top member of the Speaker&#x2019;s office didn&#x2019;t know who he was.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Marin Cogan: </strong>Some of the characters in your book, I&#x2019;m thinking <a href="http://jacksonlee.house.gov/">Sheila Jackson Lee</a> (TX-18), or Anthony Weiner, or Allen West, were examples of what some people would plainly consider to be the problem with Congress. People who came to Washington with maybe good ambitions, or who fight for good causes, but are undone either by personal ambition or vice or partisan vitriol. But they&#x2019;re characters you portray with such empathy. Did you ever struggle with that&#x2014;did you ever think, this person is clearly a part of the problem?</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Robert Draper:</strong> You bring up a really good point, which is that these are individuals who would seem to be a part of the problem, but that in and of itself illustrates a duality in an institution that, on the one hand, has a record low approval rating, but on the other hand has so many damn incumbents who continually get reelected. They hate Congress but they seem to be okay with their own congressmen. As for the empathy factor, I just as a journalist become interested in people, and what motivates them, and in particular with those who are widely disliked. Those people are subject to caricature, the caricatures don&#x2019;t come close to encompassing the whole person. That&#x2019;s true for example with Anthony Weiner, who, though I think the book furnishes even more reason to dislike this guy, none the less was brilliant and whether the Democrats realized it or not is missed by the other Democrats.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Marin Cogan:</strong> There was a narrative about these freshmen that began before they got there&#x2014;and it was largely true, I think, that they were just going to obstruct like crazy and vote against everything and drag everyone to the right. <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0911/63452.html">Politico </a>and more recently the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/us/politics/house-freshmen-not-as-defiant-as-their-reputation-suggests.html?smid=tw-nytimesnational&amp;seid=auto"><em>New York Times</em></a> did a vote analysis on this, saying that the freshmen voted against their leaders with roughly the same frequency as their upperclassmen counterparts. How do you explain that?</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Robert Draper:</strong> The problem is that Politico and also <em>The New York Times </em>and other media organizations have concluded from those statistics that therefore there is a &#x2019;myth&#x2019; to the freshman voting bloc. As the book makes clear, and the more candid members of Republican leadership spell out, so much energy was erted in getting freshmen to vote with leadership and so many concessions were extracted by those freshmen that ultimately every bit of legislation at least implicitly had the stamp of the freshmen all over it. The result was legislation that was so far to the right of legislation that had been previously contemplated by Republicans, that became thoroughly unpalatable to the Democratic controlled Senate and to Obama, which guaranteed paralysis. Marin, don&#x2019;t forget that [Budget Committee Chairman] Paul Ryan, which my book mentions, had offered his Ryan budget in 2008, 2009, 2010. And a big chunk of Republicans voted against that budget. Only when these freshmen came on board did Ryan realize through the listening sessions with [Majority Whip] [Kevin McCarthy](http://kevinmccarthy.house.gov/) that these guys were right where he was, and it laid a path for virtually unanimous passage among Republicans of the Ryan budget. That&#x2019;s because of the freshmen class.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Marin Cogan:</strong> There were a mix of other factors, both the RSC and outside groups like Heritage Action, helping them push, and the upperclassmen who were emboldened by the meaning of the freshmen class and the rhetoric of the class, to stand with them and push harder. It was also the leadership strategy of letting the House work its will, and McCarthy&#x2019;s hands-off style. Do you ever wonder about what it would have been like if they had cracked the whip a little more with these freshmen?</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Robert Draper:</strong> Yeah. I wondered about it a lot, because as the book details in that meeting near the end, where the appropriations cardinals had a meeting with Speaker Boehner and the other leaders to yell at them because so many people were voting against the CR, and Boehner&#x2019;s position to them then was, &#x2019;We can&#x2019;t punish them, people will just make martyrs out of them. We&#x2019;ll just reward them for good behavior rather than try to exact reprisals for bad behavior.&#x2019; And yeah, it does beg the question, even with no earmarks, even with vigilance of right wing groups, couldn&#x2019;t there have been a little more done to turn the screws? I think that McCarthy has a real affinity for the freshmen and maybe that&#x2019;s been a good thing ultimately for leadership, but he&#x2019;s not the one to break knuckles, that&#x2019;s just not his style. Even if he had the tools I doubt he&#x2019;d be able to do it. The big question, the one I wrestled with was: What if Tom DeLay were Whip? Or Majority Leader or Speaker? DeLay was not just a knuckle breaker but he knew how to bait the hook, and he also knew the pressure points. McCarthy, this is only his third term there, and Boehner for his part is kind of an aloof CEO, friendly but aloof, and doesn&#x2019;t have a relationship with these newer members. We&#x2019;re not going to know answer to these questions but it&#x2019;s an interesting question to ask.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>Marin Cogan:</strong> You touched on this in the book, but from their point of view, the freshmen really didn&#x2019;t seem to know what the hell was going on most of the time. Their leaders were negotiating behind closed doors, which was the opposite of what they wanted, and not telling them anything, and then they have a million reporters like me chasing them down in the hallway asking them about frameworks for negotiations leaked by the White House. It plainly frustrated them. How did that shape their role in the negotiations?</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>Robert Draper: </strong>Well, you&#x2019;re right that the backroom negotiations between Obama and Boehner raised the suspicions of these freshmen, who believed this kind of behavior was exactly what was wrong with Washington. <a href="http://labrador.house.gov/">Raul Labrador</a> (ID-1) had made a point of saying that in one of the Republican conferences mentioned in the book. Their basic suspicion, and the fact that they were never allied with Boehner to begin with, the way the freshman class of &#x2019;94 was beholden to Newt Gingrich in &#x2019;94, meant that Boehner&#x2019;s hold over them was always pretty tenuous. During debt ceiling standoffs, as book mentions, some of Boehner&#x2019;s allies came to warn him that if he produced a deal with Obama that didn&#x2019;t get the requisite votes from Republicans there could very well be a mutiny, one that would benefit Eric Cantor, the Majority Leader, and prove to be the undoing of Boehner. There&#x2019;s no question that that warning had an impact on Boehner.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Marin Cogan:</strong> I remember the press pack mentality pretty well during the debt ceiling standoff, and I think it&#x2019;s fair to say that the media mostly agreed with the White House line that Republicans were just being intransigent and impossible. Some of the recent reporting, by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/origins-of-the-debt-showdown/2011/08/03/gIQA9uqIzI_story.html">The Washington Post</a> for example, that has suggested that really Obama bears more responsibility than we might have thought at the time because of the last minute request for more revenues. I know that&#x2019;s a story line Republicans pushed. Do you buy that?</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>Robert Draper:</strong> No. I agree that the Obama administration moved the goal posts. They did so, however, because the Gang of Six was discussing a deal in the Senate that was in alignment with the numbers in Simpson-Bowles, and it didn&#x2019;t make sense in the view of the Obama administration to be negotiating something much lower than that in terms of revenues. My point of view is that, as fine a story as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/magazine/obama-vs-boehner-who-killed-the-debt-deal.html?pagewanted=all">Matt Bai&#x2019;s story</a> in <em>The New York Times Magazine</em> was and as comprehensive as <em>The Washington Post</em> story was, what neither story takes into account is that Boehner never had the votes. He never had the votes for a grand bargain, there&#x2019;s just simply nothing that he would have been able to sell to his conference.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.k">I should say also that Kevin McCarthy had told me of his way of viewing the new conservative behavior in the Republican conference. He mentioned that one of his two older Labradors had died and he replaced it with a puppy, and as a result the older Labrador began to behave like a puppy too. He analogized it to the Republicans in the House. Now that the puppies/freshmen were on board, it proved to be invigorating to more of these senior more reptilian congressmen, that they too were showing new life. This is further to the point of not only the votes that Boehner couldn&#x2019;t get on the debt ceiling, but also to the point of who was voting most with whom, the freshmen or senior conservatives. In a lot of ways the freshmen were catalytic to the behavior of conservatives who had always been conservatives but felt somewhat demoralized until they came on board.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>Marin Cogan:</strong> Have you spoken with any of them lately? I remember talking to a few who were trying to reconsider how they looked at their jobs as legislators. They&#x2019;d more or less given up on trying to get legislation into law in this Congress and they were starting to think, is it drilling down on subcommittee work, or focusing on constituent services, or something else?</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>Robert Draper:</strong> Yeah, I have. Of course it depends on who you talk to. For all of my elucidation of the freshmen bloc, I try in my book to disaggregate them and look at them as individuals. There are some, like Duncan for example, who are hoping they can climb the ladder of a particular subcommittee and become chairman. There are others like Kristi Noem who have been intensely focused on district issues really from the start, and then there are others like <a href="http://walshforcongress.com/">Joe Walsh</a> from Illinois, who, when he hasn&#x2019;t been focused on trying to get on television, has simply asserted himself as the spokesman of the national Tea Party movement. I do think there&#x2019;s a shared frustration among all of these new Republican congressman and an ongoing skepticism about how leadership is going to produce legislation that they want to see produced. It&#x2019;s not as if there&#x2019;s a growing movement to clean house amongst leadership, but, at same time, I can tell you that it&#x2019;s not like the freshmen, with a few exceptions, have suddenly decided that John Boehner is the ideal Speaker. I&#x2019;ve seen no sign of that.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>Marin Cogan:</strong> A lot of books about Congress come with these policy prescriptions about how we can make this all better at the end. Your book is different. Did you come away from this with any sense of how this Congress could be fid?</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>Robert Draper:</strong> There are a couple of things, I guess. One would be redistricting reform. Of course, waving a wand and making that happen would be a trick. But what has occurred is that because of redistricting, slowly the number of swing districts has been eliminated, and instead we have only very Democratic and very Republican districts. Guys who come to town are hard left and hard right and it creates prescription for nothing being agreed upon. There&#x2019;s been efforts, all of them fruitless, by John Tanner and others to pass legislation that would have commissions rather than legislatures do the redistricting, that would make a difference. But another that may be equally difficult would be the emergence of a third party, because right now the center is taken for granted, right now moderates and independents are taken for granted. But if there was a place for them to gravitate, a party, and if both sides first began to lose all of their votes in the middle by people who were only barely Republican or barely Democrat then they might realize that there might be something to be gained by appealing to those people who are turned off by partisan extremism. Those are the two possibilities for reform short of a depression or a war that might cause these guys to get their act together.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>Marin Cogan: </strong>You sound really hopeful.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>Robert Draper: </strong> Yeah, sure thing! No not at all, but there&#x2019;s nothing behaviorally&#x2014;after all, Marin, they came back from the debt ceiling stand off with their approval rating plummeting and people saying &#x2019;Can&#x2019;t you get your act together?&#x2019; And nothing of the latter sort occurred. Of course there is another prescription, it&#x2019;s the most obvious one. It&#x2019;s called the ballot box. This is the most democratic institution in America, they have to face the passions of the public every two years, and nothing would cause them to change more than if virtually every incumbent were voted out of office, but I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s going to happen either.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>Marin Cogan:</strong> Right but this is another thing that we both saw, which is that the electorate is often schizophrenic. They get home and get screamed at for being too intransigent and not getting along and they also get screamed at for capitulating and working too closely with congressional leadership.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>Robert Draper:</strong> One thing I found particularly dismaying as I went to these guys&#x2019; districts is that when they would throw town halls, the people who would show up would be the people who are the most activist in their party, and in the case of the Republican party it&#x2019;s the Tea Party activists.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>Marin Cogan:</strong> Have you talked to Anthony Weiner lately?</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong>Robert Draper:</strong> We traded emails. He emailed me when the first excerpts of the book were leaked to Politico, and it was a humorous exchange, and further an invitation to have him buy me a drink when I got to New York. But then the <em>New York Post</em> started really beating up on him and hyperbolizing what was in my book and I never quite received that invitation from Weiner. I talked to Jon Stewart back stage about it in the green room. Stewart has known him a long time, and he thought Weiner probably felt okay about the book because in Stewart&#x2019;s view treatment of Weiner was more than fair. But I&#x2019;ve come to believe that people don&#x2019;t want to just be treated fairly. They want to be rhapsodized over or exonerated.</p><p data-reactid=".249q9piuccg.1.1.0.0.4.v"><a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/blogs/death-race"><strong>Read more from Death Race
