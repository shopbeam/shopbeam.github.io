  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Less than an hour after I meet the vetter for the first time, he asks me if I\u0027ve always been faithful to my wife. Next he wants to know if I\u0027ve ever been accused of sexual harassment. And then whether I\u0027ve ever paid for sex. Before long he\u0027s asking me about any past history I might have with sadomasochism. Internet-porn memberships? Sexting? We are on the top floor of an anonymous glass-and-steel office building in Washington, D.C.—the kind of place where, far more than the marble halls of Congress, the real business of America\u0027s capital gets done. The National Cathedral looms out the window over his shoulder. As he grills me about my sexual history, he does not dull the awkwardness by looking down at his desk and hiding in the papers in front of him. He stares me hard in the eye. So far, I\u0027ve answered \u0022yes\u0022 to the question about my fidelity and \u0022no\u0022 to all of the other ones. I don\u0027t text much, and when I do, it\u0027s usually to my wife, checking on whose turn it is to pick up the kids at preschool. But he is far from done.\u000A\u000A \u0022Have you ever,\u0022 he asks, \u0022had a homosexual encounter?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022No.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Could a rogue IT guy have access to a sex tape or anything like that?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022No.\u0022\u000A\u000A He makes a check mark on his sheet of paper, and then there\u0027s a long pause. I start to think I\u0027m finally out of the woods. But no, he has a follow-up, a loophole in his last question that needs closing. He looks right at me. \u0022Is there a sex tape?\u0022\u000A\u000A No! No to all of it! I am dull as dirt! I\u0027m a happily married dad with pitifully little to hide! So... Why am I so nervous? Why is my heart racing? Have I done something bad? Inquisitions, I\u0027m discovering, are scary even when you\u0027re kind of a square.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Pugilistic New Jersey governor Chris Christie\u000A\u000A The fallout from the Sarah Palin experiment has cast a long shadow over Mitt Romney\u0027s search this summer for a running mate. The list of candidates that his Boston team is rumored to be vetting—which includes Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, Ohio senator Rob Portman, and former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty—does not feature any game changers, at least none on the order of Palin. In fact, the conventional wisdom around Washington is that Romney will go with an anti-Palin—or as one GOP official told Politico in May, an \u0022incredibly boring white guy.\u0022 The \u0022white guy\u0022 part should be easy enough to verify. But when it comes to \u0022incredibly boring,\u0022 well, reckless people sometimes come in the dullest packages. Just ask Larry Craig. In this post-Palin season, the Romney campaign is surely conducting the most exhaustive vet in political history to make sure the boss\u0027s running mate is every bit as bland as advertised.\u000A\u000A To get a sense of how it feels to have your life history poked, probed, and peeled back, GQ sent me to Washington so I could be put through the wringer myself. \u0022You just have to know going in,\u0022 former Indiana senator Evan Bayh told me, \u0022that it\u0027s totally invasive. It\u0027s like having a colonoscopy, except they use the Hubble telescope on you.\u0022 Until he retired from the Senate in 2010, Bayh was just the sort of bland yet ambitious Democrat who invariably wound up on vice presidential lists before invariably getting passed over for someone else. Al Gore, John Kerry, and Barack Obama all considered him; according to Obama\u0027s 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, Bayh lost out to Joe Biden on \u0022a coin toss.\u0022 (Biden\u0027s foreign-policy experience—which shored up a perceived liability for Obama—was widely seen as the difference maker.)\u000A\u000A A few hours before my first meeting with my vetter, I visited Bayh at his K Street lobbying firm. He\u0027d been through repeated vets, all for naught, so I figured he might have some expert advice for me. \u0022There are some catchall questions at the very end,\u0022 he warned, recalling something Obama put to him directly during their top-secret meeting at a St. Louis hotel. (Bayh rode the freight elevator to the room.) \u0022He said, \u0027Look, they\u0027re talking to people I went to first grade with, so if there\u0027s anything about you that we haven\u0027t asked that\u0027s going to come out, you should tell me.\u0027 I said, \u0027Well, there are one or two things I should probably tell you about,\u0027 and I did.\u0022 Bayh declined to share with me what he revealed to Obama, but it sounds like they weren\u0027t exactly smoking guns: \u0022[Obama] said, \u0027That\u0027s it? Well, you haven\u0027t lived much of a life, have you?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A The man who was conducting my vet, Ted Frank, built his career as an attorney defending automakers and pharmaceutical giants from product-liability suits. Now he represents consumers who are dissatisfied with class-action settlements. The next time a Republican takes the White House, he\u0027ll probably get an important Justice Department job, maybe even a federal judgeship. He is 43, has slicked-back hair, favors dark suits, and looks altogether like a member of the Federalist Society, which he is.\u000A\u000A In April 2008, a colleague at his old law firm, O\u0027Melveny Myers, asked Frank if he wanted to work on a sensitive matter: helping John McCain find a running mate. The firm\u0027s then chairman, A. B. Culvahouse Jr., had been tasked with the job and needed assistance. Along with a team of about thirty other lawyers, Frank spent the next five months poring over the private lives, voting records, and tax returns of Joe Lieberman and Sarah Palin, among others. He was now a veep vetter—one of a handful of dirt-diggers and interrogators who, every four years, help fill out the bottom half of presidential tickets.\u000A\u000A And in short order, Frank would become a minor political celebrity as well: He was the author of what is surely the most infamous document in veep-vetting history—the forty-five-page report he produced on Palin, assembled over the course of forty-three frantic hours in August after she was added at the last minute to McCain\u0027s short list. If you\u0027ve seen Game Change, the HBO movie about the Palin soap opera, Frank is played by Brian d\u0027Arcy James, who doesn\u0027t have any speaking lines but does a very good job of looking so nervous and exhausted that he might puke.\u000A\u000A Technically my vet—a junior-varsity version of the real thing—had already begun a few weeks before our first meeting, when Frank sent me a fifty-four-part biographical questionnaire. Most of the information required was reasonably mundane: my mother-in-law\u0027s birthday, my Selective Service number, a list of foreign countries I\u0027d visited \u0022other than for vacation or a governmental capacity.\u0022 (Translation: Had I perhaps adopted a child and/or fomented a revolution in Honduras?) Of course, my questionnaire wasn\u0027t as extensive as the seventy-nine-part document Frank and his colleagues had sent to McCain\u0027s potential veeps four years ago. I\u0027m not a politician, so I have no voting record to dissect or speeches to review. Also, as a journalist, my financial situation—unlike that of the average senator, whose net worth is around $2.5 million—is depressingly straightforward. Save for a few questions (like, say, number 31: \u0022Have you ever used marijuana, cocaine, narcotics, hallucinogenics, or other illegal drugs? If yes, please identify the substance(s) used, the time period and frequency of use, and any other details you deem relevant....\u0022), the questionnaire was more irritating to complete (do you remember your SAT scores?) than invasive.\u000A\u000A The in-person meeting, on the other hand, is very different. It starts unobtrusively enough. \u0022So you\u0027re the vice president, and the president is visiting Seoul,\u0022 Frank begins, unspooling an elaborate scenario in which the president\u0027s hotel gets decimated by a car bomb, 200,000 North Korean troops cross the DMZ, and the Joint Chiefs urge me to take out Pyongyang with a tactical nuclear weapon. \u0022Do you authorize the strike?\u0022 he asks, trying to get a sense of my political judgment (as much a part of the vet now as excavating secrets). I wonder if the question is also a reaction to Frank\u0027s Palin experience, recalling the scene in Game Change in which Palin reveals that she doesn\u0027t even know that there are two Koreas. But I push those thoughts aside and dodge the question by asking for more military options, trying to cover my fecklessness by name-dropping Seal Team Six. Next, Frank hits me with an easier hypothetical, about a deadlocked Senate and a Supreme Court nominee who appears to be against gay marriage. \u0022Do you support the president and cast the tiebreaker in favor of the president\u0027s nominee?\u0022 he asks. Of course I do, I respond. I\u0027m a team player. The president can always count on me. \u000A\u000A As I field Frank\u0027s softballs—\u0022What would your professors and classmates say about your performance at Swarthmore?\u0022—I begin to think that maybe Bayh isn\u0027t just boring, he\u0027s also a wuss. Colonoscopy? Hubble telescope? Come on. This isn\u0027t so bad! In my head, I\u0027m already measuring the hypothetical drapes in the hypothetical West Wing office I\u0027ll hypothetically demand when Frank\u0027s hypothetical boss begs me to be his hypothetical running mate.\u000A\u000A But then Frank\u0027s questions take a sudden turn. We are no longer talking about my junior-year Gothic-art-and-architecture seminar. Now it\u0027s my sex life. And my drug history. And the lowest moments of my journalism career. \u0022It\u0027s an intrusive process,\u0022 Frank advised me at the outset, \u0022but if you\u0027ve lived a clean life, it won\u0027t be that embarrassing for either of us.\u0022 Easy for him to say.\u000A\u000A  _Men Who Might\u0027ve Behaved Badly\u000A\u000A If you were vetting the politicians rumored to be on Mitt Romney\u0027s vice presidential short list, where would you start digging? Here\u0027s Ted Frank\u0027s take._ \u000A\u000A Chris Christie\u000A\u000A governor, New Jersey \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A The Risk Area\u000A\u000A Prosecutorial deal-making\u000A\u000A \u0022As a U.S. attorney, Christie negotiated at least one deferred agreement where a defendant gave money to Christie\u0027s alma mater and avoided criminal prosecution.\u0022 Are there more?\u000A\u000A John Thune\u000A\u000A U.S. senator, South Dakota \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A The Risk Area\u000A\u000A Religious affiliations\u000A\u000A Though Frank believes it\u0027s probably harmless, he\u0027d want to check into Thune\u0027s membership in \u0022The Family,\u0022 a secretive Christian influence group. Could spook independent voters.\u000A\u000A Rob Portman\u000A\u000A U.S. senator, Ohio\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A The Risk Area\u000A\u000A Ties to Bush 43\u000A\u000A He was Bush\u0027s budget director, and that name\u0027s still radioactive.

Also, he\u0027d scrutinize Jindal\u0027s ties to trial lawyers.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A \u0022No skeletons rattling in your closet?\u0022\u000A\u000A With those six words, the process of selecting vice presidents changed forever, giving birth to an entire veep-vetting industry and, eventually, to multipart questions about sex tapes.\u000A\u000A It was the afternoon of July 13, 1972—the last day of the Democratic National Convention—and Frank Mankiewicz, the political director for George McGovern\u0027s presidential campaign, was on the phone with Missouri senator Thomas Eagleton. Moments earlier, the party\u0027s newly minted nominee had placed a call from his Miami hotel suite to Eagleton\u0027s room two miles away and offered him the number two spot on the ticket. \u0022George, before you change your mind, I accept,\u0022 Eagleton replied, surrounded by family, friends, and reporters. Now, as Joshua Glasser recounts in his new book The Eighteen-Day Running Mate, Mankiewicz had come on the line to do a little pro forma housekeeping.\u000A\u000A For years, this was how veep vetting was done. Which is to say, not done. Until 1944, when FDR dumped Henry Wallace for Harry Truman, the presidential candidate didn\u0027t even pick his own running mate; that job typically fell to convention delegates. Even after Roosevelt changed the game, the selection process was still informal and ad hoc—partly because it tended to happen at the last minute, with the top of the ticket not being decided until the convention, but also because of etiquette. Politicians just weren\u0027t in the habit of asking one another nosy personal questions. \u0022I\u0027m a United States senator,\u0022 Alabama segregationist John Sparkman, who was Adlai Stevenson\u0027s 1952 running mate, later told McGovern about his gentle vetting. \u0022I\u0027m not going to be interrogated on my personal life.\u0022\u000A\u000A Then came Tom Eagleton. When Mankiewicz asked him if he had any skeletons—or rather, sought reassurance that he didn\u0027t—Eagleton failed to mention that he\u0027d been hospitalized three times for depression and had received electroshock therapy. Almost immediately after Eagleton was added to the ticket, the information leaked to the media, causing a firestorm. \u0022Since you have conceded election to Nixon by selection of a psychotic running mate,\u0022 one irate Democratic donor wrote in a telegram to McGovern, \u0022I would like a refund of money contributed when you were a viable candidate.\u0022 McGovern had to dump Eagleton less than three weeks later.\u000A\u000A The Eagleton debacle was still fresh in Jimmy Carter\u0027s mind by the time he effectively wrapped up the Democratic presidential nomination in April 1976. He tapped his consigliere, Georgia lawyer Charlie Kirbo, to dig up as much information as he could about the seven men he was considering for VP. Kirbo conducted extensive background interviews, requested tax returns and medical histories, then met with each prospective candidate in person. Walter Mondale still remembers the day Kirbo showed up in his Senate office and didn\u0027t leave for three hours. \u0022He came in with a yellow legal pad full of questions, and he hit me with everything he could think of,\u0022 Mondale told me. \u0022When it was over, I felt like I\u0027d passed some sort of test. I wasn\u0027t going to jail.\u0022 Mondale had one subsequent meeting with Carter, and then he was on the ticket.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A  Former Minnesota governor (and vanquished Romney foe) Tim Pawlenty  \u000A\u000A There\u0027s very little about Jimmy Carter that American politicians emulate now, but his vetting process set the standard. To this day, future presidents themselves don\u0027t face the level of scrutiny experienced by their potential veeps. \u0022Even when you run for office, nobody has access to everything you give them when you go through the vetting,\u0022 Bayh says. The clever dodges that can rescue a presidential candidacy—Bill Clinton answering adultery allegations by saying he\u0027d \u0022caused pain\u0022 in his marriage; George W. Bush addressing cocaine use by saying, \u0022When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible\u0022—won\u0027t cut it in a veep vet. Every affair, every line of blow, has to be disclosed and explained in detail. For some politicians, the scrutiny can be too much. Former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, who ran for the White House in 2008, declined to be considered for the job of John Kerry\u0027s running mate in 2004. \u0022Richardson wanted to be mentioned,\u0022 Bob Shrum, Kerry\u0027s top strategist, told me, \u0022but he didn\u0027t want to go through the vetting.\u0022 Considering the ethical cloud that now hangs over Richardson—who\u0027s spent the past three years dealing with corruption and adultery allegations—that was probably a prudent move.\u000A\u000A Politicians who do subject themselves to a veep vet soon find it taking over their lives. When Bayh was under consideration by Obama, he had been suffering from a stomach ailment that, despite his doctors\u0027 best efforts—cancer tests, full-body imaging, radioisotope gastric-emptying scans—remained undiagnosed. Obama\u0027s vetting team, led by Eric Holder, demanded an answer. \u0022They wanted to make sure I wasn\u0027t dying,\u0022 Bayh says now. He wasn\u0027t. After several thousand dollars more for tests and a trip to a specialist in Massachusetts—Bayh had to pay for all of it—he finally got a diagnosis: adult-onset gluten sensitivity. And then he didn\u0027t get the job.\u000A\u000A Until Palin came along, the most notorious vetting saga was the 2000 Republican process led by Dick Cheney, who, of course, ended up recommending himself. In that year, Cheney vetted at least ten potential running mates for George W. Bush, including then Oklahoma governor Frank Keating. Keating was a former FBI agent, and by 2000 he\u0027d been through four separate Senate confirmation processes. In other words, he was used to people poking around in his life. But nothing prepared him for the scope of Cheney\u0027s inquiry. The questionnaire contained nearly 200 questions under seventy-nine headings. In addition to the typical queries about infidelity, drug use, and psychiatric treatment, Keating was also asked whether there was anything in his past or present that might make him \u0022vulnerable to blackmail or coercion.\u0022 Cheney even required Keating to sign a notarized authorization for \u0022Richard B. Cheney or...any person designated by him\u0022 to obtain \u0022all information and records relating to my physical or mental health...during any time period.\u0022\u000A\u000A Keating\u0027s responses totaled more than a thousand pages and filled two massive three-ring binders, which he generously lugged out of storage when I visited him at his Washington office, where he now works as the president of the American Bankers Association. As we flipped through the files twelve years later, Keating was still in awe of the undertaking. (\u0022Just stunning,\u0022 he said.) He was also bitter. For one thing, he felt like he was never really being considered; after he submitted his binders, he didn\u0027t hear again from the Bush campaign until seven weeks later—when Bush called to tell Keating that he\u0027d picked Cheney. \u0022There was never even a follow-up question or a phone call,\u0022 he groused. \u0022To make people go through that kind of labor—and you\u0027re not even pregnant—was no fun.\u0022\u000A\u000A Even worse was what happened after Bush was elected. Keating was up for attorney general, but Cheney reportedly favored John Ashcroft for the job. Keating\u0027s chances ultimately flamed out over some financial details—specifically, $250,000 in personal (and perfectly legal) gifts he\u0027d accepted from an eccentric philanthropist friend—that he had disclosed during his vet. As Keating told Barton Gellman for his book about Cheney, Angler, \u0022It obviously came from Dick Cheney or one of his people.... To say that it was chickenshit, excuse the expression, is an understatement.... Dick Cheney coming into my life has been like a black cloud.\u0022 When he saw me, Keating went for a joke. \u0022I gave Cheney all of that,\u0022 he said, nodding to the binders, \u0022and he\u0027s never even sent me a Christmas card.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The first rule of being a veep vetter—if you\u0027re not Dick Cheney, anyway—is that you do not talk about being a veep vetter. So Ted Frank is wary of saying too much about his Sarah Palin experience. Still, he knows the perception is out there that his team blew it. When I told Evan Bayh that the guy who vetted Palin was vetting me, he replied with a smirk, \u0022I\u0027m not sure that\u0027d be the place I\u0027d go to for a strenuous vet.\u0022\u000A\u000A And yet Frank insists that the Palin vet was exhaustive, even considering the unhelpful circumstances. Working under terrible time pressure, as well as constraints imposed by the McCain campaign\u0027s secrecy concerns—to avoid tipping off anyone that Palin was under consideration, the vetters didn\u0027t interview anyone outside of her staff about her—Frank submitted a forty-five-page report cataloging almost everything that would eventually dog her on the campaign trail. Todd Palin\u0027s DUI arrest (which she revealed on the questionnaire), her teenage daughter Bristol\u0027s pregnancy (which she confided during a three-hour phone interview with Culvahouse, Frank, and a third vetter), and Troopergate (which Frank pieced together through public documents and conversations with Palin\u0027s private attorney) were all uncovered by the vet. The only thing the report missed was Todd\u0027s membership in the Alaska Independence Party.\u000A\u000A \u0022We had things in there that never came out,\u0022 Frank tells me. \u0022We had things that Palin didn\u0027t even know about.\u0022 Still, Frank admits he saw the same upside in Palin that McCain\u0027s political team did. \u0022I wasn\u0027t sick to my stomach about her,\u0022 he says, getting in a dig at the portrayal of him on HBO. After all, it was Frank\u0027s vetting report that his boss, Culvahouse, was largely relying upon when he offered up to McCain his assessment of Palin\u0027s potential as a running mate: \u0022High risk, high reward.\u0022\u000A\u000A Occasionally during our first meeting, I get the sense that Frank has taken on my vet as a shot at redemption—to show the world, which will likely never see the Palin report, that he\u0027s a pro at this. On my questionnaire, I\u0027d copped to smoking way too much pot in college. Now Frank asks me to elaborate. I recall for him my sophomore year and my job as a pizza deliverer, which involved my getting stoned with some co-workers and then driving pies to customers.\u000A\u000A \u0022Have you ever been pulled over for driving impaired?\u0022 Frank asks.\u000A\u000A \u0022Nope, never,\u0022 I reply.\u000A\u000A \u0022Have you ever had an auto accident that was caused where anyone was hurt?\u0022 No, I say—but I do mention the telephone pole I backed into one night. He moves on to more fertile territory. On my questionnaire, I wrote that I had \u0022supplied\u0022 pot to friends. Frank smells blood.\u000A\u000A \u0022I want to go into the verb supplied,\u0022 he says. \u0022What did that entail?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Letting friends use it,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A \u0022How much were you purchasing and distributing?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Not much.\u0022 I explain that I never actually purchased the pot myself but would pay back a friend who bought it for me.\u000A\u000A \u0022How much were you spending, say, a month?\u0022 Frank asks.\u000A\u000A \u0022Not more than fifty bucks,\u0022 I reply, explaining that I didn\u0027t need to spend more because I could usually just smoke my friends\u0027. I have no troublesome history of dealing weed—just mooching it. Based on Frank\u0027s bemused expression, I gather this is not a fatal character flaw, at least for a potential veep.\u000A\u000A Next he zeroes in on a woman my wife and I had hired a couple of years ago to clean our apartment occasionally.\u000A\u000A \u0022Was she an American citizen?\u0022 Frank wants to know.\u000A\u000A \u0022I never asked,\u0022 I tell him, though I note that she spoke English with a Portuguese accent.\u000A\u000A \u0022Did she have a green card?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I never looked. I never inquired.\u0022\u000A\u000A Frank asks the same questions about a babysitter who would occasionally pick up our son at preschool when my wife and I were busy at work. She spoke unaccented English, but when Frank asks if we gave her a 1099 tax form, I admit that we didn\u0027t.\u000A\u000A \u0022Did you pay her more than $600 a year?\u0022\u000A\u000A Yes, I think we did. Frank\u0027s eyebrows arch.\u000A\u000A \u0022So, potentially, a few tax problems,\u0022 he says, scribbling on his sheet of paper.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A  Louisiana governor (and Indian-American political trailblazer) Bobby Jindal  \u000A\u000A On issue after issue, Frank digs and quickly hits bedrock. He doesn\u0027t just want to know whether I was bar mitzvahed but also whether we had a bris for our son. Yes to both. He turns up a particularly tasteless haiku I\u0027d written for my college humor magazine—\u0022the blood stained carpet / reeks of brains and gun powder / smells like teen spirit\u0022 (sorry)—and wonders if there are more. There aren\u0027t. He even gets into what I\u0027ve dressed up as for Halloween: \u0022Are there photos of you, or can anybody testify about or make claims about you doing something offensive, dressing up as a Nazi or something racist or sexist?\u0022 Nope.\u000A\u000A Finally, Frank gets to the question Bayh had warned me about: \u0022Is there anything I haven\u0027t asked you that might come out in Gawker or Daily Kos or some horrible right-wing blog?\u0022 I decide to confess the big family secret: that my octogenarian grandfather was once a bookie connected to the Philadelphia mob and was convicted of illegal gambling activity. (His sentence: probation, plus he had to have a party telephone line in his house for a number of years.) Even this, to my surprise, doesn\u0027t faze Frank. Too long ago. He tells me that he\u0027ll hire an investigator to interview my friends, enemies, even an ex-girlfriend, to look into a few of the potential problems the vet has raised. But he appears convinced that there\u0027s no deep dark secret—much less a sex tape—to be found. Of course, that doesn\u0027t necessarily make me fit to fill Spiro Agnew\u0027s shoes.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A \u0022The problem with these vetting processes,\u0022 Bob Shrum had told me, \u0022is that you\u0027re always vetting for the last problem.\u0022 After Eagleton, for instance, everyone was on the lookout for medical anomalies; after Dan Quayle, vetters fixated on draft records. But a good vetter doesn\u0027t just take cues from the past; he anticipates fresh dangers.\u000A\u000A Frank tells me that if he were vetting veep prospects for Mitt Romney, he knows exactly where he\u0027d dig carefully: mortgages. \u0022Someone could get tripped up by a liar loan,\u0022 he says, referring to mortgages in which the borrower overstates his or her income. Given how prevalent the practice was during the housing bubble, Frank thinks it\u0027s possible that somebody on Romney\u0027s list did it, especially if he hails from a state where the bubble was especially outrageous. (Like, say, Florida or Nevada.)\u000A\u000A Similarly, Frank says he\u0027d spend a lot of time on a potential Romney veep\u0027s religious beliefs—and not just their current ones. Has the candidate always been an evangelical (John Thune) or a Catholic (Chris Christie)? Or has his path been circuitous, like that of Marco Rubio, who spent his childhood as a Mormon before converting to, and sticking with, Catholicism? Spiritual questing could be a problem, Frank explains, \u0022because there\u0027s going to be skepticism about Romney\u0027s religion, and you don\u0027t want skepticism about both halves of the ticket.\u0022\u000A\u000A Peering even farther into the future, Frank wonders about the types of questions that will be asked of the potential veeps in 2020 and beyond—people who are now in their twenties and thirties. \u0022Right now the politicians we\u0027re dealing with are largely people who married their high school or college sweetheart,\u0022 he says. \u0022They don\u0027t have a history of being single in their twenties.\u0022 The next generation of politicians probably will, which means vetters will want to know more about their sex lives as single adults. \u0022Are there whips? Are there chains? To what extent do people kiss and tell?\u0022 Frank wonders. \u0022We\u0027re learning with the David Maraniss book, here\u0027s Obama\u0027s ex-girlfriend turning over her diaries. And here\u0027s one of Christine O\u0027Donnell\u0027s former hookups going to Gawker. I think future vetters are going to have to think about this.\u0022\u000A\u000A And what about me? Am I vice presidential material? When we meet for the final time, Frank tells me that his investigator didn\u0027t turn up much. Even one of my es had mostly nice things to say about me. A college pal told the investigator something I\u0027d forgotten—that I\u0027d named my bong after my grandfather—but Frank doesn\u0027t care about that. What does he care about? Well... My tax returns showed that I\u0027ve made very few charitable contributions. (\u0022There\u0027d be a one-day story about how you don\u0027t give much.\u0022) My financial records revealed that I have way too much money in my checking account. (\u0022Someone\u0027s going to say, \u0027Oh, he doesn\u0027t know how to manage his money. How can somebody who clearly knows so little be put in charge of our economy?\u0027 \u0022) My medical history disclosed that ten years ago I had testicular cancer. (\u0022People understand that.\u0022) My college drug use. (\u0022Ideally, you\u0027re a politician already and somebody\u0027s asked you six years ago, and you said, \u0027Oh yeah, I used in college and I stopped after.\u0027 \u0022) My grandfather. (The bookmaking, not the bong I named after him. \u0022It comes up as an interesting story, but it doesn\u0027t get used against you. We have somebody research that and then feed it to a journalist: \u0027Hey, here\u0027s an interesting slice of Americana.\u0027 \u0022)\u000A\u000A \u0022Skipping over the fact that you have no experience and we don\u0027t know where you stand on any issues,\u0022 Frank says, it turns out my biggest problems are two that hadn\u0027t even crossed my mind: the tas we haven\u0027t paid on babysitters, and the housecleaner who might\u0027ve been here illegally. Frank sums up the report he\u0027d give to the guy at the top of the ticket. \u0022We would say, \u0027He\u0027s got the domestic-help issue, and that has torpedoed candidacies in the past. You\u0027re going to have to make a judgment call, Governor, whether you want Jason Zengerle enough to weather that storm.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A The real problem with Jason Zengerle, though, is one that Frank is too polite to say to me: I\u0027m too boring—even for Mitt Romney. I\u0027m Tim Pawlenty without the truck-driver father. I\u0027m John Thune minus the tan. I\u0027m Rob Portman without Ohio\u0027s eighteen electoral votes. There\u0027s no getting around what I am, and in modern politics, it\u0027s a killer: low risk, low reward.\u000A\u000A Jason Zengerle is a GQ contributing editor.",

Next he wants to know if I&apos;ve ever been accused of sexual harassment. And then whether I&apos;ve ever paid for sex. Before long he&apos;s asking me about any past history I might have with sadomasochism. Internet-porn memberships? Sexting? We are on the top floor of an anonymous glass-and-steel office building in Washington, D.C.&#x2014;the kind of place where, far more than the marble halls of Congress, the real business of America&apos;s capital gets done. The National Cathedral looms out the window over his shoulder. As he grills me about my sexual history, he does not dull the awkwardness by looking down at his desk and hiding in the papers in front of him. He stares me hard in the eye. So far, I&apos;ve answered &quot;yes&quot; to the question about my fidelity and &quot;no&quot; to all of the other ones. I don&apos;t text much, and when I do, it&apos;s usually to my wife, checking on whose turn it is to pick up the kids at preschool. But he is far from done.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2"> &quot;Have you ever,&quot; he asks, &quot;had a homosexual encounter?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.3"> &quot;No.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.5"> &quot;Could a rogue IT guy have access to a sex tape or anything like that?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.6"> &quot;No.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.7"> He makes a check mark on his sheet of paper, and then there&apos;s a long pause.

The list of candidates that his Boston team is rumored to be vetting&#x2014;which includes Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, Ohio senator Rob Portman, and former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty&#x2014;does not feature any game changers, at least none on the order of Palin. In fact, the conventional wisdom around Washington is that Romney will go with an anti-Palin&#x2014;or as one GOP official told <em>Politico</em> in May, an &quot;incredibly boring white guy.&quot; The &quot;white guy&quot; part should be easy enough to verify. But when it comes to &quot;incredibly boring,&quot; well, reckless people sometimes come in the dullest packages. Just ask Larry Craig. In this post-Palin season, the Romney campaign is surely conducting the most exhaustive vet in political history to make sure the boss&apos;s running mate is every bit as bland as advertised.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.d"> To get a sense of how it feels to have your life history poked, probed, and peeled back, <em>GQ</em> sent me to Washington so I could be put through the wringer myself. &quot;You just have to know going in,&quot; former Indiana senator Evan Bayh told me, &quot;that it&apos;s totally invasive. It&apos;s like having a colonoscopy, except they use the Hubble telescope on you.&quot; Until he retired from the Senate in 2010, Bayh was just the sort of bland yet ambitious Democrat who invariably wound up on vice presidential lists before invariably getting passed over for someone else. Al Gore, John Kerry, and Barack Obama all considered him; according to Obama&apos;s 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, Bayh lost out to Joe Biden on &quot;a coin toss.&quot; (Biden&apos;s foreign-policy experience&#x2014;which shored up a perceived liability for Obama&#x2014;was widely seen as the difference maker.)</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.e"> A few hours before my first meeting with my vetter, I visited Bayh at his K Street lobbying firm. He&apos;d been through repeated vets, all for naught, so I figured he might have some expert advice for me. &quot;There are some catchall questions at the very end,&quot; he warned, recalling something Obama put to him directly during their top-secret meeting at a St. Louis hotel. (Bayh rode the freight elevator to the room.) &quot;He said, &apos;Look, they&apos;re talking to people I went to first grade with, so if there&apos;s anything about you that we haven&apos;t asked that&apos;s going to come out, you should tell me.&apos; I said, &apos;Well, there are one or two things I should probably tell you about,&apos; and I did.&quot; Bayh declined to share with me what he revealed to Obama, but it sounds like they weren&apos;t exactly smoking guns: &quot;[Obama] said, &apos;That&apos;s it? Well, you haven&apos;t lived much of a life, have you?&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.f"> The man who was conducting my vet, Ted Frank, built his career as an attorney defending automakers and pharmaceutical giants from product-liability suits. Now he represents consumers who are dissatisfied with class-action settlements. The next time a Republican takes the White House, he&apos;ll probably get an important Justice Department job, maybe even a federal judgeship. He is 43, has slicked-back hair, favors dark suits, and looks altogether like a member of the Federalist Society, which he is.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.g"> In April 2008, a colleague at his old law firm, O&apos;Melveny Myers, asked Frank if he wanted to work on a sensitive matter: helping John McCain find a running mate. The firm&apos;s then chairman, A. B. Culvahouse Jr., had been tasked with the job and needed assistance. Along with a team of about thirty other lawyers, Frank spent the next five months poring over the private lives, voting records, and tax returns of Joe Lieberman and Sarah Palin, among others. He was now a veep vetter&#x2014;one of a handful of dirt-diggers and interrogators who, every four years, help fill out the bottom half of presidential tickets.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.h"> And in short order, Frank would become a minor political celebrity as well: He was the author of what is surely the most infamous document in veep-vetting history&#x2014;the forty-five-page report he produced on Palin, assembled over the course of forty-three frantic hours in August after she was added at the last minute to McCain&apos;s short list. If you&apos;ve seen <em>Game Change</em>, the HBO movie about the Palin soap opera, Frank is played by Brian d&apos;Arcy James, who doesn&apos;t have any speaking lines but does a very good job of looking so nervous and exhausted that he might puke.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.i"> Technically my vet&#x2014;a junior-varsity version of the real thing&#x2014;had already begun a few weeks before our first meeting, when Frank sent me a fifty-four-part biographical questionnaire. Most of the information required was reasonably mundane: my mother-in-law&apos;s birthday, my Selective Service number, a list of foreign countries I&apos;d visited &quot;other than for vacation or a governmental capacity.&quot; (Translation: Had I perhaps adopted a child and/or fomented a revolution in Honduras?) Of course, my questionnaire wasn&apos;t as extensive as the seventy-nine-part document Frank and his colleagues had sent to McCain&apos;s potential veeps four years ago. I&apos;m not a politician, so I have no voting record to dissect or speeches to review. Also, as a journalist, my financial situation&#x2014;unlike that of the average senator, whose net worth is around $2.5 million&#x2014;is depressingly straightforward. Save for a few questions (like, say, number 31: &quot;Have you ever used marijuana, cocaine, narcotics, hallucinogenics, or other illegal drugs? If yes, please identify the substance(s) used, the time period and frequency of use, and any other details you deem relevant....&quot;), the questionnaire was more irritating to complete (do <em>you</em> remember your SAT scores?) than invasive.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.j"> The in-person meeting, on the other hand, is very different. It starts unobtrusively enough. &quot;So you&apos;re the vice president, and the president is visiting Seoul,&quot; Frank begins, unspooling an elaborate scenario in which the president&apos;s hotel gets decimated by a car bomb, 200,000 North Korean troops cross the DMZ, and the Joint Chiefs urge me to take out Pyongyang with a tactical nuclear weapon. &quot;Do you authorize the strike?&quot; he asks, trying to get a sense of my political judgment (as much a part of the vet now as excavating secrets). I wonder if the question is also a reaction to Frank&apos;s Palin experience, recalling the scene in <em>Game Change</em> in which Palin reveals that she doesn&apos;t even know that there are two Koreas. But I push those thoughts aside and dodge the question by asking for more military options, trying to cover my fecklessness by name-dropping Seal Team Six. Next, Frank hits me with an easier hypothetical, about a deadlocked Senate and a Supreme Court nominee who appears to be against gay marriage. &quot;Do you support the president and cast the tiebreaker in favor of the president&apos;s nominee?&quot; he asks. <em>Of course I do</em>, I respond. <em>I&apos;m a team player. The president can always count on me. </em></p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.k"> As I field Frank&apos;s softballs&#x2014;&quot;What would your professors and classmates say about your performance at Swarthmore?&quot;&#x2014;I begin to think that maybe Bayh isn&apos;t just boring, he&apos;s also a wuss. Colonoscopy? Hubble telescope? Come on. This isn&apos;t so bad! In my head, I&apos;m already measuring the hypothetical drapes in the hypothetical West Wing office I&apos;ll hypothetically demand when Frank&apos;s hypothetical boss begs me to be his hypothetical running mate.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.l"> But then Frank&apos;s questions take a sudden turn.

Moments earlier, the party&apos;s newly minted nominee had placed a call from his Miami hotel suite to Eagleton&apos;s room two miles away and offered him the number two spot on the ticket. &quot;George, before you change your mind, I accept,&quot; Eagleton replied, surrounded by family, friends, and reporters. Now, as Joshua Glasser recounts in his new book <em>The Eighteen-Day Running Mate</em>, Mankiewicz had come on the line to do a little pro forma housekeeping.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.1s"> For years, this was how veep vetting was done. Which is to say, not done. Until 1944, when FDR dumped Henry Wallace for Harry Truman, the presidential candidate didn&apos;t even pick his own running mate; that job typically fell to convention delegates. Even after Roosevelt changed the game, the selection process was still informal and ad hoc&#x2014;partly because it tended to happen at the last minute, with the top of the ticket not being decided until the convention, but also because of etiquette. Politicians just weren&apos;t in the habit of asking one another nosy personal questions. &quot;I&apos;m a United States senator,&quot; Alabama segregationist John Sparkman, who was Adlai Stevenson&apos;s 1952 running mate, later told McGovern about his gentle vetting. &quot;I&apos;m not going to be interrogated on my personal life.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.1t"> Then came Tom Eagleton. When Mankiewicz asked him if he had any skeletons&#x2014;or rather, sought reassurance that he didn&apos;t&#x2014;Eagleton failed to mention that he&apos;d been hospitalized three times for depression and had received electroshock therapy. Almost immediately after Eagleton was added to the ticket, the information leaked to the media, causing a firestorm. &quot;Since you have conceded election to Nixon by selection of a psychotic running mate,&quot; one irate Democratic donor wrote in a telegram to McGovern, &quot;I would like a refund of money contributed when you were a viable candidate.&quot; McGovern had to dump Eagleton less than three weeks later.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.1u"> The Eagleton debacle was still fresh in Jimmy Carter&apos;s mind by the time he effectively wrapped up the Democratic presidential nomination in April 1976. He tapped his consigliere, Georgia lawyer Charlie Kirbo, to dig up as much information as he could about the seven men he was considering for VP. Kirbo conducted extensive background interviews, requested tax returns and medical histories, then met with each prospective candidate in person. Walter Mondale still remembers the day Kirbo showed up in his Senate office and didn&apos;t leave for three hours. &quot;He came in with a yellow legal pad full of questions, and he hit me with everything he could think of,&quot; Mondale told me. &quot;When it was over, I felt like I&apos;d passed some sort of test. I wasn&apos;t going to jail.&quot; Mondale had one subsequent meeting with Carter, and then he was on the ticket.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.1v"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558307a43655c24c6c9573bb/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-tim-pawlenty.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-tim-pawlenty.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmitt-romney-vice-president-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-tim-pawlenty.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmitt-romney-vice-president-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-tim-pawlenty.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmitt-romney-vice-president-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558307a43655c24c6c9573bb%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-tim-pawlenty.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-tim-pawlenty.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmitt-romney-vice-president-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558307a43655c24c6c9573bb%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-tim-pawlenty.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-tim-pawlenty.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.1w">  Former Minnesota governor (and vanquished Romney foe) Tim Pawlenty  </p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.1x"> There&apos;s very little about Jimmy Carter that American politicians emulate now, but his vetting process set the standard. To this day, future presidents themselves don&apos;t face the level of scrutiny experienced by their potential veeps. &quot;Even when you run for office, nobody has access to everything you give them when you go through the vetting,&quot; Bayh says. The clever dodges that can rescue a presidential candidacy&#x2014;Bill Clinton answering adultery allegations by saying he&apos;d &quot;caused pain&quot; in his marriage; George W. Bush addressing cocaine use by saying, &quot;When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and irresponsible&quot;&#x2014;won&apos;t cut it in a veep vet. Every affair, every line of blow, has to be disclosed and explained in detail. For some politicians, the scrutiny can be too much. Former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, who ran for the White House in 2008, declined to be considered for the job of John Kerry&apos;s running mate in 2004. &quot;Richardson wanted to be mentioned,&quot; Bob Shrum, Kerry&apos;s top strategist, told me, &quot;but he didn&apos;t want to go through the vetting.&quot; Considering the ethical cloud that now hangs over Richardson&#x2014;who&apos;s spent the past three years dealing with corruption and adultery allegations&#x2014;that was probably a prudent move.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.1y"> Politicians who do subject themselves to a veep vet soon find it taking over their lives. When Bayh was under consideration by Obama, he had been suffering from a stomach ailment that, despite his doctors&apos; best efforts&#x2014;cancer tests, full-body imaging, radioisotope gastric-emptying scans&#x2014;remained undiagnosed. Obama&apos;s vetting team, led by Eric Holder, demanded an answer. &quot;They wanted to make sure I wasn&apos;t dying,&quot; Bayh says now. He wasn&apos;t. After several thousand dollars more for tests and a trip to a specialist in Massachusetts&#x2014;Bayh had to pay for all of it&#x2014;he finally got a diagnosis: adult-onset gluten sensitivity. And then he didn&apos;t get the job.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.1z"> Until Palin came along, the most notorious vetting saga was the 2000 Republican process led by Dick Cheney, who, of course, ended up recommending himself. In that year, Cheney vetted at least ten potential running mates for George W. Bush, including then Oklahoma governor Frank Keating. Keating was a former FBI agent, and by 2000 he&apos;d been through four separate Senate confirmation processes. In other words, he was used to people poking around in his life. But nothing prepared him for the scope of Cheney&apos;s inquiry. The questionnaire contained nearly 200 questions under seventy-nine headings. In addition to the typical queries about infidelity, drug use, and psychiatric treatment, Keating was also asked whether there was anything in his past or present that might make him &quot;vulnerable to blackmail or coercion.&quot; Cheney even required Keating to sign a notarized authorization for &quot;Richard B. Cheney or...any person designated by him&quot; to obtain &quot;all information and records relating to my physical or mental health...during any time period.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.20"> Keating&apos;s responses totaled more than a thousand pages and filled two massive three-ring binders, which he generously lugged out of storage when I visited him at his Washington office, where he now works as the president of the American Bankers Association. As we flipped through the files twelve years later, Keating was still in awe of the undertaking. (&quot;Just stunning,&quot; he said.) He was also bitter. For one thing, he felt like he was never really being considered; after he submitted his binders, he didn&apos;t hear again from the Bush campaign until seven weeks later&#x2014;when Bush called to tell Keating that he&apos;d picked Cheney. &quot;There was never even a follow-up question or a phone call,&quot; he groused. &quot;To make people go through that kind of labor&#x2014;and you&apos;re not even pregnant&#x2014;was no fun.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.21"> Even worse was what happened after Bush was elected. Keating was up for attorney general, but Cheney reportedly favored John Ashcroft for the job. Keating&apos;s chances ultimately flamed out over some financial details&#x2014;specifically, $250,000 in personal (and perfectly legal) gifts he&apos;d accepted from an eccentric philanthropist friend&#x2014;that he had disclosed during his vet. As Keating told Barton Gellman for his book about Cheney, Angler, &quot;It obviously came from Dick Cheney or one of his people.... To say that it was chickenshit, excuse the expression, is an understatement.... Dick Cheney coming into my life has been like a black cloud.&quot; When he saw me, Keating went for a joke. &quot;I gave Cheney all of that,&quot; he said, nodding to the binders, &quot;and he&apos;s never even sent me a Christmas card.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.22">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.23"> The first rule of being a veep vetter&#x2014;if you&apos;re not Dick Cheney, anyway&#x2014;is that you do not talk about being a veep vetter. So Ted Frank is wary of saying too much about his Sarah Palin experience. Still, he knows the perception is out there that his team blew it. When I told Evan Bayh that the guy who vetted Palin was vetting me, he replied with a smirk, &quot;I&apos;m not sure that&apos;d be the place I&apos;d go to for a strenuous vet.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.24"> And yet Frank insists that the Palin vet was exhaustive, even considering the unhelpful circumstances. Working under terrible time pressure, as well as constraints imposed by the McCain campaign&apos;s secrecy concerns&#x2014;to avoid tipping off anyone that Palin was under consideration, the vetters didn&apos;t interview anyone outside of her staff about her&#x2014;Frank submitted a forty-five-page report cataloging almost everything that would eventually dog her on the campaign trail. Todd Palin&apos;s DUI arrest (which she revealed on the questionnaire), her teenage daughter Bristol&apos;s pregnancy (which she confided during a three-hour phone interview with Culvahouse, Frank, and a third vetter), and Troopergate (which Frank pieced together through public documents and conversations with Palin&apos;s private attorney) were all uncovered by the vet. The only thing the report missed was Todd&apos;s membership in the Alaska Independence Party.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.25"> &quot;We had things in there that never came out,&quot; Frank tells me. &quot;We had things that Palin didn&apos;t even know about.&quot; Still, Frank admits he saw the same upside in Palin that McCain&apos;s political team did. &quot;I wasn&apos;t sick to my stomach about her,&quot; he says, getting in a dig at the portrayal of him on HBO. After all, it was Frank&apos;s vetting report that his boss, Culvahouse, was largely relying upon when he offered up to McCain his assessment of Palin&apos;s potential as a running mate: &quot;High risk, high reward.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.26"> Occasionally during our first meeting, I get the sense that Frank has taken on my vet as a shot at redemption&#x2014;to show the world, which will likely never see the Palin report, that he&apos;s a pro at this. On my questionnaire, I&apos;d copped to smoking way too much pot in college. Now Frank asks me to elaborate. I recall for him my sophomore year and my job as a pizza deliverer, which involved my getting stoned with some co-workers and then driving pies to customers.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.27"> &quot;Have you ever been pulled over for driving impaired?&quot; Frank asks.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.28"> &quot;Nope, never,&quot; I reply.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.29"> &quot;Have you ever had an auto accident that was caused where anyone was hurt?&quot; No, I say&#x2014;but I do mention the telephone pole I backed into one night. He moves on to more fertile territory. On my questionnaire, I wrote that I had &quot;supplied&quot; pot to friends. Frank smells blood.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2a"> &quot;I want to go into the verb <em>supplied</em>,&quot; he says. &quot;What did that entail?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2b"> &quot;Letting friends use it,&quot; I say.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2c"> &quot;How much were you purchasing and distributing?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2d"> &quot;Not much.&quot; I explain that I never actually purchased the pot myself but would pay back a friend who bought it for me.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2e"> &quot;How much were you spending, say, a month?&quot; Frank asks.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2f"> &quot;Not more than fifty bucks,&quot; I reply, explaining that I didn&apos;t need to spend more because I could usually just smoke my friends&apos;. I have no troublesome history of dealing weed&#x2014;just mooching it. Based on Frank&apos;s bemused expression, I gather this is not a fatal character flaw, at least for a potential veep.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2g"> Next he zeroes in on a woman my wife and I had hired a couple of years ago to clean our apartment occasionally.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2h"> &quot;Was she an American citizen?&quot; Frank wants to know.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2i"> &quot;I never asked,&quot; I tell him, though I note that she spoke English with a Portuguese accent.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2j"> &quot;Did she have a green card?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2k"> &quot;I never looked. I never inquired.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2l"> Frank asks the same questions about a babysitter who would occasionally pick up our son at preschool when my wife and I were busy at work. She spoke unaccented English, but when Frank asks if we gave her a 1099 tax form, I admit that we didn&apos;t.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2m"> &quot;Did you pay her more than $600 a year?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2n"> Yes, I think we did. Frank&apos;s eyebrows arch.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2o"> &quot;So, potentially, a few tax problems,&quot; he says, scribbling on his sheet of paper.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2p"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558307a33655c24c6c9573b1/master/w_806/news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-bobby-jindal.jpg" alt="news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-bobby-jindal.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmitt-romney-vice-president-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-bobby-jindal.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmitt-romney-vice-president-gq-july-2012&amp;t=news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-bobby-jindal.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmitt-romney-vice-president-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558307a33655c24c6c9573b1%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-bobby-jindal.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-bobby-jindal.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fmitt-romney-vice-president-gq-july-2012&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558307a33655c24c6c9573b1%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fnews-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-bobby-jindal.jpg&amp;description=news-and-politics-2012-08-veep-vetting-bobby-jindal.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2q">  Louisiana governor (and Indian-American political trailblazer) Bobby Jindal  </p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2r"> On issue after issue, Frank digs and quickly hits bedrock. He doesn&apos;t just want to know whether I was bar mitzvahed but also whether we had a bris for our son. Yes to both. He turns up a particularly tasteless haiku I&apos;d written for my college humor magazine&#x2014;&quot;the blood stained carpet / reeks of brains and gun powder / smells like teen spirit&quot; (sorry)&#x2014;and wonders if there are more. There aren&apos;t. He even gets into what I&apos;ve dressed up as for Halloween: &quot;Are there photos of you, or can anybody testify about or make claims about you doing something offensive, dressing up as a Nazi or something racist or sexist?&quot; Nope.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2s"> Finally, Frank gets to the question Bayh had warned me about: &quot;Is there anything I haven&apos;t asked you that might come out in Gawker or Daily Kos or some horrible right-wing blog?&quot; I decide to confess the big family secret: that my octogenarian grandfather was once a bookie connected to the Philadelphia mob and was convicted of illegal gambling activity. (His sentence: probation, plus he had to have a party telephone line in his house for a number of years.) Even this, to my surprise, doesn&apos;t faze Frank. Too long ago. He tells me that he&apos;ll hire an investigator to interview my friends, enemies, even an ex-girlfriend, to look into a few of the potential problems the vet has raised. But he appears convinced that there&apos;s no deep dark secret&#x2014;much less a sex tape&#x2014;to be found. Of course, that doesn&apos;t necessarily make me fit to fill Spiro Agnew&apos;s shoes.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2t">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2u"> &quot;The problem with these vetting processes,&quot; Bob Shrum had told me, &quot;is that you&apos;re always vetting for the last problem.&quot; After Eagleton, for instance, everyone was on the lookout for medical anomalies; after Dan Quayle, vetters fixated on draft records. But a good vetter doesn&apos;t just take cues from the past; he anticipates fresh dangers.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2v"> Frank tells me that if he were vetting veep prospects for Mitt Romney, he knows exactly where he&apos;d dig carefully: mortgages. &quot;Someone could get tripped up by a liar loan,&quot; he says, referring to mortgages in which the borrower overstates his or her income. Given how prevalent the practice was during the housing bubble, Frank thinks it&apos;s possible that somebody on Romney&apos;s list did it, especially if he hails from a state where the bubble was especially outrageous. (Like, say, Florida or Nevada.)</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2w"> Similarly, Frank says he&apos;d spend a lot of time on a potential Romney veep&apos;s religious beliefs&#x2014;and not just their current ones. Has the candidate always been an evangelical (John Thune) or a Catholic (Chris Christie)? Or has his path been circuitous, like that of Marco Rubio, who spent his childhood as a Mormon before converting to, and sticking with, Catholicism? Spiritual questing could be a problem, Frank explains, &quot;because there&apos;s going to be skepticism about Romney&apos;s religion, and you don&apos;t want skepticism about both halves of the ticket.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2x"> Peering even farther into the future, Frank wonders about the types of questions that will be asked of the potential veeps in 2020 and beyond&#x2014;people who are now in their twenties and thirties. &quot;Right now the politicians we&apos;re dealing with are largely people who married their high school or college sweetheart,&quot; he says. &quot;They don&apos;t have a history of being single in their twenties.&quot; The next generation of politicians probably will, which means vetters will want to know more about their sex lives as single adults. &quot;Are there whips? Are there chains? To what extent do people kiss and tell?&quot; Frank wonders. &quot;We&apos;re learning with the David Maraniss book, here&apos;s Obama&apos;s ex-girlfriend turning over her diaries. And here&apos;s one of Christine O&apos;Donnell&apos;s former hookups going to Gawker. I think future vetters are going to have to think about this.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2y"> And what about me? Am I vice presidential material? When we meet for the final time, Frank tells me that his investigator didn&apos;t turn up much. Even one of my es had mostly nice things to say about me. A college pal told the investigator something I&apos;d forgotten&#x2014;that I&apos;d named my bong after my grandfather&#x2014;but Frank doesn&apos;t care about that. What <em>does</em> he care about? Well... My tax returns showed that I&apos;ve made very few charitable contributions. (&quot;There&apos;d be a one-day story about how you don&apos;t give much.&quot;) My financial records revealed that I have way too much money in my checking account. (&quot;Someone&apos;s going to say, &apos;Oh, he doesn&apos;t know how to manage his money. How can somebody who clearly knows so little be put in charge of our economy?&apos; &quot;) My medical history disclosed that ten years ago I had testicular cancer. (&quot;People understand that.&quot;) My college drug use. (&quot;Ideally, you&apos;re a politician already and somebody&apos;s asked you six years ago, and you said, &apos;Oh yeah, I used in college and I stopped after.&apos; &quot;) My grandfather. (The bookmaking, not the bong I named after him. &quot;It comes up as an interesting story, but it doesn&apos;t get used against you. We have somebody research that and then feed it to a journalist: &apos;Hey, here&apos;s an interesting slice of Americana.&apos; &quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.2z"> &quot;Skipping over the fact that you have no experience and we don&apos;t know where you stand on any issues,&quot; Frank says, it turns out my biggest problems are two that hadn&apos;t even crossed my mind: the tas we haven&apos;t paid on babysitters, and the housecleaner who might&apos;ve been here illegally. Frank sums up the report he&apos;d give to the guy at the top of the ticket. &quot;We would say, &apos;He&apos;s got the domestic-help issue, and that has torpedoed candidacies in the past. You&apos;re going to have to make a judgment call, Governor, whether you want Jason Zengerle enough to weather that storm.&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.30"> The real problem with Jason Zengerle, though, is one that Frank is too polite to say to me: I&apos;m too boring&#x2014;even for Mitt Romney. I&apos;m Tim Pawlenty without the truck-driver father. I&apos;m John Thune minus the tan. I&apos;m Rob Portman without Ohio&apos;s eighteen electoral votes. There&apos;s no getting around what I am, and in modern politics, it&apos;s a killer: low risk, low reward.</p><p data-reactid=".6zs1ka2ku8.1.1.0.0.4.31"> <em>Jason Zengerle is a </em>GQ<em>
