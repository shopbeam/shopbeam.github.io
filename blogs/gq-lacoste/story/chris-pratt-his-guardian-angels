  	    "articleBody": "During the reporting of the GQ\u0027s June cover story, Chris Pratt revealed a number of surprising things about his life. One was his quite sincere belief that he has—and has always had—a guardian angel.\u000A\u000AWe are at a Los Angeles burger place next to the car wash where Chris Pratt has just dropped off his wife\u0027s car when he begins to explain to me about his guardian angel. He is telling me about one of his earliest memories: noticing the odd floaty shapes that sometimes appear at the edge of one\u0027s field of vision. Although in his particular case, not just noticing them but deciding that he knew what they were.\u000A\u000A\u0022I remember thinking,\u0022 he says, \u0022 \u0027Oh, those are angels.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not clear to him, even now, why he should have had such a thought. He had been baptized (his mother was Lutheran, his father Catholic) but the environment of his youth was not a particularly religious one. \u0022Church was not a huge part of our upbringing,\u0022 he says. \u0022My parents were more party animals than anything. Laughing. Having a lot of fun. My dad was super strict but it wasn\u0027t like a religious type of strict.\u0022\u000A\u000ANo matter. Their little boy was convinced he could see angels, and the 35-year-old movie star he grew into still doesn\u0027t seem to doubt it.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s always struck me as strange,\u0022 he says, \u0022because I\u0027ve also felt like I\u0027ve had guardian angels through the course of my life.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen I ask what he means, he tells me about a time when he was 6 or 7. The Pratt family lived in an apartment complex, and the school he had to get to was on the other side of a very busy and dangerous road.\u000A\u000A\u0022I was running late for baseball practice or something,\u0022 he recounts, \u0022and I ran across the road without looking because I knew that God wouldn\u0027t let me die. And cars came to a screeching halt and came really close, but I never for a second was concerned or worried. I was, like, \u0027No way.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ADo you think you were right?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. I do think I was right. God wasn\u0027t gonna let me die at that moment.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen else have you felt there was a guardian angel?\u000A\u000A\u0022Meeting my wife. I felt like it was a lot of divine intervention in my life. Meeting Rae Dawn [Chong, the improbable chance encounter with the actress-turned-director that led to his first movie role] and becoming an actor. Just some of the things in my life that have led me toward feeling that I was favored or something. Like there was a plan for me that I\u0027ve been living. You know what I mean?\u0022\u000A\u000ADo you still feel now that you have a guardian angel?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. Yeah. I do. Yeah.\u0022\u000A\u000AHow does it manifest itself?\u000A\u000A\u0022Just seeing certain signs in the world around.\u0022 He winces. \u0022I\u0027m gonna sound like a fucking nut job.\u0022\u000A\u000AAs he says this, a waiter comes with our burgers. \u0022There\u0027s an example right there,\u0022 he says. \u0022I probably should just stop talking. That guy came and cut us off just at the right moment.\u0022\u000A\u000ANaturally, I continue nonetheless.\u000A\u000ADo you picture an actual entity?\u000A\u000A\u0022No, it\u0027s not like it\u0027s like a person who was assigned to me like in a movie or something. But I feel a force—\u0022\u000A\u000AAs he says this, a waitress comes to check on us.\u000A\u000A\u0022See?\u0022 he says, delighted. \u0022Thank you!\u0022 he tells her. She looks confused. \u0022He\u0027s asking me questions that I shouldn\u0027t answer,\u0022 Pratt explains to the waitress, \u0022and every time I\u0027m about to answer someone comes up and interrupts me. And the question is about guardian angels, so today you are just another guardian angel in my life.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Okay, all right! I\u0027ll take it!\u0022 says the waitress, bewildered but clearly enjoying being told that she\u0027s a movie star\u0027s guardian angel.\u000A\u000AWhen she leaves the table, I ask him more.\u000A\u000ADo you mentally or verbally communicate with whatever you think this is?\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah. I pray. I\u0027m a prayer guy.\u0022\u000A\u000ARegularly, or just whenever there\u0027s a need?\u000A\u000A\u0022Regularly. Usually, I try to do it every night before bed, I do it with my son every night before he goes to bed. Kind of just follow the general set of rules that I don\u0027t ask for anything, I just list off things for which I\u0027m grateful. But I ask for other people, people in need. I believe in the power of prayer, I do. I think it\u0027s very, very powerful.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe explains that his sense of a connection to God, and this belief in prayer, was strongly reaffirmed after his son, Jack, was born nine weeks premature.\u000A\u000A\u0022We had received some news about Jack that was not looking good,\u0022 he says. \u0022The doctor kind of sat us down and said, \u0027You need to understand this thing going on with your boy.\u0027 Without going into all the details, basically it was looking really not good in terms of, like, his prognosis for being the great boy that he\u0027s become. She showed us a scan, and on the scan there was this...basically when the cerebellum of the brain swells and it kills the brain tissue around it, and then it stops being swollen, there\u0027s all this black on the scan. Visual evidence that this tissue was dead. She was: \u0027That tissue doesn\u0027t grow back. The severity of it will be determined over time, but just understand this is what you need to be concerned with. This is the reality.\u0027 \u0022 Pratt shared this difficult news with a Navy SEAL friend, who got everyone in his family church in Victoria, Texas, to pray for Jack. \u0022Fifteen hundred or seventeen hundred people prayed for him,\u0022 says Pratt.\u000A\u000AThe next time they tried to look at the damaged area on a scan, it had disappeared. \u0022The doctor, I remember telling me, like, \u0027This doesn\u0027t happen,\u0027 \u0022 says Pratt.\u000A\u000AFor him, that hit home.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m like anybody else,\u0022 he says. \u0022I\u0027m selfish, I\u0027m self-centered and self-involved, and I like to have fun, and I like to do bad things. And then I get reminded. Sort of in moments like that, things change for me. You know, it\u0027s embarrassing to be overly Christian or overly religious in the media. Because I think people can be really judgmental of it. And I\u0027ve been in the business for a long time of being pretty concerned with what people think of me. It was in that moment that I was like: I can\u0027t get too caught up on if someone doesn\u0027t understand this or thinks that I\u0027m simple or thinks ill of me because I feel this way, because I believe in this, and because I think I witnessed a miracle.\u0022",

data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.0"><em>During the reporting of the GQ&#x2019;s June <a href="../entertainment/celebrities/201506/chris-pratt-cover-story">cover story</a>, Chris Pratt revealed a number of surprising things about his life. One was his quite sincere belief that he has&#x2014;and has always had&#x2014;a guardian angel.</em></p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.1">We are at a Los Angeles burger place next to the car wash where Chris Pratt has just dropped off his wife&#x2019;s car when he begins to explain to me about his guardian angel. He is telling me about one of his earliest memories: noticing the odd floaty shapes that sometimes appear at the edge of one&#x2019;s field of vision. Although in his particular case, not just noticing them but deciding that he knew what they were.</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.2">&quot;I remember thinking,&quot; he says, &quot; &#x2019;Oh, those are angels.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.3">It&#x2019;s not clear to him, even now, why he should have had such a thought. He had been baptized (his mother was Lutheran, his father Catholic) but the environment of his youth was not a particularly religious one. &quot;Church was not a huge part of our upbringing,&quot; he says. &quot;My parents were more party animals than anything. Laughing. Having a lot of fun. My dad was super strict but it wasn&#x2019;t like a religious type of strict.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.5">No matter. Their little boy was convinced he could see angels, and the 35-year-old movie star he grew into still doesn&#x2019;t seem to doubt it.</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.6">&quot;It&#x2019;s always struck me as strange,&quot; he says, &quot;because I&#x2019;ve also felt like I&#x2019;ve had guardian angels through the course of my life.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.7">When I ask what he means, he tells me about a time when he was 6 or 7. The Pratt family lived in an apartment complex, and the school he had to get to was on the other side of a very busy and dangerous road.</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.8">&quot;I was running late for baseball practice or something,&quot; he recounts, &quot;and I ran across the road without looking because I knew that God wouldn&#x2019;t let me die. And cars came to a screeching halt and came really close, but I never for a second was concerned or worried. I was, like, &#x2019;No way.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.9"><em>Do you think you were right?</em></p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.a">&quot;Yeah. I do think I was right. God wasn&#x2019;t gonna let me die at that moment.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.b"><em>When else have you felt there was a guardian angel?</em></p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.c">&quot;Meeting my wife. I felt like it was a lot of divine intervention in my life. Meeting Rae Dawn [Chong, the improbable chance encounter with the actress-turned-director that led to his first movie role] and becoming an actor. Just some of the things in my life that have led me toward feeling that I was favored or something. Like there was a plan for me that I&#x2019;ve been living. You know what I mean?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.d"><em>Do you still feel now that you have a guardian angel?</em></p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.e">&quot;Yeah. Yeah. I do. Yeah.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.f"><em>How does it manifest itself?</em></p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.g">&quot;Just seeing certain signs in the world around.&quot; He winces. &quot;I&#x2019;m gonna sound like a fucking nut job.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.h">As he says this, a waiter comes with our burgers. &quot;There&#x2019;s an example right there,&quot; he says. &quot;I probably should just stop talking. That guy came and cut us off just at the right moment.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.i">Naturally, I continue nonetheless.</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.j"><em>Do you picture an actual entity?</em></p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.k">&quot;No, it&#x2019;s not like it&#x2019;s like a person who was assigned to me like in a movie or something. But I feel a force&#x2014;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.l">As he says this, a waitress comes to check on us.</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.m">&quot;See?&quot; he says, delighted. &quot;Thank you!&quot; he tells her. She looks confused. &quot;He&#x2019;s asking me questions that I shouldn&#x2019;t answer,&quot; Pratt explains to the waitress, &quot;and every time I&#x2019;m about to answer someone comes up and interrupts me. And the question is about guardian angels, so today you are just another guardian angel in my life.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.n">&quot;Okay, all right! I&#x2019;ll take it!&quot; says the waitress, bewildered but clearly enjoying being told that she&#x2019;s a movie star&#x2019;s guardian angel.</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.o">When she leaves the table, I ask him more.</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.p"><em>Do you mentally or verbally communicate with whatever you think this is?</em></p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.q">&quot;Yeah. I pray. I&#x2019;m a prayer guy.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.r"><em>Regularly, or just whenever there&#x2019;s a need?</em></p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.s">&quot;Regularly. Usually, I try to do it every night before bed, I do it with my son every night before he goes to bed. Kind of just follow the general set of rules that I don&#x2019;t ask for anything, I just list off things for which I&#x2019;m grateful. But I ask for other people, people in need. I believe in the power of prayer, I do. I think it&#x2019;s very, very powerful.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.t">He explains that his sense of a connection to God, and this belief in prayer, was strongly reaffirmed after his son, Jack, was born nine weeks premature.</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.u">&quot;We had received some news about Jack that was not looking good,&quot; he says. &quot;The doctor kind of sat us down and said, &#x2019;You need to understand this thing going on with your boy.&#x2019; Without going into all the details, basically it was looking really not good in terms of, like, his prognosis for being the great boy that he&#x2019;s become. She showed us a scan, and on the scan there was this...basically when the cerebellum of the brain swells and it kills the brain tissue around it, and then it stops being swollen, there&#x2019;s all this black on the scan. Visual evidence that this tissue was dead. She was: &#x2019;That tissue doesn&#x2019;t grow back. The severity of it will be determined over time, but just understand this is what you need to be concerned with. This is the reality.&#x2019; &quot; Pratt shared this difficult news with a Navy SEAL friend, who got everyone in his family church in Victoria, Texas, to pray for Jack. &quot;Fifteen hundred or seventeen hundred people prayed for him,&quot; says Pratt.</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.v">The next time they tried to look at the damaged area on a scan, it had disappeared. &quot;The doctor, I remember telling me, like, &#x2019;This doesn&#x2019;t happen,&#x2019; &quot; says Pratt.</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.w">For him, that hit home.</p><p data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.4.x">&quot;I&#x2019;m like anybody else,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#x2019;m selfish, I&#x2019;m self-centered and self-involved, and I like to have fun, and I like to do bad things. And then I get reminded. Sort of in moments like that, things change for me. You know, it&#x2019;s embarrassing to be overly Christian or overly religious in the media. Because I think people can be really judgmental of it. And I&#x2019;ve been in the business for a long time of being pretty concerned with what people think of me. It was in that moment that I was like: I can&#x2019;t get too caught up on if someone doesn&#x2019;t understand this or thinks that I&#x2019;m simple or thinks ill of me because I feel this way, because I believe in this, and because I think I witnessed a miracle.&quot;</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".191oyzedjwg.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
