  	    "articleBody": "To whatever extent we think about Star Wars style at all, most of us think of costumes. Not dressing to the nines, but dressing up for Plan 9*—a pastime that\u0027s a whole lot more permissible for adults nowadays than it was back when Trekkies were boomerland\u0027s version of the Amish, but nonetheless nobody\u0027s idea of daywear.\u000A\u000AKids may love the cantina scene to death, but grown-up men and the designers who keep us looking spruce don\u0027t check out that galaxy far away for fashion cues, do they?\u000A\u000AWrong you are, young Skywalker. From parkas meant to rebuke planet Hoth\u0027s eternal winter to flap-pocket jackets suitable for a Rebel Alliance pilot, the Star Wars look is more with us than ever. Case in point, the Smithsonian\u0027s—yes, the Smithsonian\u0027s—traveling exhibition Rebel, Jedi, Princess, Queen: Star Wars and the Power of Costume, which opened in Seattle last January and is due to hit a clutch of other cities between now and 2020.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestIt\u0027s The Millennium Falcon of JacketsHan Solo was a wisecracking hotshot pilot—and he imbued this military number with some sex appeal. Now the same jacket is having a moment here in the Milky Way.© Corbis.  All Rights Reserved.\u000A\u000AIf Alexander Wang\u0027s sportswear is all about winning Luke Skywalker over to the Dark Side, Rick Owens sometimes seems to have dedicated himself to turning Han Solo into an Ewok—unless it\u0027s the other way around.\u000A\u000AMore telltale proof never stops turning up on fashion runways worldwide. Those mod haircuts, that blunt black-white-and-gunmetal-gray palette interrupted by outbreaks of reassuringly Sears-friendly beige and scorched-earth desert storms, that uncanny combination of gnarly resourcefulness and children\u0027s-book simplicity—c\u0027mon, George Lucas should sue. Most movies with comparable fashion legacies primarily influence women\u0027s fashions, but the Princess Leia look has never been in much demand. This one\u0027s all about the guys.\u000A\u000AIf Alexander Wang\u0027s sportswear is all about winning Luke Skywalker over to the Dark Side, Rick Owens sometimes seems to have dedicated himself to turning Han Solo into an Ewok—unless it\u0027s the other way around. As for born-again fashion maven Kanye West, well…Boba Fett sure casts a long shadow, doesn\u0027t he? Almost forty years after the summer a movie we hadn\u0027t yet learned to obediently call Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope first wowed multiplexers fed up with downbeat 1970s murk, the film\u0027s backward-looking idea of tomorrow looks the opposite of dated.\u000A\u000ASo let\u0027s hand it to the Academy for a totally uncharacteristic piece of prescience. An also-ran in the major Oscar categories for which it earned nominations—Best Picture, Directing, and Original Screenplay, along with a Supporting Actor nod to Sir Alec Guinness—Star Wars predictably swept the technical categories for 1977. Not too surprisingly, John Williams, who was competing against his own score for Close Encounters of the Third Kind that year, took home the third of his career-total five Oscars for the DAT-duh-dut-dah theme music. As Dark Knight fans well know, this kind of segregated acknowledgement was (and is) typical of how Hollywood honors box-office megabucks without quite calling the results art.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest© Corbis.  All Rights Reserved.\u000A\u000ABut somewhat less expected was this unabashed popcorn flick\u0027s well-deserved gold statuette for Art Direction. Most unorthodox of all was Star Wars\u0027 win for Costume Design, since that\u0027s a prize Academy voters more often hand out to stultifyingly distinguished-looking period pictures. (If you care, Julia\u0027s 1930s haute couture and A Little Night Music\u0027s late-Victorian folderol were the obvious picks. Just try to imagine how steamed their wardrobe mavens felt at losing out to a bunch of space rubes battling KitchenAid appliances.)\u000A\u000AWhat the Academy got right is that design and music are the primary ways the original Star Wars communicates what the heck it\u0027s all about. Sure, the movie\u0027s dialogue often sounds as if Lucas had set himself the task of creating the planet\u0027s first-ever G-rated porn flick. No question, the plot is so primitive that even Mickey Spillane would have wanted to toss in a corkscrew or two. What Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and even Guinness do has the same relationship to interesting acting that Crayola does to a Rembrandt.\u000A\u000ABut man, did Papa George know how he wanted everything (and everyone) to look. That\u0027s why Star Wars may\u0027ve been the first major production since Charlie Chaplin\u0027s heyday to make as much sense in Djibouti as it did in Des Moines. Grumpy old cine-heads—and there are plenty of them, peering suspiciously out at this silly world from inside forts built out of Robert Altman DVDs—may blame Lucas for infantilizing movies. They don\u0027t give him enough credit for bringing back the universal (i.e., nonverbal) language that film was in its silent days.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestDress For Blizzards The Jedi WayAs Luke knows all too well, the absolute warmest protection from sub-zero temps is found in the belly of a dead Tauntaun. Barring that, we recommend a fur-trimmed parka.© Corbis.  All Rights Reserved.\u000A\u000ACostume designer John Mollo, who also did The Empire Strikes Back, has said his marching orders from the director were simple: \u0022Audiences mustn\u0027t consciously notice the costumes.\u0022 Yet that was just another way of saying that everybody\u0027s outfits, cartoon-style, should telegraph their personality and outlook so directly that behavior and appearance would be one and the same thing. Even Darth Vader\u0027s carapace, which obviously does draw our attention, plays by that rule.\u000A\u000ABasically, they all look like their names, and who among us doesn\u0027t daydream of that? (Proving that Lucas\u0027s crowd-pleasing genius and his mile-wide clumsy streak are inseparable, those cut-to-the-chase monikers are exactly what a more \u0022sophisticated\u0022 filmmaker would shun.) Besides the way the snowy white of Luke\u0027s karate-novice outfit links him to Leia long before we know they\u0027re siblings, his Jedi tunic tells us early on that he\u0027s not only a pure-hearted innocent but, crucially, a pupil. When he graduates to tougher getups—above all, that begoggled, rugged sleeveless-parka look on Empire\u0027s planet Hoth—we\u0027re growing up along with him.\u000A\u000AIf Han Solo\u0027s basic space-cowboy look doesn\u0027t evolve nearly as much, that\u0027s because it\u0027s got no good reason to. The first time we meet him, he\u0027s already Han Solo, and the key to his appearance (like so much of Star Wars\u0027 iconic imagery) is that he represents a child\u0027s idea of virility. It\u0027s an archetype that zaps right into our brains without any interference from our conscious minds.\u000A\u000ABy and large, everybody\u0027s signature outfits aren\u0027t wardrobes so much as individual uniforms—the same contradiction in terms designers never stop striving for. Because Star Wars is a fairy tale, as opposed to the kind of sci-fi that fetishizes fake verisimilitude, Mollo\u0027s idea of credible costumes was more freewheeling than, say, Stanley Kubrick\u0027s in 2001: A Space Odyssey. But he succeeded by never forgetting that he was designing activewear. However fanciful everybody\u0027s occupations may be, their clothes are purposeful and job-oriented, not aimlessly decorative. It\u0027s all too typical of the second trilogy\u0027s loss of clarity that its costumes, along with everything else, look silly by comparison.\u000A\u000ASince most men\u0027s fashion was still hung up on tinkering with the classic business suit—remember, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren were just hitting their stride at the time—the original\u0027s transformative effect on our notions of style shouldn\u0027t be underestimated. We may still aspire to be James Bond when it\u0027s tux time, but half the joggers in Central Park hope they look like Luke Skywalker; the Force is (huff, puff) with them. The same goes for all of us who can hardly go out for milk without gearing up as if we\u0027re hitting a 7-Eleven on planet Alderaan, and where Nike and Adidas would be without Star Wars is anyone\u0027s guess.\u000A\u000AThe movie\u0027s sartorial impact derives from its very American fusion of mythic garb with casual, everyday clothes. Just as Lucas wanted, though, the movie\u0027s costumes can\u0027t be separated from the rest of its effect, which ultimately was and is psychological. He grasped back in 1977 that we craved old-fashioned heroes—virtuous knights, western gunslingers—but could only buy them in fantasy settings. Yet ignoring distinctions between fantasy and reality is pretty much fashion\u0027s reason for being, and ever since Ronald Reagan became our first Luke Skywalker president, it\u0027s increasingly been America\u0027s as well. Is it any wonder that Star Wars\u0027 look has never gone out of style? For better or worse, the Gospel of Papa George never has, either.",

As for born-again fashion maven Kanye West, well&#x2026;Boba Fett sure casts a long shadow, doesn&#x2019;t he? Almost forty years after the summer a movie we hadn&#x2019;t yet learned to obediently call <em>Star Wars: Episode IV&#x2014;A New Hope</em> first wowed multiplexers fed up with downbeat 1970s murk, the film&#x2019;s backward-looking idea of tomorrow looks the opposite of dated.</p><p data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.4.8">So let&#x2019;s hand it to the Academy for a totally uncharacteristic piece of prescience. An also-ran in the major Oscar categories for which it earned nominations&#x2014;Best Picture, Directing, and Original Screenplay, along with a Supporting Actor nod to Sir Alec Guinness&#x2014;<em>Star Wars</em> predictably swept the technical categories for 1977. Not too surprisingly, John Williams, who was competing against his own score for <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> that year, took home the third of his career-total five Oscars for the <em>DAT-duh-dut-dah</em> theme music. As <em>Dark Knight</em> fans well know, this kind of segregated acknowledgement was (and is) typical of how Hollywood honors box-office megabucks without quite calling the results art.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.4.9"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/56045206f0075b5033a1394b/master/w_806/Star-Wars-03.jpg" alt="Star-Wars-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstar-wars-style-inspiration&amp;t=Star-Wars-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstar-wars-style-inspiration&amp;t=Star-Wars-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstar-wars-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F56045206f0075b5033a1394b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FStar-Wars-03.jpg&amp;description=Star-Wars-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstar-wars-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F56045206f0075b5033a1394b%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FStar-Wars-03.jpg&amp;description=Star-Wars-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">&#xA9; Corbis.

Most unorthodox of all was <em>Star Wars&#x2019;</em> win for Costume Design, since that&#x2019;s a prize Academy voters more often hand out to stultifyingly distinguished-looking period pictures. (If you care, <em>Julia&#x2019;</em>s 1930s haute couture and <em>A Little Night Music&#x2019;</em>s late-Victorian folderol were the obvious picks. Just try to imagine how steamed their wardrobe mavens felt at losing out to a bunch of space rubes battling KitchenAid appliances.)</p><p data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.4.b">What the Academy got right is that design and music are the primary ways the original <em>Star Wars</em> communicates what the heck it&#x2019;s all about. Sure, the movie&#x2019;s dialogue often sounds as if Lucas had set himself the task of creating the planet&#x2019;s first-ever G-rated porn flick. No question, the plot is so primitive that even Mickey Spillane would have wanted to toss in a corkscrew or two. What Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and even Guinness do has the same relationship to interesting acting that Crayola does to a Rembrandt.</p><p data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.4.c">But man, did Papa George know how he wanted everything (and everyone) to look. That&#x2019;s why <em>Star Wars</em> may&#x2019;ve been the first major production since Charlie Chaplin&#x2019;s heyday to make as much sense in Djibouti as it did in Des Moines. Grumpy old cine-heads&#x2014;and there are plenty of them, peering suspiciously out at this silly world from inside forts built out of Robert Altman DVDs&#x2014;may blame Lucas for infantilizing movies. They don&#x2019;t give him enough credit for bringing back the universal (i.e., nonverbal) language that film was in its silent days.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.4.d"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5604520500a6dc503f9bb4a8/master/w_806/Star-Wars-02.jpg" alt="Star-Wars-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstar-wars-style-inspiration&amp;t=Star-Wars-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstar-wars-style-inspiration&amp;t=Star-Wars-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstar-wars-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5604520500a6dc503f9bb4a8%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FStar-Wars-02.jpg&amp;description=Star-Wars-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fstar-wars-style-inspiration&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5604520500a6dc503f9bb4a8%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FStar-Wars-02.jpg&amp;description=Star-Wars-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p><strong>Dress For Blizzards The Jedi Way</strong><br>As Luke knows all too well, the absolute warmest protection from sub-zero temps is found in the belly of a dead Tauntaun.

All Rights Reserved.</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.4.e">Costume designer John Mollo, who also did <em>The Empire Strikes Back,</em> has said his marching orders from the director were simple: &#x201C;Audiences mustn&#x2019;t consciously notice the costumes.&#x201D; Yet that was just another way of saying that everybody&#x2019;s outfits, cartoon-style, should telegraph their personality and outlook so directly that behavior and appearance would be one and the same thing. Even Darth Vader&#x2019;s carapace, which obviously <em>does</em> draw our attention, plays by that rule.</p><p data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.4.f">Basically, they all look like their names, and who among us doesn&#x2019;t daydream of that? (Proving that Lucas&#x2019;s crowd-pleasing genius and his mile-wide clumsy streak are inseparable, those cut-to-the-chase monikers are exactly what a more &#x201C;sophisticated&#x201D; filmmaker would shun.) Besides the way the snowy white of Luke&#x2019;s karate-novice outfit links him to Leia long before we know they&#x2019;re siblings, his Jedi tunic tells us early on that he&#x2019;s not only a pure-hearted innocent but, crucially, a pupil. When he graduates to tougher getups&#x2014;above all, that begoggled, rugged sleeveless-parka look on <em>Empire&#x2019;</em>s planet Hoth&#x2014;we&#x2019;re growing up along with him.</p><p data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.4.g">If Han Solo&#x2019;s basic space-cowboy look doesn&#x2019;t evolve nearly as much, that&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s got no good reason to. The first time we meet him, he&#x2019;s already Han Solo, and the key to his appearance (like so much of <em>Star Wars&#x2019;</em> iconic imagery) is that he represents a child&#x2019;s idea of virility. It&#x2019;s an archetype that zaps right into our brains without any interference from our conscious minds.</p><p data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.4.h">By and large, everybody&#x2019;s signature outfits aren&#x2019;t wardrobes so much as individual uniforms&#x2014;the same contradiction in terms designers never stop striving for. Because <em>Star Wars</em> is a fairy tale, as opposed to the kind of sci-fi that fetishizes fake verisimilitude, Mollo&#x2019;s idea of credible costumes was more freewheeling than, say, Stanley Kubrick&#x2019;s in <em>2001: A Space Odyssey.</em> But he succeeded by never forgetting that he was designing activewear. However fanciful everybody&#x2019;s occupations may be, their clothes are purposeful and job-oriented, not aimlessly decorative. It&#x2019;s all too typical of the second trilogy&#x2019;s loss of clarity that its costumes, along with everything else, look silly by comparison.</p><p data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.4.i">Since most men&#x2019;s fashion was still hung up on tinkering with the classic business suit&#x2014;remember, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren were just hitting their stride at the time&#x2014;the original&#x2019;s transformative effect on our notions of style shouldn&#x2019;t be underestimated. We may still aspire to be James Bond when it&#x2019;s tux time, but half the joggers in Central Park hope they look like Luke Skywalker; the Force is (huff, puff) with them. The same goes for all of us who can hardly go out for milk without gearing up as if we&#x2019;re hitting a 7-Eleven on planet Alderaan, and where Nike and Adidas would be without <em>Star Wars</em> is anyone&#x2019;s guess.</p><p data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.4.j">The movie&#x2019;s sartorial impact derives from its very American fusion of mythic garb with casual, everyday clothes. Just as Lucas wanted, though, the movie&#x2019;s costumes can&#x2019;t be separated from the rest of its effect, which ultimately was and is psychological. He grasped back in 1977 that we craved old-fashioned heroes&#x2014;virtuous knights, western gunslingers&#x2014;but could only buy them in fantasy settings. Yet ignoring distinctions between fantasy and reality is pretty much fashion&#x2019;s reason for being, and ever since Ronald Reagan became our first Luke Skywalker president, it&#x2019;s increasingly been America&#x2019;s as well. Is it any wonder that <em>Star Wars&#x2019;</em> look has never gone out of style? For better or worse, the Gospel of Papa George never has, either.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1rlizu6vcow.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div
