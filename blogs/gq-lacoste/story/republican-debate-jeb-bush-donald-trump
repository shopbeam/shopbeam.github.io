  	    "articleBody": "Donald Trump may mock Jeb Bush for being \u0022low energy,\u0022 but Bush certainly has stamina. That was one of the biggest takeaways from the second GOP presidential debate. \u000A\u000AWhile the other 10 candidates on the stage seemed to falter if not completely check out by the time the debate went into the second of its three-plus hours—and millions of viewers presumably clicked away from CNN by the minute—Bush actually gained steam as the debate dragged on. Indeed, his best moment of the night came in the debate\u0027s closing minutes. When Jake Tapper asked the candidates to choose their Secret Service code name, most of them were too punch drunk to recognize Tapper\u0027s question for what it was: a silly, softball that would allow them to show a little humor. (To wit, Rand \u0022Justice Never Sleeps\u0022 Paul and Ben \u0022One Nation\u0022 Carson.) Bush was the only one to hit it out of the park. \u0022Ever-Ready,\u0022 he said and then, looking at Trump added, \u0022it\u0027s very high energy, Donald.\u0022 Then, after Trump proffered his hand to Bush for a high-five, Jeb smacked it so hard that The Donald actually winced. Who\u0027s got Low T now? Jeb might as well have taunted.\u000A\u000ABush just has to hope that this and some of his other late-game heroics—like his staunch defense of his brother and his winning admission that, much to his mother\u0027s consternation, he smoked pot as a teenager—were watched by enough people, especially the big Republican donors who were looking for him to show that he did have the mettle to take out Trump and return the GOP to its proper state of affairs. Because if they only watched the first hour-and-a-half of the debate, they would have seen the version of Jeb that has put them in such a panic. \u000A\u000AIn the debate\u0027s opening moments, Bush picked a fight with Trump over the mogul\u0027s unsuccessful efforts to legalize gambling in Florida, arguing that when he was governor he\u0027d rejected Trump\u0027s efforts to buy him off. The facts were on Jeb\u0027s side. But Trump repeatedly interrupted Bush—\u0022Totally false,\u0022 \u0022Wrong\u0022—and the exchange was a draw. Then Bush picked a fight with Trump over Trump\u0027s statement that Bush was soft on illegal immigration because his wife, Columba, is Mexican-American, demanding that Trump apologize to her. Trump refused, and Bush backed down quickly. It wasn\u0027t quite Mike Dukakis rejecting the death penalty for someone who hypothetically raped and murdered his wife, but it was uncomfortably close.\u000A\u000AWorst of all for Jeb, while he was struggling in the debate\u0027s first two hours, a few of his opponents were putting on a clinic. Having clawed her way onto the main stage after participating in the kids\u0027 table debate last month, Carly Fiorina proved she belonged. She deftly handled a question about her disastrous tenure at as Hewlett-Packard\u0027s CEO with a barrage of statistics that, while mostly bullshit, effectively obscured her disastrous tenure. And she delivered a stemwinder of an anti-abortion speech in her attack on Planned Parenthood. While some of the specifics of her foreign policy proposals were a bit off—her promise to call Ali Khamenei on her first day in office to tell him she was tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran would represent the first time a U.S. president has ever called that country\u0027s Supreme Leader—they were sufficiently bellicose and fact-filled to pass the smell test in a Republican presidential primary. \u000A\u000AAnd then there was her moment with Trump. Asked to respond to Trump\u0027s remark to a Rolling Stone reporter that people wouldn\u0027t vote for Fiorina\u0027s \u0022face,\u0022 Fiorina said, \u0022I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.\u0022 When Trump responded that he thought Fiorina had \u0022a beautiful face,\u0022 she just stared daggers at him. \u000ATed Cruz, meanwhile, wouldn\u0027t have dreamed of attacking Trump, but he turned in a surprisingly effective performance. Yes, his straight-to-camera speaking style is canned and grating, but I\u0027m a reporter! For many Republican primary voters, I\u0027d imagine that seeing the Texas Senator look into their living rooms and swear to them that \u0022we\u0027ll kill the terrorists, we\u0027ll repeal Obamacare, and we\u0027ll defend the Constitution\u0022 is a thrilling experience. \u000A\u000AFinally, there was Marco Rubio. Although he refused to directly mix it up with Trump, the Florida Senator flaunted his foreign policy knowledge in such a way that it often made Trump look like a dunce. The contrast was so obvious that even Trump seemed to notice, at one point defending his own ignorance of international affairs by saying of the Obama administration: \u0022Right now, they know a lot and look at what\u0027s happening: The world is blowing up around us.\u0022 Rubio\u0027s strategy has been to sit back and wait for everyone else to self-destruct. He mostly did that in the second debate, but he asserted himself when he needed to and probably turned a lot of heads among Establishment Republicans nervous about Jeb. Except for those Establishment Republicans who managed to watch ‘til the end.\u000A\u000AAs for the night\u0027s biggest losers, Scott Walker is at the top of the list. The Wisconsin Governor started the debate amped up, immediately going after Trump with the obviously rehearsed but still good line that we didn\u0027t need \u0022an apprentice in the White House.\u0022 But then Walker faded into the woodwork, as if he realized that none of his other prepared zingers were appropriate and that he wasn\u0027t smart enough to come up with new ones on the fly. \u000A\u000ABen Carson also struggled. Fading into the woodwork, of course, is part of what works for him, and his gentlemanly demeanor was, once again, a nice contrast with those around him. But Carson was so obviously out of his depth on policy questions—both foreign and domestic—that a little bluster might have been a useful distraction. What\u0027s more, the world-renowned retired neurosurgeon, who in the past has been a much needed voice of reason (especially among Republican presidential contenders) about vaccines, was so polite in rebutting some of Trump\u0027s anti-vaccine madness that you almost couldn\u0027t tell it was a rebuttal.\u000A\u000AAnd then there was John Kasich. Just as he was in the first debate, the Ohio Governor was undoubtedly the favorite Republican of every Democrat watching—refusing to take shots at Hillary Clinton and forcefully (and repeatedly) denouncing his GOP opponents who said they\u0027d tear up the Iranian nuclear deal on their first day as president. But even more than his heterodox positions, Kasich\u0027s biggest problem is that he was honest about who he is: a career politician. In the debate\u0027s opening minutes, each candidate was given a chance to introduce him or herself. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul said he was an eye surgeon. Rubio said he was from Florida. And Cruz said he was a son, a husband, and a father. Kasich was the only candidate onstage who copped to being an elected official. Considering that Trump and Carson are leading the GOP field, and Fiorina looks like she might soon join them in the top tier, that\u0027s the last thing a candidate wants to do in one of these debates.\u000A\u000AJason Zengerle is GQ\u0027s Political Correspondent",

data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.3"></h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4.0">Donald Trump may mock Jeb Bush for being &#x201C;low energy,&#x201D; but Bush certainly has stamina. That was one of the biggest takeaways from the second GOP presidential debate. </p><p data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4.1">While the other 10 candidates on the stage seemed to falter if not completely check out by the time the debate went into the second of its three-plus hours&#x2014;and millions of viewers presumably clicked away from CNN by the minute&#x2014;Bush actually gained steam as the debate dragged on. Indeed, his best moment of the night came in the debate&#x2019;s closing minutes. When Jake Tapper asked the candidates to choose their Secret Service code name, most of them were too punch drunk to recognize Tapper&#x2019;s question for what it was: a silly, softball that would allow them to show a little humor. (To wit, Rand &#x201C;Justice Never Sleeps&#x201D; Paul and Ben &#x201C;One Nation&#x201D; Carson.) Bush was the only one to hit it out of the park. &#x201C;Ever-Ready,&#x201D; he said and then, looking at Trump added, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s very high energy, Donald.&#x201D; Then, after Trump proffered his hand to Bush for a high-five, Jeb smacked it so hard that The Donald <a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/09/17/gop-debate-cnn-8p-25-jeb-bush-donald-trump-high-five.cnn/video/playlists/2016-presidential-debates/">actually winced</a>. <em>Who&#x2019;s got Low T now?</em> Jeb might as well have taunted.</p><p data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4.2">Bush just has to hope that this and some of his other late-game heroics&#x2014;like his staunch defense of his brother and his winning admission that, much to his mother&#x2019;s consternation, he smoked pot as a teenager&#x2014;were watched by enough people, especially the big Republican donors who were looking for him to show that he did have the mettle to take out Trump and return the GOP to its proper state of affairs. Because if they only watched the first hour-and-a-half of the debate, they would have seen the version of Jeb that has put them in such a panic. </p><p data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4.3">In the debate&#x2019;s opening moments, Bush picked a fight with Trump over the mogul&#x2019;s unsuccessful efforts to legalize gambling in Florida, arguing that when he was governor he&#x2019;d rejected Trump&#x2019;s efforts to buy him off. The facts were <a href="http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/sep/16/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-said-donald-trump-wanted-casino-gambling-/">on Jeb&#x2019;s side</a>. But Trump repeatedly interrupted Bush&#x2014;&#x201C;Totally false,&#x201D; &#x201C;Wrong&#x201D;&#x2014;and the exchange was a draw. Then Bush picked a fight with Trump over Trump&#x2019;s statement that Bush was soft on illegal immigration because his wife, Columba, is Mexican-American, demanding that Trump apologize to her. Trump refused, and Bush backed down quickly. It wasn&#x2019;t quite Mike Dukakis rejecting the death penalty for someone who hypothetically raped and murdered his wife, but it was uncomfortably close.</p><p data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4.5">Worst of all for Jeb, while he was struggling in the debate&#x2019;s first two hours, a few of his opponents were putting on a clinic. Having clawed her way onto the main stage after participating in the kids&#x2019; table debate last month, Carly Fiorina proved she belonged. She deftly handled a question about her disastrous tenure at as Hewlett-Packard&#x2019;s CEO with a barrage of statistics that, while mostly bullshit, effectively obscured her disastrous tenure. And she delivered a stemwinder of an anti-abortion speech in her attack on Planned Parenthood. While some of the specifics of her foreign policy proposals were a bit off&#x2014;her promise to call Ali Khamenei on her first day in office to tell him she was tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran would represent the first time a U.S. president has ever called that country&#x2019;s Supreme Leader&#x2014;they were sufficiently bellicose and fact-filled to pass the smell test in a Republican presidential primary. </p><p data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4.6">And then there was her moment with Trump. Asked to respond to Trump&#x2019;s remark to a <em>Rolling Stone</em> reporter that people wouldn&#x2019;t vote for Fiorina&#x2019;s &#x201C;face,&#x201D; Fiorina said, &#x201C;I think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said.&#x201D; When Trump responded that he thought Fiorina had &#x201C;a beautiful face,&#x201D; she just stared daggers at him. 
Ted Cruz, meanwhile, wouldn&#x2019;t have dreamed of attacking Trump, but he turned in a surprisingly effective performance. Yes, his straight-to-camera speaking style is canned and grating, but I&#x2019;m a reporter! For many Republican primary voters, I&#x2019;d imagine that seeing the Texas Senator look into their living rooms and swear to them that &#x201C;we&#x2019;ll kill the terrorists, we&#x2019;ll repeal Obamacare, and we&#x2019;ll defend the Constitution&#x201D; is a thrilling experience. </p><p data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4.7">Finally, there was Marco Rubio. Although he refused to directly mix it up with Trump, the Florida Senator flaunted his foreign policy knowledge in such a way that it often made Trump look like a dunce. The contrast was so obvious that even Trump seemed to notice, at one point defending his own ignorance of international affairs by saying of the Obama administration: &#x201C;Right now, they know a lot and look at what&#x2019;s happening: The world is blowing up around us.&#x201D; Rubio&#x2019;s strategy has been to sit back and wait for everyone else to self-destruct. He mostly did that in the second debate, but he asserted himself when he needed to and probably turned a lot of heads among Establishment Republicans nervous about Jeb. Except for those Establishment Republicans who managed to watch &#x2018;til the end.</p><p data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4.8">As for the night&#x2019;s biggest losers, Scott Walker is at the top of the list. The Wisconsin Governor started the debate amped up, immediately going after Trump with the obviously rehearsed but still good line that we didn&#x2019;t need &#x201C;an apprentice in the White House.&#x201D; But then Walker faded into the woodwork, as if he realized that none of his other prepared zingers were appropriate and that he wasn&#x2019;t smart enough to come up with new ones on the fly. </p><p data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4.9">Ben Carson also struggled. Fading into the woodwork, of course, is part of what works for him, and his gentlemanly demeanor was, once again, a nice contrast with those around him. But Carson was so obviously out of his depth on policy questions&#x2014;both foreign and domestic&#x2014;that a little bluster might have been a useful distraction. What&#x2019;s more, the world-renowned retired neurosurgeon, who in the past has been a much needed voice of reason (especially among Republican presidential contenders) about vaccines, was so polite in rebutting some of Trump&#x2019;s anti-vaccine madness that you almost couldn&#x2019;t tell it was a rebuttal.</p><p data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4.a">And then there was John Kasich. Just as he was in the first debate, the Ohio Governor was undoubtedly the favorite Republican of every Democrat watching&#x2014;refusing to take shots at Hillary Clinton and forcefully (and repeatedly) denouncing his GOP opponents who said they&#x2019;d tear up the Iranian nuclear deal on their first day as president. But even more than his heterodox positions, Kasich&#x2019;s biggest problem is that he was honest about who he is: a career politician. In the debate&#x2019;s opening minutes, each candidate was given a chance to introduce him or herself. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul said he was an eye surgeon. Rubio said he was from Florida. And Cruz said he was a son, a husband, and a father. Kasich was the only candidate onstage who copped to being an elected official. Considering that Trump and Carson are leading the GOP field, and Fiorina looks like she might soon join them in the top tier, that&#x2019;s the last thing a candidate wants to do in one of these debates.</p><p data-reactid=".1vzbaps8feo.1.1.0.0.4.b"><em><strong>Jason Zengerle</strong> is </em>GQ<em>&#x2019;s Political Correspondent</em></p></div><div class="grid"
