  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ALast season, Russell Westbrook made his second All-Star Game, and played a crucial part in getting his Oklahoma City Thunder squad into the NBA Finals. Still, at least in the relentless real time of the internet, praise and criticism seemed to go hand in hand. Westbrook was out of control; he took too many ill-advised shots; he didn\u0027t get the ball his transcendent teammate Kevin Durant often enough.\u000A\u000ABut even as the Thunder caught a Finals loss, Westbrook\u0027s teammates and coaches consistently stood up for him. And when the Thunder had to make a long-term value judgment at the beginning of this season, it was James Harden they sent fishing.\u000A\u000AIt hasn\u0027t received much attention, I suppose because improvement just isn\u0027t as absorbing as frustration, or perhaps because that Durant fellow casts a long shadow, but this season might be Westbrook\u0027s best. While he\u0027s still averaging right around 22 points per game, just like he has the last three seasons, he\u0027s currently dishing a career-high 8.3 assists per game, three more per night than he posted last year. He\u0027s also taking (and making) more threes than ever before, with an effective field goal percentage on threes of over 54 percent. And the more potent his perimeter game becomes, the more defenders have to commit to chasing him off the three-point line, opening avenues for Russ to dash to the rim. As Durant noted on Wednesday night, after Westbrook hung 32 on Denver: \u0022It\u0027s like a nightmare when he\u0027s making that jump shot.\u0022 No kidding: The 31-8 Thunder currently have the best record in the NBA.\u000A\u000AWestbrook\u0027s emergence has not just been on the floor. He made a fashion splash during last season\u0027s playoffs by wearing a colorful Lacoste shirt and red-framed glasses\u000A\u000AWestbrook continued his fashion adventure throughout the postseason and into this season, modeling for a fashion feature in the January issue of GQ. A few months back as we were working on the piece, I spoke to Westbrook about his signature style, both on and off the court.\u000A\u000AGQ: I know you\u0027re from California but did you grow up in Los Angeles?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: I\u0027m from inner city L.A.\u000A\u000AGQ: And were you a Laker fan growing up? Or the Clippers?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: You know what? My dad and my Mom were Lakers fans, but I wasn\u0027t like a die-hard Lakers fan, not really. I was kind of a fan, but not die-hard. I was definitely a basketball fan, but my first sport was football.\u000A\u000AGQ: When was that when the Raiders were in L.A.?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: (laughs) Nah, nah, nah. That was way before my time.\u000A\u000AGQ: Who was your basketball idol growing up?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Magic Johnson was my favorite player growing up.\u000A\u000AGQ: Wasn\u0027t he before your time a little, too?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: He definitely is. But I\u0027ve seen a lot of film. The stuff that he does off the court is intriguing to me. That\u0027s one of the main reasons as well.\u000A\u000AGQ: So when you were growing up, was he already doing the Starbucks and the movie theaters and stuff?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Yeah, exactly. He was doing all that, different foundations, things of that nature.\u000A\u000AGQ: The way you play point guard is pretty unique in the NBA, or at least unique in terms of what historically has been thought of from a point guard. Did you realize that coming up? Did you know you played a style all your own?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Definitely. I was always wilder and fast, and on the floor I always kind of played out of control when I was younger. So I knew I played the position differently than everybody else did. But they didn\u0027t make me feel different about it.\u000A\u000AGQ: Last season you guys get to the Finals and you lose. Your team always seems to learn to learn lessons and apply them. So what do you take from losing in the Finals?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Aw man, it\u0027s tough man. When you make it that far, when you get that close to winning, it\u0027s kind of tough to get ready for the next year. But we took a lot from it. Every play in the Finals is very important, every possession is important. Everybody stepped their game up a notch.\u000A\u000AGQ: What was it like watching your guy Harden go off his first game with the Rockets?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: It was good, man, it was exciting. He definitely can play. He\u0027s going to be a good piece for them.\u000A\u000AGQ: How do you compensate for losing him?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: We have a good team, man. My job is to make sure we continue to win games, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to try to do. I try to keep it going.\u000A\u000AGQ: One thing about the Playoffs that was a lot of fun was your outfits during the press conferences. Did you know you had made it when everyone on the TNT set was wearing your shirt and glasses that night?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: That was pretty funny. I didn\u0027t even know that was happening until after our game, and then everybody kind of told me. But that was interesting.\u000A\u000AGQ: When did you get interested in fashion?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Just growing up. My Mom and I shopped all the time, she shops all the time, and I was always into fashion. I\u0027ve been blessed to be in a situation where I can now buy some of the things that look good.\u000A\u000AGQ: What kind of clothes was your Mom into?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: She would make sure we looked nice. She would make sure we were up to par with the fashion and what was going on. She stays on me now, lets me know what looks right, what looks good. It\u0027s still there.\u000A\u000AGQ: Did you like the stuff she would pick out for you back then?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Definitely. I wouldn\u0027t mind that at all. Because I knew she wasn\u0027t lost or didn\u0027t know what looked good or what was not hip. I didn\u0027t mind that at all.\u000A\u000AGQ: Now as you\u0027ve aged and you can buy your own stuff, what\u0027s interesting to you?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: I look for the different stuff, man. I\u0027m confident in some of the things that I wear, regardless of what other people are wearing. I just try to find what looks good on me. I shop all the time, basically every day, whether it\u0027s online or in every city we go to.\u000A\u000AGQ: Were you like that in high school and college too? Were you concerned with the way you looked then?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: In college I didn\u0027t dress up every day, for class or stuff like that, but when it came time to do certain things I\u0027d dress up for sure.\u000A\u000AGQ: What did you wear to the prom in high school?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: I had an all-white tux with a turquoise vest, and some white-and-turquoise Stacy Adams. I won best dressed at prom.\u000A\u000AGQ: Did you win best dressed in the yearbook?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: No, I didn\u0027t because in high school I didn\u0027t dress up every day. I\u0027d just wear basketball shorts. I could have tried if I wanted to, but I didn\u0027t.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you make an effort to dress up every day now? Or are there still days when you just throw on shorts and sweats.\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: For practice I\u0027ll throw on sweats, but any time I\u0027m going to events I\u0027ll dress up. I mean, I buy so many clothes, I\u0027ve got to wear them somewhere.\u000A\u000AGQ: Which outfit during the Playoffs last year got the most attention?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: It was probably that first one. Honestly, I didn\u0027t even think people would get it. I just thought it was a nice shirt, classic, something I\u0027ve been doing for a while. I just kind of threw on what I had already. I wasn\u0027t trying to make a fashion statement, it just kind of happened that way.\u000A\u000AGQ: That was the Lacoste shirt?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Yeah.\u000A\u000AGQ: But you had to know those red glasses were going to get some attention.\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Well, see, I didn\u0027t. I don\u0027t really pay no mind to it. I kind of just see it, and I get it. If I like it, I\u0027ll wear it regardless of what\u0027s going on or if somebody says something or not.\u000A\u000AGQ: When you wear those glasses, do they have lenses in them or no?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: No, no, nine times out of ten, no. Some of them do, but not most of them, no.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you need glasses?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Nah. I have the best vision.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you have a stylist or talk to a stylist at all?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Nah. I mean, I have different people who can help me get shoes early or whatever, but putting stuff together and buying stuff, I kind of just do it on my own. I choose what looks good and go from there. I take a lot of time and see what looks good.\u000A\u000AGQ: So when you guys are in the road in, say, Chicago, how will you go shopping? Do you go the mall? Do you try to find something different?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: I go to different boutiques. I just walk around, and I know a few places to go. I don\u0027t walk around too much because we\u0027ll have a game, but I might try to go into a store or two and see what I can get.\u000A\u000AGQ: We talked about how the way you play as a point guard is unique. Is it fair to say that the way you dress and the way you play point guard has some connection there? Because they\u0027re both pretty distinctive and different...\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Definitely. For sure. Definitely.\u000A\u000AGQ: Is that something you think about? Or is that just natural?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Nah, I don\u0027t really think about it, it\u0027s just natural. It\u0027s kind of like, I have a certain taste in clothes, and I might be like, \u0022I like this,\u0022 when other people are like, \u0022I can\u0027t wear that.\u0022 And basketball, I might be able to do this at this position, while other guys might not think they can. So it kind of goes hand in hand.\u000A\u000AGQ: Where do you go from here with the fashion stuff? Are you going to start rocking three-piece suits or something?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: I\u0027ve got a lot of things in store. I\u0027m going to try and stay in the same area. There\u0027s a lot of different ways that you can wear printed shirts, as you will see in the GQ shoot. There\u0027s different ways you can style it out.\u000A\u000AGQ: Is one of the best parts about getting to go to the NBA Finals getting to wear more shirts at the press conferences?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: (laughs) I guess, because before I never did the press conferences, they didn\u0027t want me to, then last year they wanted me to do it.\u000A\u000AGQ: Why do you wear number zero?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: My favorite number is 4, but when I got here I wasn\u0027t able to get it, nor in college. So when I got here I picked zero as a new beginning for me, it was a new start. I started from ground zero, a new beginning in my life.\u000A\u000AGQ: On Twitter I see you\u0027ve got this hashtag #whynot. In a way that sounds like how you look at fashion and basketball.\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: That\u0027s the way I live life. It\u0027s kind of something that I\u0027ve been going by for a long time. It relates to anything, man. It relates to school, to kids of any age at all. It\u0027s a good thing and it works.\u000A\u000AGQ: How would you explain it to somebody? What does it mean?\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: For example, if you\u0027re a kid and you want to be a doctor, ask yourself \u0022Why not?\u0022 be a doctor. Why not be a teacher? Why not be an engineer? There\u0027s no reason to hold yourself back and say you can\u0027t do something in life unless you go for it and try to do it. So why not?\u000A\u000AGQ: That\u0027s great. So if I was like, \u0022Tonight I might put on some red-rimmed lenseless glasses to go out...\u0022\u000A\u000A Russell Westbrook: Exactly, why not? All positives man, all positives man. Defintely nothing negatives, all positives.\u000A\u000A_Lang Whitaker is GQ\u0027s NBA blogger as well as the editor-at-large at SLAM Magazine and a regular contributor to NBA TV.

Westbrook made his second All-Star Game, and played a crucial part in getting his Oklahoma City Thunder squad into the NBA Finals. Still, at least in the relentless real time of the internet, praise and criticism seemed to go hand in hand. Westbrook was out of control; he took too many ill-advised shots; he didn&#x2019;t get the ball his transcendent teammate Kevin Durant often enough.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.2">But even as the Thunder caught a Finals loss, Westbrook&#x2019;s teammates and coaches consistently stood up for him. And when the Thunder had to make a long-term value judgment at the beginning of this season, it was James Harden they sent fishing.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.3">It hasn&#x2019;t received much attention, I suppose because improvement just isn&#x2019;t as absorbing as frustration, or perhaps because that Durant fellow casts a long shadow, but this season might be Westbrook&#x2019;s best. While he&#x2019;s still averaging right around 22 points per game, just like he has the last three seasons, he&#x2019;s currently dishing a career-high 8.3 assists per game, three more per night than he posted last year. He&#x2019;s also taking (and making) more threes than ever before, with an effective field goal percentage on threes of over 54 percent. And the more potent his perimeter game becomes, the more defenders have to commit to chasing him off the three-point line, opening avenues for Russ to dash to the rim. As Durant noted on Wednesday night, after Westbrook hung 32 on Denver: &quot;It&#x2019;s like a nightmare when he&#x2019;s making that jump shot.&quot; No kidding: The 31-8 Thunder currently have the best record in the NBA.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.5">Westbrook&#x2019;s emergence has not just been on the floor. He made a fashion splash during last season&#x2019;s playoffs by wearing <a href="http://blogimages.thescore.com/tbj/files/2012/05/russell-westbrook-shirt.jpg) to a postgame presser. (This look prompted noted sartorialist Charles Barkley to say," title="Well, at least we know they&#x2019;ve got a TJ Maxx in Oklahoma City.">a colorful Lacoste shirt and red-framed glasses</a></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.6">Westbrook continued his fashion adventure throughout the postseason and into this season, <a href="../style/profiles/201301/the-fresh-prints-russell-westbrook#slide=1">modeling for a fashion feature in the January issue of GQ</a>. A few months back as we were working on the piece, I spoke to Westbrook about his signature style, both on and off the court.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>GQ: I know you&#x2019;re from California but did you grow up in Los Angeles?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> I&#x2019;m from inner city L.A.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>GQ: And were you a Laker fan growing up? Or the Clippers?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> You know what? My dad and my Mom were Lakers fans, but I wasn&#x2019;t like a die-hard Lakers fan, not really. I was kind of a fan, but not die-hard. I was definitely a basketball fan, but my first sport was football.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>GQ: When was that when the Raiders were in L.A.?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> (laughs) Nah, nah, nah. That was way before my time.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>GQ: Who was your basketball idol growing up?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Magic Johnson was my favorite player growing up.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>GQ: Wasn&#x2019;t he before your time a little, too?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> He definitely is. But I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of film. The stuff that he does off the court is intriguing to me. That&#x2019;s one of the main reasons as well.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>GQ: So when you were growing up, was he already doing the Starbucks and the movie theaters and stuff?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Yeah, exactly. He was doing all that, different foundations, things of that nature.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>GQ: The way you play point guard is pretty unique in the NBA, or at least unique in terms of what historically has been thought of from a point guard. Did you realize that coming up? Did you know you played a style all your own?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Definitely. I was always wilder and fast, and on the floor I always kind of played out of control when I was younger. So I knew I played the position differently than everybody else did. But they didn&#x2019;t make me feel different about it.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>GQ: Last season you guys get to the Finals and you lose. Your team always seems to learn to learn lessons and apply them. So what do you take from losing in the Finals?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Aw man, it&#x2019;s tough man. When you make it that far, when you get that close to winning, it&#x2019;s kind of tough to get ready for the next year. But we took a lot from it. Every play in the Finals is very important, every possession is important. Everybody stepped their game up a notch.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>GQ: What was it like watching your guy Harden go off his first game with the Rockets?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> It was good, man, it was exciting. He definitely can play. He&#x2019;s going to be a good piece for them.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>GQ: How do you compensate for losing him?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> We have a good team, man. My job is to make sure we continue to win games, and that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going to try to do. I try to keep it going.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>GQ: One thing about the Playoffs that was a lot of fun was your outfits during the press conferences. Did you know you had made it when everyone on the TNT set was wearing your shirt and glasses that night?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> That was pretty funny. I didn&#x2019;t even know that was happening until after our game, and then everybody kind of told me. But that was interesting.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>GQ: When did you get interested in fashion?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Just growing up. My Mom and I shopped all the time, she shops all the time, and I was always into fashion. I&#x2019;ve been blessed to be in a situation where I can now buy some of the things that look good.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>GQ: What kind of clothes was your Mom into?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> She would make sure we looked nice. She would make sure we were up to par with the fashion and what was going on. She stays on me now, lets me know what looks right, what looks good. It&#x2019;s still there.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>GQ: Did you like the stuff she would pick out for you back then?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.y"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Definitely. I wouldn&#x2019;t mind that at all. Because I knew she wasn&#x2019;t lost or didn&#x2019;t know what looked good or what was not hip. I didn&#x2019;t mind that at all.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>GQ: Now as you&#x2019;ve aged and you can buy your own stuff, what&#x2019;s interesting to you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> I look for the different stuff, man. I&#x2019;m confident in some of the things that I wear, regardless of what other people are wearing. I just try to find what looks good on me. I shop all the time, basically every day, whether it&#x2019;s online or in every city we go to.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong>GQ: Were you like that in high school and college too? Were you concerned with the way you looked then?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.12"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> In college I didn&#x2019;t dress up every day, for class or stuff like that, but when it came time to do certain things I&#x2019;d dress up for sure.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>GQ: What did you wear to the prom in high school?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.14"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> I had an all-white tux with a turquoise vest, and some white-and-turquoise Stacy Adams. I won best dressed at prom.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>GQ: Did you win best dressed in the yearbook?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.16"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> No, I didn&#x2019;t because in high school I didn&#x2019;t dress up every day. I&#x2019;d just wear basketball shorts. I could have tried if I wanted to, but I didn&#x2019;t.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.17"><strong>GQ: Do you make an effort to dress up every day now? Or are there still days when you just throw on shorts and sweats.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.18"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> For practice I&#x2019;ll throw on sweats, but any time I&#x2019;m going to events I&#x2019;ll dress up. I mean, I buy so many clothes, I&#x2019;ve got to wear them somewhere.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.19"><strong>GQ: Which outfit during the Playoffs last year got the most attention?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1a"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> It was probably that first one. Honestly, I didn&#x2019;t even think people would get it. I just thought it was a nice shirt, classic, something I&#x2019;ve been doing for a while. I just kind of threw on what I had already. I wasn&#x2019;t trying to make a fashion statement, it just kind of happened that way.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><strong>GQ: That was the Lacoste shirt?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Yeah.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><strong>GQ: But you had to know those red glasses were going to get some attention.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Well, see, I didn&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t really pay no mind to it. I kind of just see it, and I get it. If I like it, I&#x2019;ll wear it regardless of what&#x2019;s going on or if somebody says something or not.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><strong>GQ: When you wear those glasses, do they have lenses in them or no?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> No, no, nine times out of ten, no. Some of them do, but not most of them, no.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><strong>GQ: Do you need glasses?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1i"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Nah. I have the best vision.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1j"><strong>GQ: Do you have a stylist or talk to a stylist at all?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1k"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Nah. I mean, I have different people who can help me get shoes early or whatever, but putting stuff together and buying stuff, I kind of just do it on my own. I choose what looks good and go from there. I take a lot of time and see what looks good.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1l"><strong>GQ: So when you guys are in the road in, say, Chicago, how will you go shopping? Do you go the mall? Do you try to find something different?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1m"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> I go to different boutiques. I just walk around, and I know a few places to go. I don&#x2019;t walk around too much because we&#x2019;ll have a game, but I might try to go into a store or two and see what I can get.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1n"><strong>GQ: We talked about how the way you play as a point guard is unique. Is it fair to say that the way you dress and the way you play point guard has some connection there? Because they&#x2019;re both pretty distinctive and different...</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1o"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Definitely. For sure. Definitely.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1p"><strong>GQ: Is that something you think about? Or is that just natural?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1q"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Nah, I don&#x2019;t really think about it, it&#x2019;s just natural. It&#x2019;s kind of like, I have a certain taste in clothes, and I might be like, &quot;I like this,&quot; when other people are like, &quot;I can&#x2019;t wear that.&quot; And basketball, I might be able to do this at this position, while other guys might not think they can. So it kind of goes hand in hand.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1r"><strong>GQ: Where do you go from here with the fashion stuff? Are you going to start rocking three-piece suits or something?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1s"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> I&#x2019;ve got a lot of things in store. I&#x2019;m going to try and stay in the same area. There&#x2019;s a lot of different ways that you can wear printed shirts, as you will see in the GQ shoot. There&#x2019;s different ways you can style it out.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1t"><strong>GQ: Is one of the best parts about getting to go to the NBA Finals getting to wear more shirts at the press conferences?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1u"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> (laughs) I guess, because before I never did the press conferences, they didn&#x2019;t want me to, then last year they wanted me to do it.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1v"><strong>GQ: Why do you wear number zero?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1w"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> My favorite number is 4, but when I got here I wasn&#x2019;t able to get it, nor in college. So when I got here I picked zero as a new beginning for me, it was a new start. I started from ground zero, a new beginning in my life.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1x"><strong>GQ: On Twitter I see you&#x2019;ve got <a href="https://twitter.com/russwest44">this hashtag #whynot</a>.

It&#x2019;s kind of something that I&#x2019;ve been going by for a long time. It relates to anything, man. It relates to school, to kids of any age at all. It&#x2019;s a good thing and it works.</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.1z"><strong>GQ: How would you explain it to somebody? What does it mean?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.20"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> For example, if you&#x2019;re a kid and you want to be a doctor, ask yourself &quot;Why not?&quot; be a doctor. Why not be a teacher? Why not be an engineer? There&#x2019;s no reason to hold yourself back and say you can&#x2019;t do something in life unless you go for it and try to do it. So why not?</p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.21"><strong>GQ: That&#x2019;s great. So if I was like, &quot;Tonight I might put on some red-rimmed lenseless glasses to go out...&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".ib3n9zwcu8.1.1.0.0.4.22"><strong> Russell Westbrook:</strong> Exactly, why not?
