  	    "articleBody": "For all the recent evidence that careers can unspiral pretty quickly in Washington—see the soon-to-retire House Speaker John Boehner or his would-be replacement, Kevin McCarthy—you might consider as the converse the bright and rising star that is Trey Gowdy.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestMost Clinton investigations end up like Representative Trey Gowdy\u0027s hair: unruly and all over the place.\u000A\u000AIt wasn\u0027t so long ago that the third-term Republican congressman from South Carolina was a virtual nonentity on Capitol Hill, a point he concedes himself. \u0022I would not be on the list of what I believe to be the top 20 most effective members of Congress,\u0022 Gowdy told me. To the extent he was known at all, it was for his golf handicap (a 1.7, he says, the lowest in the House) and for his bewildering haircut—an ever-changing coiffure that has rotated between a faux-hawk, a slick-back, and a modiﬁed mullet. And yet, in the last several weeks, Gowdy has been pestered—at times outright begged—by his congressional Republican colleagues to take McCarthy\u0027s place as Majority Leader and Boehner\u0027s as Speaker of the House.  \u000A\u000AAnd on Thursday, the very thing that has made Gowdy one of the most important Republicans in Congress will make him the most important Republican in America. That\u0027s because the hopes and fever dreams of a vast multitude of conservatives will be vested in him that day, when, as chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, he\u0027ll publicly grill Hillary Clinton about her private e-mail server. It\u0027s a long-awaited showdown that\u0027s now suddenly billed as a political Super Bowl, a potentially golden opportunity for both Clinton\u0027s detractors and her defenders.  \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe genesis of Thursday\u0027s spectacle—as well as Gowdy\u0027s newfound notoriety and the whole Benghazi committee—can be traced to a morning last May in the congressman\u0027s backyard. While Gowdy mowed the lawn behind his Spartanburg, South Carolina, home, his phone began to ring, with Boehner on the other end.  \u000A\u000ANearly two years had passed since the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, but Boehner and House Republicans still sniffed opportunity in the conspiracy theories swirling around then Secretary of State Clinton\u0027s response to the assault. Four Americans had died, and conservatives ﬁgured that Clinton had been guilty of, at best, negligence or, at worst, a despicable cover-up. With a presidential campaign on the horizon, they glimpsed a perfect time to create a special committee to dig around on Benghazi and, by extension, Clinton.  \u000A\u000AAnd this is where Gowdy came in: Before he was a ho-hum congressman, he was a spectacular lawyer, a crusading prosecutor with a specialty in long-unsolved murder cases. He\u0027d be the perfect guy to clear up a Libyan cold case—and maybe lend a partisan crusade the sheen of professionalism and objectivity, too.  \u000A\u000AGowdy ﬁnished up the backyard and noticed his missed call. When he rang his boss back, he heard the Speaker\u0027s familiar nicotine baritone: \u0022Thinking about doing this committee thing. Don\u0027t say anything. I\u0027ll call you back later this afternoon.\u0022  \u000A\u000AThe news raised a pressing question for Gowdy—a practical concern that wouldn\u0027t likely occur to anyone in his position. He wanted to know if he had time to ﬁnish mowing his lawn. \u0022How soon will you call back?\u0022 he asked the Speaker. \u0022I\u0027ve still got to cut the front yard.\u0022  \u000A\u000A\u0022Go cut the yard, son,\u0022 Boehner replied.  \u000A\u000AGowdy, who is 51, was told later that afternoon that he\u0027d be chairing the House Select Committee on Benghazi. And in the past 18 months he\u0027s quietly overseen interviews with nearly four dozen witnesses in private sessions (the most recent last Friday, with longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin), for a highly anticipated report the committee hopes to release early next year.  \u000A\u000AOf course, for all the closed-door testimony, the committee\u0027s most important discovery is already notoriously public and plenty damaging to the Clinton campaign. Gowdy\u0027s investigators unearthed eight e-mail messages that contained a private address used by Clinton. This led in March to the realization that she had been using a private server installed in her home. The mystery of why she used the secret server—and the myriad GOP fantasies about what she kept hidden with it—has obviously become a central story line in the early drama of the Clinton campaign.  \u000A\u000AAnd it\u0027s changed the course of Gowdy\u0027s career. If the congressman has become an avenging angel and a rising star to his fellow Republicans, to Democrats Gowdy\u0027s now considered a villainous hatchet man. \u0022Boehner made a decision to launch a partisan investigation, and Gowdy\u0027s carrying that out,\u0022 says David Brock, the author and former right-wing attack dog who has become a staunch Clinton defender.  \u000A\u000AThat\u0027s an argument that gained credibility in recent weeks as the Benghazi committee, after 18 months of seemingly careful work, has suddenly become a circus. In September, McCarthy, the House Majority Leader and then Speaker-in-waiting, bragged to Fox News that the committee had damaged Hillary in the polls—an amazing contention that belied Gowdy\u0027s and Boehner\u0027s endless assertions that there was nothing partisan about the committee. Not only did McCarthy\u0027s comments appear to cost him the speakership, they gave ammo to Clinton, whose campaign featured the impromptu confession in a commercial. If that wasn\u0027t bad enough for Gowdy\u0027s committee, a recently fired investigator named Bradley Podliska then gave interviews to CNN and The New York Times that further painted the operation as a booze-fueled, Clinton-obsessed witch hunt.  \u000A\u000AAll of which makes Thursday\u0027s hearing as critical now for Gowdy as it is for Clinton. Can the clever lawyer somehow restore the committee\u0027s patina of professionalism and undo the impression that it\u0027s a partisan Clinton smear project? Gowdy feels he\u0027s ready to meet his moment. \u0022I was a mediocre lawyer for a long time,\u0022 he told me one recent morning in South Carolina, \u0022so what I lack in talent I make up for in experience.\u0022 All politicians traffic in false modesty, but Gowdy, who speaks in a laid-back southern frat-boy twang, is so good at it, he actually seems humble. Of course, it\u0027s not humility as much as cunning he ﬂashes when he points out that he\u0027s not trying to derail Clinton. \u0022I do not view it as my job to ‘Stop Secretary Clinton,\u0027 \u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A\u0022I would not take the briefing from the FBI if it came with\u000AVictoria\u0027s Secret models,\u0022 Gowdy says. \u0022Because if there was a leak,\u000AI don\u0027t want anybody to say it\u0027s me.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000ANever mind that at two o\u0027clock that morning he was wide awake reﬁning the six-page list of questions he planned to put to her. No, Gowdy insists that he doesn\u0027t have it in for Hillary. \u0022I literally did not mention her name the ﬁrst three hearings we had,\u0022 he told me, explaining that upending Clinton\u0027s campaign isn\u0027t the chore he signed up for. That is \u0022the job of ﬁll-in-the-blank: Reince Priebus or whoever the [presidential] nominee is. That\u0027s not my job.\u0022\u000A\u000AStatements like that are exactly what had been making Gowdy so effective as a potential Clinton slayer. After all, the more his committee can appear to be free of partisan intent, the better the chances the GOP has of achieving a partisan outcome. In other words, more than any other conservative who has taken on the duty of stopping the Clintons over the years, Gowdy has—despite the blunders of his allies—gotten the closest to succeeding at it.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIf Hillary Clinton doesn\u0027t end up in the Oval Office, it will be because somebody else—Jeb? Joe? Trump?!—wins at the polls. But make no mistake: That victory will be owed in large part to Gowdy, who has already thrown her off course.\u000A\u000ABy this point on the calendar, after all, she had planned to be well on her way to securing the Democratic nomination—not preparing to troop up to Capitol Hill, yet again, to answer questions, yet again, about yet another Clinton scandal.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestUntil recently, Gowdy says, he was a congressional nobody. His war with Clinton is making him a star.\u000A\u000ABut when you put it that way, the most surprising aspect of the whole e-mail episode isn\u0027t that Clinton\u0027s soft glide to the White House has now been interrupted, but rather that we ever bought into the delusion that a coronation would be simple for her. For 25 years now, the Republicans have used every opportunity to attack, investigate, and otherwise foil the march of the Clintons. And for those same 25 years, Bill and Hillary have invariably aided these efforts by supplying grist for the GOP scandal mill.\u000A\u000AIn the case of the e-mail scandal, Clinton haters found something that perfectly conforms to the long-running narrative of deviousness they\u0027ve pushed: that the Clintons are secretive, calculating, and forever breaking the rules. Hillary\u0027s own ham-ﬁsted attempts to explain matters—she\u0027s tried being defensive, she\u0027s tried laughing it all off, she\u0027s even tried a kind of grudging apology—haven\u0027t helped. But then, history tells us that Clinton responses rarely help contain the whiff of scandal.\u000A\u000AThe saving grace for them has always been that despite the Clintons\u0027 own screwups, their Republican inquisitors have inevitably comported themselves worse. Time and again, it\u0027s looked as if the Clintons have been backed into a corner, only to slip away when their foes overreached. For months, it appeared as if Republicans would avoid repeating that mistake this time around. In Gowdy, they had their shrewdest inquisitor yet.  \u000A\u000AFor one thing, he\u0027s tended to steer clear of the spotlight—proving to be the rare congressman who doesn\u0027t jump at the chance to wield a gavel on TV by holding public hearings. Most of the select committee\u0027s work has been conducted in private. Clinton\u0027s testimony will be only its fourth public hearing. The previous three were total snoozes. \u0022My goal,\u0022 Gowdy told me, \u0022is not to be exciting.\u0022  \u000A\u000ATo bone up for October\u0027s showdown, Gowdy has been watching videos of\u000AClinton\u0027s appearances before Congress, scouting her strengths and\u000Aweaknesses.Twitter\u000A\u000AGowdy\u0027s also shown restraint, and a bit of humanity, where others might not have. When he discovered that a key potential witness, a former CIA officer named Tyler Drumheller, who was sending private intelligence about Libya to Clinton through their mutual friend Sidney Blumenthal, had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, he did not call Drumheller in for questioning. \u0022It\u0027s just really hard for me to say, ‘I want you to take one of the last days you have and do this,\u0027 \u0022 Gowdy explained to me. Drumheller\u0027s \u0022time was probably better spent around people that he loved and that loved him.\u0022  \u000A\u000AMost of all—and most vexing to Clinton—Gowdy has managed to avoid the mission creep that has hobbled so many of the past efforts to bring her and her husband down. Although Democrats have seized on the former staffer Podliska\u0027s accusations that the committee zeroed in on Clinton rather than other avenues of investigation, even that focus on Clinton has been relatively restrained. Gowdy\u0027s refrained from indulging in conspiracy theories about Hillary and Benghazi—like that Clinton issued a \u0022stand down\u0022 order that prevented a military response, or that the Libyan consulate was being used for illegal arms shipments—and he hasn\u0027t been nearly as aggressive as others might have been about the e-mail system the committee helped to uncover. Gowdy says he\u0027s only after correspondence related to Benghazi and has no interest in whether, for instance, Clinton\u0027s other e-mails contained classiﬁed information. \u0022If you may ﬁnd facts that are interesting and relevant that are outside the jurisdiction, you\u0027ve got two options: You can go back and enlarge it to include that, or you can say, ‘Well, that\u0027s for somebody else to determine,\u0027 \u0022 Gowdy says. \u0022My jurisdiction has not been enlarged, and I don\u0027t want it enlarged.\u0022  \u000A\u000AThe clever result has been that certain matters beyond Gowdy\u0027s carefully policed purview have fallen into the laps of investigators who are less easily dismissed as partisan witch-hunters. For instance, the intelligence agencies\u0027 inspector general, not Gowdy, investigated whether Clinton improperly sent and received classiﬁed e-mail; and it\u0027s the FBI, not Gowdy, that is reportedly investigating the security of Clinton\u0027s private e-mail server. I say \u0022reportedly\u0022 because even Gowdy claims not to know what, exactly, the FBI is looking into. And he says the less he knows, the better. \u0022I would not take the brieﬁng from the FBI if it came with Victoria\u0027s Secret models,\u0022 Gowdy told me. \u0022I don\u0027t want to know, because if there was a leak, I don\u0027t want anybody to say it\u0027s me.\u0022  \u000A\u000AYet despite his professed aversion to seeing information trickle out inappropriately, plenty of it has. That\u0027s why Gowdy\u0027s Democratic critics—and some journalists, too—believe that the committee has leaked like a sieve, pointing to a series of media reports that they say could only have come from Gowdy or the six other Republicans on the 12-member committee. Like the New York Times story back in March that ﬁrst broke the news about Clinton\u0027s private e-mail address. Or the more recent story revealing that the former Clinton staffer who set up the e-mail system had told the committee he\u0027d plead the Fifth.  \u000A\u000ADemocrats say Gowdy has no interest in an impartial investigation—they note that despite all the leaks, testimony that makes Clinton look good never seems to get released. \u0022I think Trey says a lot of the right things and certainly doesn\u0027t engage in the kind of hyperbole of some of the others that have gone before him,\u0022 Adam Schiff, a California congressman and a Democratic member of the Benghazi committee, told me. \u0022But he is acting in an equally partisan way. Tragically, it\u0027s become a committee with very little focus on Benghazi and instead is obsessed with attempting to derail Secretary Clinton\u0027s campaign.\u0022  \u000A\u000AWhen he ponders these complaints, Gowdy affects a sorrowful, almost wounded tone—though he steadfastly refuses to return ﬁre at the Democrats, lest he undermine his claims of bipartisanship. Of course, he denies the charges of leaking. Though Gowdy doesn\u0027t sound too chagrined that reporters have gotten their hands on certain information—or that the media have rather helpfully ampliﬁed some anti-Clinton claims that would seem partisan if he\u0027d shared them. \u0022Nothing advances things like a media story does,\u0022 Gowdy told me. \u0022A Republican congressman from South Carolina saying X really doesn\u0027t garner that much attention.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOn the desk in Gowdy\u0027s office on Capitol Hill, he keeps pictures of the four Americans killed in the Benghazi attacks, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens. Just as when he was a prosecutor, he wants to do right by the dead and their families. \u0022I never expected to be doing homicide cases in Congress,\u0022 he says. \u0022Maybe because I did do homicide cases and I am so well acquainted with the ﬁnality of death, having met with the family members of the four, that is enough for me. And when I meet with them again, I can say, ‘This is what I found out that you didn\u0027t know previously.\u0027 That is all the success I need.\u0022  \u000A\u000AAnd the families seem to appreciate it. \u0022Get answers, please!\u0022 Patricia Smith, whose 34-year-old son was killed in the attack, has publicly beseeched Gowdy—which has made it that much tougher for Clinton\u0027s defenders to portray the South Carolina congressman as some sort of Inspector Javert.  \u000A\u000ATo bone up for his showdown with Clinton, the old prosecutor has lately been watching videos of her past appearances before Congress, scouting her strengths and weaknesses. This time around, her vaunted skill at running out the ﬁve minutes allotted to a congressman\u0027s question will be useless; Clinton has promised to testify for as long as it takes to answer all of the committee\u0027s questions.  \u000A\u000AFor her part, Clinton\u0027s team is dispensing with the usual game of lowering expectations. The gift of McCarthy\u0027s comments has made Thursday the last best chance to put the e-mail mess to rest—and Clinton campaign officials have been privately boasting about the \u0022war room\u0022 from which they\u0027ll direct spin during and after the hearings. Some supporters even predict that Hillary, riding high after a composed and impressive debate performance last week, will use the hearings to her advantage. \u0022I expect she\u0027ll run circles around them,\u0022 Brock says of Hillary\u0027s Republican tormentors. But even if Clinton succeeds in quieting the e-mail questions, the episode has inﬂicted damage that won\u0027t be undone. That\u0027s because Gowdy and his investigation have already changed the terms on which Clinton\u0027s presidential campaign will be run.  \u000A\u000AGone forever are those heady days, just after Clinton jumped in the race, when she pledged to run as an optimistic trailblazer. Thanks to Gowdy—and a summer spent bogged down in talk of testimony and leaks and secret servers—we know voters won\u0027t get that kind of campaign. Not out of the Republicans and not out of Clinton. If Hillary Clinton wants to win the White House, she\u0027ll now have to win ugly, in that grinding, divisive, and soul-crushing way that the Clintons have always won.  \u000A\u000AAnd in that sense, Gowdy has won, too. Although he swears up and down he has no ambition for higher office—he rebuffed the recent entreaties that he run for Majority Leader and Speaker—he can\u0027t help but notice his newfound notoriety. Thanks to his reputation as a potential Hillary warrior, he\u0027s already a popular draw on the GOP fund-raising circuit—traveling all over the country to rake in the bucks for his fellow Republicans.  \u000A\u000AHe even gets stopped on the street. Gowdy recalls a recent encounter at the Charlotte airport as he and a fellow South Carolina Republican congressman, Mick Mulvaney, were making their way home. \u0022This guy comes up and says, ‘I\u0027m a big fan,\u0027 \u0022 Gowdy tells me. \u0022I say, ‘Well, thank you. Let me introduce you to your congressman. This is Mick Mulvaney.\u0027 He goes, ‘I don\u0027t care anything about Mick Mulvaney.\u0027 I say, ‘Well, here he is, right here with me.\u0027 And he says, ‘Well, hey, Mick, will you take a picture of me and Congressman Gowdy?\u0027 \u0022  \u000A\u000AAs he recounted the tale, Gowdy beamed. Getting recognized as the guy who could vanquish a Clinton sure beats being known as the guy with the haircut.\u000A\u000AJason Zengerle is GQ\u0027s political correspondent.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ARead More:Hillary Clinton\u0027s Private E-mails Read Like a Script from The OfficeThe Most Slytherin Hair in All of Congress",

data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.2">It wasn&#x2019;t so long ago that the third-term Republican congressman from South Carolina was a virtual nonentity on Capitol Hill, a point he concedes himself. &#x201C;I would not be on the list of what I believe to be the top 20 most effective members of Congress,&#x201D; Gowdy told me. To the extent he was known at all, it was for his golf handicap (a 1.7, he says, the lowest in the House) and for his bewildering haircut&#x2014;an ever-changing coiffure that has rotated between a faux-hawk, a slick-back, and a modi&#xFB01;ed mullet. And yet, in the last several weeks, Gowdy has been pestered&#x2014;at times outright begged&#x2014;by his congressional Republican colleagues to take McCarthy&#x2019;s place as Majority Leader and Boehner&#x2019;s as Speaker of the House.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.3">And on Thursday, the very thing that has made Gowdy one of the most important Republicans in Congress will make him the most important Republican in America. That&#x2019;s because the hopes and fever dreams of a vast multitude of conservatives will be vested in him that day, when, as chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, he&#x2019;ll publicly grill Hillary Clinton about her private e-mail server. It&#x2019;s a long-awaited showdown that&#x2019;s now suddenly billed as a political Super Bowl, a potentially golden opportunity for both Clinton&#x2019;s detractors <em>and</em> her defenders.  </p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.5"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.6">The genesis of Thursday&#x2019;s spectacle&#x2014;as well as Gowdy&#x2019;s newfound notoriety and the whole Benghazi committee&#x2014;can be traced to a morning last May in the congressman&#x2019;s backyard. While Gowdy mowed the lawn behind his Spartanburg, South Carolina, home, his phone began to ring, with Boehner on the other end.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.7">Nearly two years had passed since the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, but Boehner and House Republicans still sniffed opportunity in the conspiracy theories swirling around then Secretary of State Clinton&#x2019;s response to the assault. Four Americans had died, and conservatives &#xFB01;gured that Clinton had been guilty of, at best, negligence or, at worst, a despicable cover-up. With a presidential campaign on the horizon, they glimpsed a perfect time to create a special committee to dig around on Benghazi and, by extension, Clinton.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.8">And this is where Gowdy came in: Before he was a ho-hum congressman, he was a spectacular lawyer, a crusading prosecutor with a specialty in long-unsolved murder cases. He&#x2019;d be the perfect guy to clear up a Libyan cold case&#x2014;and maybe lend a partisan crusade the sheen of professionalism and objectivity, too.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.9">Gowdy &#xFB01;nished up the backyard and noticed his missed call. When he rang his boss back, he heard the Speaker&#x2019;s familiar nicotine baritone: &#x201C;Thinking about doing this committee thing. Don&#x2019;t say anything. I&#x2019;ll call you back later this afternoon.&#x201D;  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.a">The news raised a pressing question for Gowdy&#x2014;a practical concern that wouldn&#x2019;t likely occur to anyone in his position. He wanted to know if he had time to &#xFB01;nish mowing his lawn. &#x201C;How soon will you call back?&#x201D; he asked the Speaker. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve still got to cut the front yard.&#x201D;  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.b">&#x201C;Go cut the yard, son,&#x201D; Boehner replied.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.c">Gowdy, who is 51, was told later that afternoon that he&#x2019;d be chairing the House Select Committee on Benghazi. And in the past 18 months he&#x2019;s quietly overseen interviews with nearly four dozen witnesses in private sessions (the most recent last Friday, with longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin), for a highly anticipated report the committee hopes to release early next year.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.d">Of course, for all the closed-door testimony, the committee&#x2019;s most important discovery is already notoriously public and plenty damaging to the Clinton campaign. Gowdy&#x2019;s investigators unearthed eight e-mail messages that contained a private address used by Clinton. This led in March to the realization that she had been using a private server installed in her home. The mystery of why she used the secret server&#x2014;and the myriad GOP fantasies about what she kept hidden with it&#x2014;has obviously become a central story line in the early drama of the Clinton campaign.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.e">And it&#x2019;s changed the course of Gowdy&#x2019;s career. If the congressman has become an avenging angel and a rising star to his fellow Republicans, to Democrats Gowdy&#x2019;s now considered a villainous hatchet man. &#x201C;Boehner made a decision to launch a partisan investigation, and Gowdy&#x2019;s carrying that out,&#x201D; says David Brock, the author and former right-wing attack dog who has become a staunch Clinton defender.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.f">That&#x2019;s an argument that gained credibility in recent weeks as the Benghazi committee, after 18 months of seemingly careful work, has suddenly become a circus. In September, McCarthy, the House Majority Leader and then Speaker-in-waiting, bragged to Fox News that the committee had damaged Hillary in the polls&#x2014;an amazing contention that belied Gowdy&#x2019;s and Boehner&#x2019;s endless assertions that there was nothing partisan about the committee. Not only did McCarthy&#x2019;s comments appear to cost him the speakership, they gave ammo to Clinton, whose campaign featured the impromptu confession in a commercial. If that wasn&#x2019;t bad enough for Gowdy&#x2019;s committee, a recently fired investigator named Bradley Podliska then gave interviews to CNN and <em>The New York Times</em> that further painted the operation as a booze-fueled, Clinton-obsessed witch hunt.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.g">All of which makes Thursday&#x2019;s hearing as critical now for Gowdy as it is for Clinton. Can the clever lawyer somehow restore the committee&#x2019;s patina of professionalism and undo the impression that it&#x2019;s a partisan Clinton smear project? Gowdy feels he&#x2019;s ready to meet his moment. &#x201C;I was a mediocre lawyer for a long time,&#x201D; he told me one recent morning in South Carolina, &#x201C;so what I lack in talent I make up for in experience.&#x201D; All politicians traffic in false modesty, but Gowdy, who speaks in a laid-back southern frat-boy twang, is so good at it, he actually seems humble. Of course, it&#x2019;s not humility as much as cunning he &#xFB02;ashes when he points out that he&#x2019;s not trying to derail Clinton. &#x201C;I do not view it as my job to &#x2018;Stop Secretary Clinton,&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; he says.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.h"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&#x201C;I would not take the briefing from the FBI if it came with

No, Gowdy insists that he doesn&#x2019;t have it in for Hillary. &#x201C;I literally did not mention her name the &#xFB01;rst three hearings we had,&#x201D; he told me, explaining that upending Clinton&#x2019;s campaign isn&#x2019;t the chore he signed up for. That is &#x201C;the job of &#xFB01;ll-in-the-blank: Reince Priebus or whoever the [presidential] nominee is. That&#x2019;s not my job.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.j">Statements like that are exactly what had been making Gowdy so effective as a potential Clinton slayer. After all, the more his committee can appear to be free of partisan intent, the better the chances the GOP has of achieving a partisan outcome. In other words, more than any other conservative who has taken on the duty of stopping the Clintons over the years, Gowdy has&#x2014;despite the blunders of his allies&#x2014;gotten the closest to succeeding at it.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.k"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>If Hillary Clinton doesn&#x2019;t</strong> end up in the Oval Office, it will be because somebody else&#x2014;Jeb?

For 25 years now, the Republicans have used every opportunity to attack, investigate, and otherwise foil the march of the Clintons. And for those same 25 years, Bill and Hillary have invariably aided these efforts by supplying grist for the GOP scandal mill.</p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.p">In the case of the e-mail scandal, Clinton haters found something that perfectly conforms to the long-running narrative of deviousness they&#x2019;ve pushed: that the Clintons are secretive, calculating, and forever breaking the rules. Hillary&#x2019;s own ham-&#xFB01;sted attempts to explain matters&#x2014;she&#x2019;s tried being defensive, she&#x2019;s tried laughing it all off, she&#x2019;s even tried a kind of grudging apology&#x2014;haven&#x2019;t helped. But then, history tells us that Clinton responses rarely help contain the whiff of scandal.</p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.q">The saving grace for them has always been that despite the Clintons&#x2019; own screwups, their Republican inquisitors have inevitably comported themselves worse. Time and again, it&#x2019;s looked as if the Clintons have been backed into a corner, only to slip away when their foes overreached. For months, it appeared as if Republicans would avoid repeating that mistake this time around. In Gowdy, they had their shrewdest inquisitor yet.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.r">For one thing, he&#x2019;s tended to steer clear of the spotlight&#x2014;proving to be the rare congressman who doesn&#x2019;t jump at the chance to wield a gavel on TV by holding public hearings. Most of the select committee&#x2019;s work has been conducted in private. Clinton&#x2019;s testimony will be only its fourth public hearing. The previous three were total snoozes. &#x201C;My goal,&#x201D; Gowdy told me, &#x201C;is not to be exciting.&#x201D;  </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.s"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>To bone up for October&#x2019;s showdown, Gowdy has been watching videos of

When he discovered that a key potential witness, a former CIA officer named Tyler Drumheller, who was sending private intelligence about Libya to Clinton through their mutual friend Sidney Blumenthal, had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, he did not call Drumheller in for questioning. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s just really hard for me to say, &#x2018;I want you to take one of the last days you have and do this,&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; Gowdy explained to me. Drumheller&#x2019;s &#x201C;time was probably better spent around people that he loved and that loved him.&#x201D;  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.u">Most of all&#x2014;and most vexing to Clinton&#x2014;Gowdy has managed to avoid the mission creep that has hobbled so many of the past efforts to bring her and her husband down. Although Democrats have seized on the former staffer Podliska&#x2019;s accusations that the committee zeroed in on Clinton rather than other avenues of investigation, even that focus on Clinton has been relatively restrained. Gowdy&#x2019;s refrained from indulging in conspiracy theories about Hillary and Benghazi&#x2014;like that Clinton issued a &#x201C;stand down&#x201D; order that prevented a military response, or that the Libyan consulate was being used for illegal arms shipments&#x2014;and he hasn&#x2019;t been nearly as aggressive as others might have been about the e-mail system the committee helped to uncover. Gowdy says he&#x2019;s only after correspondence related to Benghazi and has no interest in whether, for instance, Clinton&#x2019;s other e-mails contained classi&#xFB01;ed information. &#x201C;If you may &#xFB01;nd facts that are interesting and relevant that are outside the jurisdiction, you&#x2019;ve got two options: You can go back and enlarge it to include that, or you can say, &#x2018;Well, that&#x2019;s for somebody else to determine,&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; Gowdy says. &#x201C;My jurisdiction has not been enlarged, and I don&#x2019;t want it enlarged.&#x201D;  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.v">The clever result has been that certain matters beyond Gowdy&#x2019;s carefully policed purview have fallen into the laps of investigators who are less easily dismissed as partisan witch-hunters. For instance, the intelligence agencies&#x2019; inspector general, not Gowdy, investigated whether Clinton improperly sent and received classi&#xFB01;ed e-mail; and it&#x2019;s the FBI, not Gowdy, that is reportedly investigating the security of Clinton&#x2019;s private e-mail server. I say &#x201C;reportedly&#x201D; because even Gowdy claims not to know what, exactly, the FBI is looking into. And he says the less he knows, the better. &#x201C;I would not take the brie&#xFB01;ng from the FBI if it came with Victoria&#x2019;s Secret models,&#x201D; Gowdy told me. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to know, because if there was a leak, I don&#x2019;t want anybody to say it&#x2019;s me.&#x201D;  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.w">Yet despite his professed aversion to seeing information trickle out inappropriately, plenty of it has. That&#x2019;s why Gowdy&#x2019;s Democratic critics&#x2014;and some journalists, too&#x2014;believe that the committee has leaked like a sieve, pointing to a series of media reports that they say could only have come from Gowdy or the six other Republicans on the 12-member committee. Like the <em>New York Times</em> story back in March that &#xFB01;rst broke the news about Clinton&#x2019;s private e-mail address. Or the more recent story revealing that the former Clinton staffer who set up the e-mail system had told the committee he&#x2019;d plead the Fifth.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.x">Democrats say Gowdy has no interest in an impartial investigation&#x2014;they note that despite all the leaks, testimony that makes Clinton look good never seems to get released. &#x201C;I think Trey says a lot of the right things and certainly doesn&#x2019;t engage in the kind of hyperbole of some of the others that have gone before him,&#x201D; Adam Schiff, a California congressman and a Democratic member of the Benghazi committee, told me. &#x201C;But he is acting in an equally partisan way. Tragically, it&#x2019;s become a committee with very little focus on Benghazi and instead is obsessed with attempting to derail Secretary Clinton&#x2019;s campaign.&#x201D;  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.y">When he ponders these complaints, Gowdy affects a sorrowful, almost wounded tone&#x2014;though he steadfastly refuses to return &#xFB01;re at the Democrats, lest he undermine his claims of bipartisanship. Of course, he denies the charges of leaking. Though Gowdy doesn&#x2019;t sound too chagrined that reporters have gotten their hands on certain information&#x2014;or that the media have rather helpfully ampli&#xFB01;ed some anti-Clinton claims that would seem partisan if he&#x2019;d shared them. &#x201C;Nothing advances things like a media story does,&#x201D; Gowdy told me. &#x201C;A Republican congressman from South Carolina saying X really doesn&#x2019;t garner that much attention.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.z"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong>On the desk in</strong> Gowdy&#x2019;s office on Capitol Hill, he keeps pictures of the four Americans killed in the Benghazi attacks, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens. Just as when he was a prosecutor, he wants to do right by the dead and their families. &#x201C;I never expected to be doing homicide cases in Congress,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Maybe because I did do homicide cases and I am so well acquainted with the &#xFB01;nality of death, having met with the family members of the four, that is enough for me. And when I meet with them again, I can say, &#x2018;This is what I found out that you didn&#x2019;t know previously.&#x2019; That is all the success I need.&#x201D;  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.11">And the families seem to appreciate it. &#x201C;Get answers, please!&#x201D; Patricia Smith, whose 34-year-old son was killed in the attack, has publicly beseeched Gowdy&#x2014;which has made it that much tougher for Clinton&#x2019;s defenders to portray the South Carolina congressman as some sort of Inspector Javert.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.12">To bone up for his showdown with Clinton, the old prosecutor has lately been watching videos of her past appearances before Congress, scouting her strengths and weaknesses. This time around, her vaunted skill at running out the &#xFB01;ve minutes allotted to a congressman&#x2019;s question will be useless; Clinton has promised to testify for as long as it takes to answer all of the committee&#x2019;s questions.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.13">For her part, Clinton&#x2019;s team is dispensing with the usual game of lowering expectations. The gift of McCarthy&#x2019;s comments has made Thursday the last best chance to put the e-mail mess to rest&#x2014;and Clinton campaign officials have been privately boasting about the &#x201C;war room&#x201D; from which they&#x2019;ll direct spin during and after the hearings. Some supporters even predict that Hillary, riding high after a composed and impressive debate performance last week, will use the hearings to her advantage. &#x201C;I expect she&#x2019;ll run circles around them,&#x201D; Brock says of Hillary&#x2019;s Republican tormentors. But even if Clinton succeeds in quieting the e-mail questions, the episode has in&#xFB02;icted damage that won&#x2019;t be undone. That&#x2019;s because Gowdy and his investigation have already changed the terms on which Clinton&#x2019;s presidential campaign will be run.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.14">Gone forever are those heady days, just after Clinton jumped in the race, when she pledged to run as an optimistic trailblazer. Thanks to Gowdy&#x2014;and a summer spent bogged down in talk of testimony and leaks and secret servers&#x2014;we know voters won&#x2019;t get that kind of campaign. Not out of the Republicans and not out of Clinton. If Hillary Clinton wants to win the White House, she&#x2019;ll now have to win ugly, in that grinding, divisive, and soul-crushing way that the Clintons have always won.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.15">And in that sense, Gowdy has won, too. Although he swears up and down he has no ambition for higher office&#x2014;he rebuffed the recent entreaties that he run for Majority Leader and Speaker&#x2014;he can&#x2019;t help but notice his newfound notoriety. Thanks to his reputation as a potential Hillary warrior, he&#x2019;s already a popular draw on the GOP fund-raising circuit&#x2014;traveling all over the country to rake in the bucks for his fellow Republicans.  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.16">He even gets stopped on the street. Gowdy recalls a recent encounter at the Charlotte airport as he and a fellow South Carolina Republican congressman, Mick Mulvaney, were making their way home. &#x201C;This guy comes up and says, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m a big fan,&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; Gowdy tells me. &#x201C;I say, &#x2018;Well, thank you. Let me introduce you to your congressman. This is Mick Mulvaney.&#x2019; He goes, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t care anything about Mick Mulvaney.&#x2019; I say, &#x2018;Well, here he is, right here with me.&#x2019; And he says, &#x2018;Well, hey, Mick, will you take a picture of me and Congressman Gowdy?&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D;  </p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.17">As he recounted the tale, Gowdy beamed. Getting recognized as the guy who could vanquish a Clinton sure beats being known as the guy with the haircut.</p><p data-reactid=".1ir6tn31hxc.1.1.0.0.4.18"><strong><a
