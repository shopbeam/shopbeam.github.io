  	    "articleBody": "\u0022Keep going straight here,\u0022  Joe Biden says. We\u0027ve been at this for hours, climbing  in and out of the SUV to look at stuff, a water tower,  a stone wall, the house where the most beautiful girl  in the world lived, hoagies, Herman the German\u0027s  gas station, Meyers-eats-tires tire shop, the house where another most beautiful girl in the world lived, and he\u0027s holding up better than the rest of us. He never winces,  has no achy knees, no lower-back anything, neck, joints; for the guy rockin\u0027 the Ray-Ban  aviators, 70 is the new 60. \u0022Wait, there\u0027s Little Italy down there,\u0022 he says, peering out the window. \u0022A lot of great Italian restaurants. If there\u0027s anybody down there who doesn\u0027t vote for me, I haven\u0027t found them yet. But I will. I will.\u000A\u000A\u0022Okay, in the interest of time, we\u0027ll stop here. Let\u0027s get out here.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s his old street. His house. Small white brick. Black shutters. Cement path. A perfectly average 1950s American neighborhood in Wilmington, Delaware, now with a motorcade parked along Wilson Road and Secret Service guys swarming and the vice president of the United States wandering, leading fast. \u0022Hi there,\u0022 he says to a guy with a leaf blower. \u0022I lived here for twenty years. Mack? Hey, Mack. I\u0027m Joe. You\u0027re living in a house a guy named Kenny Horn used to live in. Kenny Horn.\u000A\u000A\u0022Okay, the driveway, watch yourself. So this is the house. That was my bedroom. I lived there with my brothers Jimmy, Frankie, and my Uncle Ed. One bureau, four drawers, everybody got a drawer. My sister, the princess Valerie, had her own room. Which was ten by twelve. But she deserved it. And my dad took great pride in having that barbecue pit.\u0022 He circles  the house, heads to the back door. \u0022I wish  I knew who lived here, because I would show you my room.\u0022\u000A\u000AUncle Ed, they called him Uncle Boo-Boo. Brilliant guy. Sprawling intellect.  He stuttered. Way worse than Biden stuttered as a boy, which was bad enough. Uncle Boo-Boo never got past it. Never married. Dud job. Drank. Drank a lot. He served as an example of what could happen if you didn\u0027t rehearse, didn\u0027t practice getting your mouth unstuck. Biden has never had a drink.\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, what the hell.\u0022 He charges up to the back door, knocks. \u0022Hello? Hello?\u0022 We stand on the back deck, waiting. Two Secret Service guys have their backs to us, stationed like owls by the picket fence.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A\u0022He wants to be the best vice president ever,\u0022 staffers told me, months ago, when I first started spending time with Joe Biden. That was all the talk last winter. Hillary would almost certainly be the nominee, not Biden, they said, whenever the 2016 issue came up, which wasn\u0027t often. But then, abruptly, Biden\u0027s stock started steeply rising, at least in the eyes of the public. Washington had been hyperventilating about the fiscal cliff, and Obama sent Biden in to broker a deal. Then came the killings in Newtown, Connecticut, and Obama sent Biden out to rally the public, Biden in to reason with Congress,  Biden over to talk to the NRA. In 2013, Biden has emerged increasingly more visibly potent than his boss. THE MOST INFLUENTIAL VICE PRESIDENT IN HISTORY? one headline proffered.\u000A\u000A\u0022Well, he would be crazy not to keep his options open,\u0022 staffers started saying then, whenever the 2016 issue came up. Which still wasn\u0027t often. The parlor game was not my reason for being there. I wanted to get to know Biden. I wanted to understand why \u0022President Joe Biden\u0022 has such a  preposterous ring to it, and I wanted to know if he knew it did.\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a joke. Something fundamentally comical. That\u0027s where the public starts with Biden. I recognized it in Rome, when I traveled with him to the pope\u0027s inauguration. He was meeting with friends, presidents from across the globe. Because Joe Biden has been at this so long, don\u0027t forget, that he is the stuff of middle-school civics exams. I saw him freelance a grand Joe Biden entrance into President Giorgio Napolitano\u0027s palace, teeth gleaming, arms fully outstretched, ready to hug this guy, that guy, Hey, guys! I\u0027m here! You\u0027re here! We\u0027re beautiful! Decked out in his smooth blue suit, white pocket square—his broad smile the kind a man reserves for his bowling team. This demeanor contrasted sharply with everyone else\u0027s. Guards in shiny helmets sprouting horsehair ponytails, bedraggled White House advance team in smart skirts and solid-color pumps. A Biden entrance can make the stuffiest event intimate, for an instant human  and vaguely...funny.\u000A\u000ASunshine, apt and miraculous, broke through the day of the pope\u0027s installation Mass. \u0022Your Holiness, this is my sister, Valerie,\u0022 Biden said. The pope. Joe Biden and the pope. Val was next to him in her long black chapel veil, the two of them together at church just like back in Wilmington, and Scranton before. Except it was the Vatican. In the reception line, Val didn\u0027t kiss the pope\u0027s ring, and Biden didn\u0027t kiss the pope\u0027s ring (to be fair, plenty of people didn\u0027t kiss the pope\u0027s ring), because they are Bidens, equal, not below or above anyone, not the pope, not some schlub on the street. \u0022Nobody is better than you.\u0022 That\u0027s the message their mom hammered into their heads. \u0022You\u0027re not better than anybody, but nobody is better than you.\u0022\u000A\u000AJOE BIDEN DOESN\u0027T KISS UP TO ANYONE, international headlines read later that day, which made it sound way more hostile than his mom ever meant it.\u000A\u000AThen an image was tweeted, and for a time retweeted, a picture of Biden in the crowd of worshippers outside Saint Peter\u0027s Basilica during the holiest Mass of the twenty-first century. The photo is jammed with faces, Biden in the center of them  all. Plenty have on sunglasses. But Biden has on his signature Ray-Bans—the aviators!—and that was what, above all else about his whirlwind trip to Rome, was inexplicably spectacular.\u000A\u000AVice fucking president of the United States. You get the feeling Joe Biden would love to put it that way, to stand in a crowd of thousands in his aviators and say, \u0022Yo, I\u0027m the vice fucking president of the United States, y\u0027all.\u0022 Which he has never said. But you think he might. That\u0027s what\u0027s funny. It\u0027s a comfort level, and a mocking, and a kind of affection wrapped warmly into a knowing joke. Joe Biden. The tipsy uncle who actually doesn\u0027t drink. He\u0027s always dancing there on the edge of embarrassment. He\u0027s that guy. He might put a lampshade on his head.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s odd, probably, that the vice president of the United States is wandering around like this, trying to get in the room he slept in when he was 10. But here we are. \u0022You can see the old porch, Shailagh, see it?\u0022 Shailagh Murray is his communications director, a former Washington Post political reporter—she\u0027s Irish, she\u0027s Catholic, she gets him, he loves her. \u0022This deck wasn\u0027t here,\u0022 he says. \u0022Oh, I used to come out here and put pebbles in my mouth, try to shout against that wall. One of the ways I tried...\u0022 Tried to learn to speak without his face freezing up.\u000A\u000AHe knocks again. \u0022I guess they\u0027re not home.\u0022 He peers through the back window. \u0022Take a look at the dining room, Shailagh. The china closet against the wall? See how the wall comes out a little bit? Val would hide in there. Reach out with a wet glove when I came in late so I would scream, wake my mom, worked every time.\u000A\u000A\u0022Anyway.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHe leads us back to the SUV. \u0022Okay, let\u0027s go, let\u0027s see.\u0022 He\u0027s trim, has the square shoulders of an athlete, dressed in a blue blazer, striped shirt, khakis. All day he\u0027s had something specific mapped in his head, has not told us the itinerary. Back in Washington, he tells stories about Wilmington all the time, but the staff has never seen this  stuff live. \u0022You think I\u0027m making it up, Shailagh, but I\u0027m not.\u0022\u000A\u000ATwo cars lead the motorcade, and two trail it. We\u0027re in the center, in the silver SUV with bulletproof doors. Shailagh has graciously climbed into the way-back. The guy murmuring into the air up front is John, Biden\u0027s senior Secret Service guy. Spider, left, pull up to the stop sign. Biden calls him Johnny, considers him a pal. John pulls me aside. \u0022So,\u0022 he asks, \u0022is this what you expected of the vice president of the United States?\u0022 Guys in this unit used to guard Cheney. \u0022Night and day,\u0022 is all one will say of it. \u0022Night and day.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022A hundred yards, take another right,\u0022 Biden says. His voice now in the car is low, a kind of purr. \u0022My mom and my dad and my wife and my daughter are buried in this cemetery. Just stop at that stairwell here, okay? And we\u0027re going to get out here  for just a second.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe rhododendrons are in bloom. It\u0027s a perfect May day. His house in Wilmington, where he and Jill and the kids spend weekends, is about ten minutes from here, down a long, wooded lane. \u0022It says \u0027Tribute to the Irish powderman,\u0027 \u0022 he says, reading a stone carving. \u0022All those Irish powdermen worked for DuPont, Shailagh. That\u0027s how the du Ponts made their money.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Wow,\u0022 Shailagh says.\u000A\u000A\u0022Powdermen,\u0022 he says. There\u0027s a small church at the center of the graveyard. His church. All the kids\u0027 communions and confirmations. He loves the part about the Irish immigrants. He\u0027s an old-school devout Catholic, private. He\u0027s a dressed-up man who always wears a collar, does not understand T-shirts or sloppiness generally.\u000A\u000AHe steps confidently through the graveyard, bending over, reading tombstones. \u0022Okay, 1882. Here\u0027s 1842! Wait, I know there\u0027s some \u0027Born 1789\u0027 kinda thing.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt gets to where he\u0027s made the point enough times that the tombstones in this section are old, really, really old; there are only so many ways of saying it.\u000A\u000A\u0022My mother, my father, my wife, and my daughter are buried there,\u0022 he says again, pointing across the road to a completely different section of the cemetery. \u0022That section. New section. Right there. You see where that truck is?\u0022\u000A\u000AWe stand and look. It\u0027s maybe a football field away.\u000A\u000A\u0022Right there.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s too far away. We can\u0027t see anything.\u000A\u000A\u0022Should we walk over?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A\u0022It looks like there\u0027s a funeral about to come in. I don\u0027t want to disturb...\u0022\u000A\u000ABut there is no funeral coming in. There is no activity over there whatsoever.\u000A\u000A \u0022We shouldn\u0027t,\u0022 he says. His mother, his father, his wife, and his daughter. This is close enough. Close enough.\u000A\u000AWe stand for a moment longer, craning our necks, like civilians who can hear the bombs, see the smoke.\u000A\u000A\u0022The red maple? Just below the red maple. Everybody\u0027s there. Okay, let\u0027s get back in. Let\u0027s get back in.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A\u0022I can die a happy man never having been president of the United States of America,\u0022 he said one day at his residence in Washington. \u0022But it doesn\u0027t mean  I won\u0027t run.\u0022 We were in the sunroom, which without explanation he called \u0022the Cheney sunroom,\u0022 as if the specter of the last guy who lived here had never quite vanished. The king of Jordan had just left; they had breakfast.\u000A\u000AEvery vice president since Mondale has lived up on this hill, on the twelve-acre campus of the Naval Observatory in Northwest Washington. It\u0027s a pretty house with a wraparound porch and a white turret. In the garden, the aroma of boxwoods hung under the cover of mature magnolias. As living arrangements go, he said Barack and he both agree this place is way better than the White House. It was funny to hear him say \u0022Barack.\u0022 No one says \u0022Barack.\u0022 Then again, everyone says \u0022Joe.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABut about 2016: \u0022The judgment I\u0027ll make is, first of all, am I still as full of as much energy as I have now—do I feel this?\u0022 he said. \u0022Number two, do I think I\u0027m  the best person in the position to move the ball? And, you know, we\u0027ll see where  the hell I am.\u000A\u000A\u0022And by the way, if you come in the office, I have two portraits hanging—one of Jefferson, one of Adams. Both vice presidents who became presidents.\u0022 He said  he likes to look at their very satisfied expressions. \u0022I joke to myself, I wonder what their portraits looked like when they were vice presidents.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt was an intriguing image, and I wanted to ask him more about it, but there was no opening. Joe Biden does not pause. Points inside parentheticals, ideas emphatically chased. It\u0027s not that he fills up air like Romney might, or even tries to make a sale like Clinton. Biden\u0027s loquaciousness is more open than that. It\u0027s an athletic event.\u000A\u000A\u0022And I said, \u0027Why do you want me to be vice president?\u0027 \u0022 he told me, explaining that he never wanted the VP job, really he didn\u0027t, but Obama convinced him. \u0022He said, \u0027Help me govern. Joe, you do Iraq. Defense, State—talk to Joe, get it done. Recovery Act, almost a trillion dollars, do it, Joe!\u0027\u000A\u000A\u0022Not that I\u0027m so special,\u0022 he went on, \u0022or that he couldn\u0027t do it as well or better. But guess what, there was a war in Afghanistan going on at the same time, a banking system collapsing. It was a boulder rolling down a hill here. No matter who he was, now matter how brilliant—this guy is brilliant—he doesn\u0027t have the space on his desk to pick up all of those pieces.\u0022\u000A\u000ACo-captains, that\u0027s how he described his working relationship with Obama. Theirs is by all accounts a conjoined administration. At seven forty every morning, Obama\u0027s top advisers gather to set the day\u0027s agenda—together with other senior staff and Biden\u0027s top advisers, a blended, tangled family tree. Obama\u0027s press secretary used to be Biden\u0027s communications director. Biden\u0027s strategist is the brother of Obama\u0027s former national-security adviser; Biden\u0027s chief of staff co-authored a book with Obama\u0027s former chief of staff.\u000A\u000ARon Klain was Biden\u0027s chief of staff during his first term, and he saw how Biden changed up the job description compared with Al Gore, for whom Klain had also served as chief of staff. \u0022From day one,\u0022 Klain says, \u0022Al Gore planned on running for president. The project was to ready him. If the president was doing a public event, he was going to stand behind the president whether he had a role or not.\u000A\u000A\u0022Biden didn\u0027t have any interest in that. That was not the model he wanted. He put his political capital on helping Obama succeed. He wanted projects. Beginning, middle, and end projects.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe deal has worked for Biden, and the deal has also worked for Obama. They round each other out. Biden can say malarkey. Biden can hug, literally, Republicans. \u0022Joe Biden doesn\u0027t have a mean bone in his body,\u0022 says John McCain. \u0022He\u0027s unique from the day he was elected before he was 30 years old. He\u0027s unique in that he\u0027s had some role in every major national-security crisis that his nation has faced in the last thirty-five years. I don\u0027t know anyone like him in the U.S. Senate. Look at the number of times he\u0027s been able to conclude agreements. I would say he\u0027s been the most impactful vice president that I\u0027ve known—certainly in modern times.\u0022\u000A\u000ANot Cheney, McCain says. Biden.\u000A\u000A\u0022President Biden\u0022 does not sound preposterous to McCain. \u0022Suppose the economy comes on strong. He\u0027s bound to get credit.... Of course, the State of the Union speech would be the longest in history.\u0022\u000A\u000AChuck Hagel is one of Biden\u0027s best friends. John Kerry is one of Biden\u0027s best friends. Lindsey Graham is almost one of Biden\u0027s best friends. \u0022He\u0027s got a set of balls,\u0022 Michael Bloomberg said of Biden, and if they spend any more time together, they will definitely become best friends. And then there is his roster of palace pals around the world. It would take a lifetime for someone to build an infrastructure of so much trust, so many avenues, in so many corners of the world. When an old man dies, the saying goes, a library burns to the ground. For Biden, it would be an entire global network.\u000A\u000AIn Wilmington, the guy driving the SUV in front of us stops abruptly, curls into a U-turn. \u0022Ha!\u0022 Biden says. \u0022This guy is so gosh darn bad. I love him, but he\u0027s gonna get us killed.\u000A\u000A\u0022Okay, take a left, keep going. This is what they call Holy Rosary. Where the bingo sign is? The carnival sign? Now it\u0027s closed down. It was consolidated with Saint Pius the Something. Okay, that was the Food Fair. The first supermarket. The first time I was ever in air-conditioning. Food Fair.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen we get to Archmere Academy, his high school, we stop and admire the fence. \u0022I painted all this wrought iron. I really did. How I paid for tuition. Eighth-grade summer, ninth grade, tenth grade. We worked for a guy named Dominic. Dominic talked like this, \u0027Hey, Joe, get over here.\u0027 You think I\u0027m joking, but I\u0027m not.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe narrative is fast, tumbling, independent of audience reaction. He is talking to us, but he is talking to himself; with Biden the distinction is a mere technicality. We march through the campus as a group—Shailagh, Secret Service agents in rolling patterns, Biden\u0027s smile leading. As it happens, it\u0027s the last day of school at Archmere Academy, and no one knew the vice president of the United States was coming. Students, faculty, form a crowd around him in the courtyard, and Biden doesn\u0027t...transition. It\u0027s the same narrative, just a growing audience, his soft voice and mood rising. \u0022We played in that gym, that\u0027s how ancient I am. I used to weed that garden. Hey, how you doing? I\u0027m Joe Biden. I used to go to this school. That used to be more of a garden garden, now it\u0027s more open. This is the last day? Oh, you all look so stressed. Are you seniors? Well, good for you. That\u0027s the art building now? The art building! And by the way, when I came here, there were no girls.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe girls, maybe twenty of them, giggle, hold up their phones, and he pauses for pictures. He moves into the manor house, everyone following like fish swirling. \u0022And I washed every window in this building,\u0022 he says, reaching toward the stained-glass dome of the rotunda. \u0022Most of the summer. I swear to God. With water and vinegar and paper.\u0022 He spins, works all angles of the crowd. \u0022My kids went here. My oldest son, he\u0027s the attorney general of the state of Delaware. We have a rugby team now? I want a picture! Ho ho ho, where\u0027s the White House photographer? And where\u0027s the class president? Can I have a class-president picture? Kate? Hello, Kate! I was class president, too, Kate! Folks, folks—\u0022\u000A\u000AThe crowd obeys, falls to a hush. \u0022Folks, when I was here at Archmere,\u0022 he says, gathering attention. \u0022One of the reasons I owe so much to Archmere, and by the way, I\u0027m not joking. Don\u0027t laugh when I tell you how. You know, you never make fun of anybody with a club foot or a withered arm, but it\u0027s open season on anybody who stutters.\u000A\u000A\u0022I used to stutter really badly. Everybody thinks it\u0027s funny. And it\u0027s not funny. It\u0027s not.\u0022\u000A\u000AWithout looking, he reaches out to Kate, the class president, grabs her hand.\u000A\u000A\u0022The most frightened I was. The hardest speech I ever had to make my whole life was my senior year, and all I had to do was introduce my family. And I was scared to death. Just, even now, thinking about it. \u0027Father Diny, parents, guests, I\u0027d like to introduce to you my c—\u0027 And I almost couldn\u0027t say c-c-c-c—\u0022\u000A\u000AKate is short, in a pretty flowered dress. She has her eyebrows up, leans forward as if to help.\u000A\u000A\u0022C-c-c-c-class,\u0022 he says. \u0022Of 1961. It literally was one of the turning points of my life that I was able to stand there. And it was because of the priest and nuns here at Archmere.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe students have put their phones down. No one expected the vice president of the United States to come, no one expected a speech on the last day of school.\u000A\u000AHe turns to Kate, leans down, kisses her forehead.\u000A\u000A\u0022Anyway, I\u0027ll get out of your hair.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A\u0022He was, you know, made fun of,\u0022 says his sister, Valerie Biden Owens. \u0022One guy called him \u0027Dash,\u0027 signed the football to \u0027dash dash dash Biden,\u0027 because it was \u0027J-J-J-Joe Biden.\u0027 He worked hard. He practiced speaking. He learned cadence and rhythm. He memorized poems. He worked very hard.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AGame it out. That\u0027s what he taught himself. Like, collecting money for the paper route. The people who answer the door are going to talk to you, and you have to say something back. He learned their interests, rehearsed at home. The guy in the red house? A Yankees man. Know the box scores. Practice. \u0022Did you see Mantle hit two homers yesterday?\u0022 Memorize. Get the cadence. Did you see/Man-tle hit/two hom-ers/yes-ter-day. Practice.\u000A\u000AValerie was his best friend, constant companion, his kids\u0027 caretaker after Neilia, his first wife, died. Valerie ran his first campaign, his second, and every one after until he joined up with the Obama campaign. She remains his political alter ego. (\u0022I do like to call myself Vice Sister.\u0022) She can inhabit her brother\u0027s brain. She was there when those fools mocked him. \u0022My brother hates, hates, hates bullies,\u0022 she says. \u0022The man who pushed the girl. The guy who makes fun of you because you\u0027re fat.\u000A\u000A\u0022Joe never appeals to the lowest common denominator. Look what\u0027s happened in our political environment. If you don\u0027t agree with me, you\u0027re a bad person. You\u0027re immoral. You want to screw with me. You\u0027re bad, bad, bad. That\u0027s the climate. And Joe—never.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn those early campaign days, Biden and Val made it up as they went along. \u0022Joe is the first senator that he and I ever met,\u0022 she says. He was 28, not long out of law school (which was even more boring than college—he liked sports, he liked girls), and now he had a family, two boys, a baby girl on the way. He had become a county councilman more or less by accident, agreeing to help the party out. He became ignited by politics, got the idea to run for the U.S. Senate. It was 1971. Republican incumbent, J. Caleb Boggs, hadn\u0027t lost a race since 1946. Polls the summer before the election had Biden trailing by thirty points.\u000A\u000AAnd then he won.\u000A\u000A\u0022It was wild,\u0022 says former senator Ted Kaufman, who helped with the campaign and would go on to be a lifelong adviser. \u0022There is nothing I\u0027ll ever again believe is impossible.\u000A\u000A\u0022The big influx of new guys was \u002774. Gary Hart and Al Gore and all those guys. Joe Biden in \u002772 was the first of the new brand.\u0022 Biden ran on civil rights, health care, withdrawal from Vietnam, the environment. Flash forward to the 1990s, Biden mixing it up with Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond to pass the chemical-weapons treaty, the crime bill.\u000A\u000A\u0022Now, after the fiscal cliff, everybody says, \u0027Oh yeah, this is something this guy is good at,\u0027 \u0022 Kaufman says. \u0022But he\u0027s been doing that for years. For Joe, it all goes back to character—character coming from having really wonderful things happen to you, but also really awful things happen to you.\u0022\u000A\u000AKaufman remembers—everybody from back then remembers—when the call came. Just weeks after the miracle win over Boggs. A man couldn\u0027t soar any higher. Biden was in Washington, trying to figure out how to build a staff. Val was there. She took the call. Biden read her face. He knew every expression on his sister\u0027s face.\u000A\u000A\u0022She\u0027s dead, isn\u0027t she,\u0022 he said.\u000A\u000AA tractor trailer. His wife Neilia, dead. His baby Naomi, dead. Biden was sworn into the Senate in a hospital in Wilmington where his sons, Beau and Hunter, pulled from the wreckage, lay recovering.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A\u0022Reality has a way of intruding,\u0022 Biden said that day in the Cheney sunroom. \u0022Reality eventually intrudes on everything.\u0022 He didn\u0027t talk about the accident, any of that. That is not the way a man talks in Washington, D.C.\u000A\u000AThe leader of the free world. Now, there\u0027s an interesting topic. He said nowadays that job is way too complicated for one person alone to do, and so America is almost certainly better off with two. Obama and Joe. \u0022Ideologically simpatico.\u0022 That\u0027s the key. \u0022Not like Bush-Cheney, where Bush is sort of a blank slate and Cheney was his imprint. Cheney made it hard for the government to function coherently.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe leaned forward, took a sip from a dainty white coffee cup. \u0022Cheney\u0027s domain,\u0022 he said, gesturing in the direction of the stairs. \u0022Cheney had built up an entire apparatus. Sort of a separate National Security Council. I mean, up in the third floor, there\u0027s a room up there that is a secure—secure meaning it has a door you can lock—that\u0027s I\u0027m told where Scooter Libby worked out of. There was a separate room over here that I turned into a child\u0027s bedroom that had a steel door on it that was the equivalent of the vice president\u0027s situation room, where he would hook up, sit here, and participate in the situation-room meetings.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe job of vice president is important, really it is, way more important than it used to be, but not in that fucked-up way Cheney made it important. I got the feeling Biden would have loved to say \u0022fucked-up way Cheney made it important.\u0022 But he didn\u0027t say that, not with all the tape recorders going, and the staffers there, and him in his breakfast-with-the-king-of-Jordan blue suit. Still, the uneasy expectation that he might say something like that is the thing, always the thing with Biden, the guy who trips and falls, gets back up, gets taken out, keeps getting back in.\u000A\u000AHe will say foolish things he doesn\u0027t quite mean, and he will say bluntly brilliant things that others long to say. \u0022This is a big fucking deal,\u0022 he whispered to Obama, as the president was about to sign the health-insurance-reform bill into law. Of course it was. Thank you, Joe. \u0022Who do you love?\u0022 he said on Meet the Press. \u0022Who do you love? And will you be loyal to the person you love?... Whether they\u0027re marriages of lesbians or gay men or heterosexuals.\u0022 Of course. Thank you, Joe. He sparked the debate so many Americans wished Obama would have with that unscripted bit.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s his charm. It\u0027s his gift. It\u0027s his political liability, and it\u0027s part of an American conundrum. We beg for authenticity, and then when we get it, oh man, it\u0027s hilarious. Biden can be fantastic when he\u0027s on his game. At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, his speech got higher Nielsen ratings than either Bill Clinton\u0027s or Obama\u0027s. He killed the debate against Ryan, pumped air back into a campaign deflated after Obama\u0027s miserable first performance against Romney.\u000A\u000AWatching those performances, it\u0027s almost impossible to see him as a person once crippled by speech.\u000A\u000A\u0022Humiliating,\u0022 he said to me, when I asked about the stutter. \u0022Degrading. And by the way, everybody\u0027s experienced something like that—\u0022\u000A\u000ARelax, they said. Slow down, they said. Stop it, they said. Just say it.\u000A\u000AThen, that day in the Cheney sunroom, it started happening. \u0022W-w-w-when you t-t-t-talk like that—\u0022 he said. His face tilted. His eyebrows went up. Was it fake stuttering? Like back at the school? A demonstration? His chin appeared to lock in place, his lips nibbled without sound. The display was uncomfortably convincing. I wanted to check with the staff—does he do this often? Can he just call it up like this? But he had his eyes locked on mine. And looking away is exactly the thing anyone with any physical affliction is waiting for, waiting for you to flee, to prove that this is so grotesque you can\u0027t even look at it. \u000A\u000ANobody was fidgeting anymore. The room felt hot. \u0022You c-c-c-can\u0027t approach,\u0022 he said. \u0022W-w-w-would you go to the p-p-p-prom with me?\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AWe go to a cheesesteak place for lunch. He tells me what to get, tells Shailagh what to get. \u0022And you can both decide on your own toppings.\u0022 He folds the trash when he\u0027s finished his food, folds the paper lining and the napkin precisely before discarding.\u000A\u000AThere is one more place. Maybe two. We\u0027ll have to see. In the interest of time. \u0022No, you won\u0027t believe—\u0022 We climb back into the motorcade and go snaking through a heavily wooded neighborhood, old, tiny, colorful houses, narrow streets. \u0022Just go straight here if you would, please. Look at this house on the right. Eclectic. Little hobbit houses. Like they were built with fairy dust! You know? You see?\u000A\u000A\u0022Neilia,\u0022 he says. He and Neilia always wanted to buy a house here. Neilia, the first person outside of his family who believed in him. Neilia devised the strategy to help him not flunk out of law school. Neilia led him to see how huge his life could be. \u0022My wife Neilia... My deceased wife, Neilia.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Stop at this intersection, if you would. Dead-end street. So these guys may not want to go down here.\u0022\u000A\u000ASpider, hold, dead-end street. \u000A\u000AHe climbs out of the SUV, takes off toward the woods, finds a deer path, blazes in without flinching, swatting vines, spiderwebs. He\u0027s still got his plastic Coke cup from lunch, the straw sticking out. \u0022A step here. This used to be all clear here. My sister and I thought this was the enchanted forest.\u0022 There\u0027s mud, wet leaves. Shailagh\u0027s in her pointed heels. He\u0027s in his tassel loafers. He doesn\u0027t care, doesn\u0027t notice. He\u0027s chasing ghosts in Wilmington, and there might be some more back here.\u000A\u000AWe get to the stream, wide, meandering around a jumble of boulders under the canopy of hardwoods, the sun piercing in patterns. It\u0027s picture-perfect, nothing to worry about but bugs. \u0022Can you believe this?\u0022 he says, lifting his arms as if to say \u0022Ta-dah!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Like a year-round summer camp, sir,\u0022 John says.\u000A\u000A\u0022It was!\u0022 Biden says. \u0022This used to be the dam, right here. It\u0027s all filled in now. You\u0027re looking at the pool, but it was four times as wide. You could dive off. The edge, it went all the way out here, you follow me? That\u0027s how wide it was! You follow me? It was that far over. Where these trees are? The most magical place in the world! Can you imagine? You\u0027re 13 years old? It was a fairy tale!\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s childhood, it\u0027s America, it\u0027s campaigning, it\u0027s family, it\u0027s all the same to him, one solid amalgam.\u000A\u000A\u0022And by the way, Dr. Heinz, 300 pounds, he used to lie out there with his belly and just float. No raft, nothing. He would just float!\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A\u0022What should I say about you that people don\u0027t know?\u0022 I ask him.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a foolish question, especially for Joe Biden, the guy who is about a Hillary Clinton away from the White House. He\u0027s just Joe. What you see is what you get.\u000A\u000ABut that is not what he says. Nor does he go charging athletically forth with a muscular show of words. It\u0027s the one time he answers with long stretches of silence.\u000A\u000A\u0022My entire career,\u0022 he says. \u0022I have never, ever, ever... Like the joke with Barack. Well, not a joke. But to make the point: When he offered me the job, I said, \u0027I\u0027m not wearing any funny hats.\u0027\u0022\u000A\u000AHe doesn\u0027t wear funny hats. He is not the guy with the lampshade on his head. Listen, folks, he has no desire to put a fucking lampshade on his head. He is not that guy.\u000A\u000A\u0022People make jokes,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s about ideas,\u0022 he says, then stops himself. He\u0027s holding his aviators, twirling. It goes awkwardly on like this.\u000A\u000A\u0022I have read as much or know as much about foreign policy, domestic policy,\u0022 he says. \u0022Remember all that talk about the debate? How the other guy\u0022—Paul Ryan—\u0022was supposed to be the numbers guy and knew all the detail? Remember? Listen, I look forward to those kinds of things—\u0022\u000A\u000AHe falls silent again. We pass a basketball court, kids playing.\u000A\u000A\u0022I never speak about anything I don\u0027t know a great deal about,\u0022 he says. \u0022That I haven\u0027t worked like hell for. But that\u0027s not what you\u0027d expect. You might expect Clinton to do that.... Well, I shouldn\u0027t. I\u0027m getting—\u0022 He looks out the window. He is not going to do this. He is not going to stoop or beg for respect.\u000A\u000AI think about a speech Biden once gave, and about what it must feel like to live a life in which so many people don\u0027t get you, not really, fools keep mocking you, and you just get your nose back in your work. The speech was to a convention of the National Stuttering Association, and he was talking about how insidious the affliction is. \u0022Insidious,\u0022 he said. He talked about never believing the people who think they have you figured out. Never believing them—that was the good fight. \u0022The rationales other people apply as to why we stutter,\u0022 he said. \u0022We\u0027re slow. We don\u0027t have confidence. We don\u0027t have any strength. We\u0027re just not very bright.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis again is the thing. The thing that has plagued him his whole life, the thing that keeps the presidency out of reach, this again and again is the thing. Vice fucking president of the United States, sitting here twirling his glasses, having to defend the depth of his own intellect.\u000A\u000A\u0022I hope I\u0027m not overstepping my bounds here,\u0022 says John, in the front seat. It\u0027s the first time he\u0027s stepped in like this. It feels like a rescue, a guy taking a bullet. Lay off my boss. \u0022Quick little story. We stopped at Dunkin\u0027 Donuts. A man comes up. \u0027Joe, you gotta come see my wife, she\u0027s really ill.\u0027 A small little house there. Hospital bed in the living room, her deathbed. No air-conditioning. And the vice president told a staff person, \u0027Hey, let\u0027s make sure we get an A/C unit here.\u0027 I was like, wow. That\u0027s Vice President Joe Biden.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s nice of you to say, Johnny,\u0022 Biden says to him, even though the story is sort of off-topic. \u0022And by the way, we bought her some doughnuts.\u0022\u000A\u000AI ask him what he meant when he said it\u0027s about \u0022ideas,\u0022 and he gives it one last go.\u000A\u000A\u0022There\u0027s a sense that there\u0027s an inconsistency in being able to relate to people personally and being...innovative,\u0022 he says. \u0022Being very...substantively informed. Put it that way.\u0022 He throws his head back with a tiny laugh of surrender. \u0022Ha.\u0022 He is not going to do this.\u000A\u000AYou can\u0027t be a compassionate man, a guy without a mean bone in his body, and also a brilliant man. The public doesn\u0027t have room for that—at least not in Joe Biden. He mentions a famous world leader. He won\u0027t say who, but it could have been any number of leaders from any number of countries across the globe—Karzai, Medvedev, Netanyahu—a moment, one of a million moments in a political career spanning four decades. \u0022We were trying to get a world leader to refrain from doing something. He came to Washington, and it was a big deal. Most people thought that if he had done what he was going to do, it would have caused a war to break out.\u0022 Send in Joe Biden. Arm around the world leader. Talk to the world leader. Soft voice, a few easy laughs, show some Joe Biden empathy to the world leader. \u0022And I convinced him to forgo it and do something else,\u0022 he says. No big deal. It\u0027s what he does. Save a country or two from some miserable war. To the extent that all politics is personal, Joe Biden is the historic monument. \u0022And I walked out, and a guy was there, a senior staff guy at the State Department, and he said, \u0027You know, Mr. Vice President, you didn\u0027t realize it, but that was diplomacy!\u0027\u0022\u000A\u000AHe looks at me, straightens his back, offers an unmistakable WTF blink.\u000A\u000A\u0022There\u0027s this thing, you know?\u0022\u000A\u000AJeanne Marie Laskas is a GQ correspondent.",

We&apos;ve been at this for hours, climbing  in and out of the SUV to look at stuff, a water tower,  a stone wall, the house where the most beautiful girl  in the world lived, hoagies, Herman the German&apos;s  gas station, Meyers-eats-tires tire shop, the house where another most beautiful girl in the world lived, and he&apos;s holding up better than the rest of us. He never winces,  has no achy knees, no lower-back anything, neck, joints; for the guy rockin&apos; the Ray-Ban  aviators, 70 is the new 60. &quot;Wait, there&apos;s Little Italy down there,&quot; he says, peering out the window. &quot;A lot of great Italian restaurants. If there&apos;s anybody down there who doesn&apos;t vote for me, I haven&apos;t found them yet. But I will. I will.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1">&quot;Okay, in the interest of time, we&apos;ll stop here. Let&apos;s get out here.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2">It&apos;s his old street. His house. Small white brick. Black shutters. Cement path. A perfectly average 1950s American neighborhood in Wilmington, Delaware, now with a motorcade parked along Wilson Road and Secret Service guys swarming and the vice president of the United States wandering, leading fast. &quot;Hi there,&quot; he says to a guy with a leaf blower. &quot;I lived here for twenty years. Mack? Hey, Mack. I&apos;m Joe. You&apos;re living in a house a guy named Kenny Horn used to live in. Kenny Horn.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.3">&quot;Okay, the driveway, watch yourself. So this is the house. That was my bedroom. I lived there with my brothers Jimmy, Frankie, and my Uncle Ed. One bureau, four drawers, everybody got a drawer. My sister, the princess Valerie, had her own room. Which was ten by twelve. But she deserved it. And my dad took great pride in having that barbecue pit.&quot; He circles  the house, heads to the back door. &quot;I wish  I knew who lived here, because I would show you my room.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.5">Uncle Ed, they called him Uncle Boo-Boo. Brilliant guy. Sprawling intellect.  He stuttered. Way worse than Biden stuttered as a boy, which was bad enough. Uncle Boo-Boo never got past it. Never married. Dud job. Drank. Drank a lot. He served as an example of what could happen if you didn&apos;t rehearse, didn&apos;t practice getting your mouth unstuck. Biden has never had a drink.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.6">&quot;Oh, what the hell.&quot; He charges up to the back door, knocks. &quot;Hello? Hello?&quot; We stand on the back deck, waiting. Two Secret Service guys have their backs to us, stationed like owls by the picket fence.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.7">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.8">&quot;He wants to be the best vice president ever,&quot; staffers told me, months ago, when I first started spending time with Joe Biden. That was all the talk last winter. Hillary would almost certainly be the nominee, not Biden, they said, whenever the 2016 issue came up, which wasn&apos;t often. But then, abruptly, Biden&apos;s stock started steeply rising, at least in the eyes of the public. Washington had been hyperventilating about the fiscal cliff, and Obama sent Biden in to broker a deal. Then came the killings in Newtown, Connecticut, and Obama sent Biden out to rally the public, Biden in to reason with Congress,  Biden over to talk to the NRA. In 2013, Biden has emerged increasingly more visibly potent than his boss. THE MOST INFLUENTIAL VICE PRESIDENT IN HISTORY? one headline proffered.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.9">&quot;Well, he would be crazy not to keep his options open,&quot; staffers started saying then, whenever the 2016 issue came up. Which still wasn&apos;t often. The parlor game was not my reason for being there. I wanted to get to know Biden. I wanted to understand why &quot;President Joe Biden&quot; has such a  preposterous ring to it, and I wanted to know if he knew it did.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.a">There&apos;s a joke. Something fundamentally comical. That&apos;s where the public starts with Biden. I recognized it in Rome, when I traveled with him to the pope&apos;s inauguration. He was meeting with friends, presidents from across the globe. Because Joe Biden has been at this so long, don&apos;t forget, that he is the stuff of middle-school civics exams. I saw him freelance a grand Joe Biden entrance into President Giorgio Napolitano&apos;s palace, teeth gleaming, arms fully outstretched, ready to hug this guy, that guy, <em>Hey, guys! I&apos;m here! You&apos;re here! We&apos;re beautiful!</em> Decked out in his smooth blue suit, white pocket square&#x2014;his broad smile the kind a man reserves for his bowling team. This demeanor contrasted sharply with everyone else&apos;s. Guards in shiny helmets sprouting horsehair ponytails, bedraggled White House advance team in smart skirts and solid-color pumps. A Biden entrance can make the stuffiest event intimate, for an instant human  and vaguely...funny.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.b">Sunshine, apt and miraculous, broke through the day of the pope&apos;s installation Mass. &quot;Your Holiness, this is my sister, Valerie,&quot; Biden said. The pope. Joe Biden and the pope. Val was next to him in her long black chapel veil, the two of them together at church just like back in Wilmington, and Scranton before. Except it was the Vatican. In the reception line, Val didn&apos;t kiss the pope&apos;s ring, and Biden didn&apos;t kiss the pope&apos;s ring (to be fair, plenty of people didn&apos;t kiss the pope&apos;s ring), because they are Bidens, equal, not below or above anyone, not the pope, not some schlub on the street. &quot;Nobody is better than you.&quot; That&apos;s the message their mom hammered into their heads. &quot;You&apos;re not better than anybody, but nobody is better than you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.c">JOE BIDEN DOESN&apos;T KISS UP TO ANYONE, international headlines read later that day, which made it sound way more hostile than his mom ever meant it.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.d">Then an image was tweeted, and for a time retweeted, a picture of Biden in the crowd of worshippers outside Saint Peter&apos;s Basilica during the holiest Mass of the twenty-first century. The photo is jammed with faces, Biden in the center of them  all. Plenty have on sunglasses. But Biden has on his signature Ray-Bans&#x2014;the aviators!&#x2014;and that was what, above all else about his whirlwind trip to Rome, was inexplicably spectacular.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.e"><em>Vice fucking president of the United States</em>. You get the feeling Joe Biden would love to put it that way, to stand in a crowd of thousands in his aviators and say, &quot;Yo, I&apos;m the vice fucking president of the United States, y&apos;all.&quot; Which he has never said. But you think he might. That&apos;s what&apos;s funny. It&apos;s a comfort level, and a mocking, and a kind of affection wrapped warmly into a knowing joke. Joe Biden. The tipsy uncle who actually doesn&apos;t drink. He&apos;s always dancing there on the edge of embarrassment. He&apos;s that guy. He might put a lampshade on his head.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.f">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.g">It&apos;s odd, probably, that the vice president of the United States is wandering around like this, trying to get in the room he slept in when he was 10. But here we are. &quot;You can see the old porch, Shailagh, see it?&quot; Shailagh Murray is his communications director, a former <em>Washington Post</em> political reporter&#x2014;she&apos;s Irish, she&apos;s Catholic, she gets him, he loves her. &quot;This deck wasn&apos;t here,&quot; he says. &quot;Oh, I used to come out here and put pebbles in my mouth, try to shout against that wall.

And, you know, we&apos;ll see where  the hell I am.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.17">&quot;And by the way, if you come in the office, I have two portraits hanging&#x2014;one of Jefferson, one of Adams.

Joe Biden does not pause. Points inside parentheticals, ideas emphatically chased. It&apos;s not that he fills up air like Romney might, or even tries to make a sale like Clinton. Biden&apos;s loquaciousness is more open than that. <em>It&apos;s an athletic event</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.19">&quot;And I said, &apos;Why do you want me to be vice president?&apos; &quot; he told me, explaining that he never wanted the VP job, really he didn&apos;t, but Obama convinced him. &quot;He said, &apos;Help me govern. Joe, you do Iraq. Defense, State&#x2014;talk to Joe, get it done. Recovery Act, almost a trillion dollars, <em>do it, Joe!</em>&apos;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1a">&quot;Not that I&apos;m so special,&quot; he went on, &quot;or that he couldn&apos;t do it as well or better. But guess what, there was a war in Afghanistan going on at the same time, a banking system collapsing. It was a boulder rolling down a hill here. No matter who he was, now matter how brilliant&#x2014;this guy is <em>brilliant</em>&#x2014;he doesn&apos;t have the space on his desk to pick up all of those pieces.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1b">Co-captains, that&apos;s how he described his working relationship with Obama. Theirs is by all accounts a conjoined administration. At seven forty every morning, Obama&apos;s top advisers gather to set the day&apos;s agenda&#x2014;together with other senior staff and Biden&apos;s top advisers, a blended, tangled family tree. Obama&apos;s press secretary used to be Biden&apos;s communications director. Biden&apos;s strategist is the brother of Obama&apos;s former national-security adviser; Biden&apos;s chief of staff co-authored a book with Obama&apos;s former chief of staff.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1c">Ron Klain was Biden&apos;s chief of staff during his first term, and he saw how Biden changed up the job description compared with Al Gore, for whom Klain had also served as chief of staff. &quot;From day one,&quot; Klain says, &quot;Al Gore planned on running for president. The project was to ready him. If the president was doing a public event, he was going to stand behind the president whether he had a role or not.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1d">&quot;Biden didn&apos;t have any interest in that. That was not the model he wanted. He put his political capital on helping Obama succeed. He wanted projects. Beginning, middle, and end projects.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1e">The deal has worked for Biden, and the deal has also worked for Obama. They round each other out. Biden can say <em>malarkey</em>. Biden can hug, literally, Republicans. &quot;Joe Biden doesn&apos;t have a mean bone in his body,&quot; says John McCain. &quot;He&apos;s unique from the day he was elected before he was 30 years old. He&apos;s unique in that he&apos;s had some role in every major national-security crisis that his nation has faced in the last thirty-five years. I don&apos;t know anyone like him in the U.S. Senate. Look at the number of times he&apos;s been able to conclude agreements. I would say he&apos;s been the most impactful vice president that I&apos;ve known&#x2014;certainly in modern times.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1f">Not Cheney, McCain says. Biden.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1g">&quot;President Biden&quot; does not sound preposterous to McCain. &quot;Suppose the economy comes on strong. He&apos;s bound to get credit.... Of course, the State of the Union speech would be the longest in history.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1h">Chuck Hagel is one of Biden&apos;s best friends. John Kerry is one of Biden&apos;s best friends. Lindsey Graham is almost one of Biden&apos;s best friends. &quot;He&apos;s got a set of balls,&quot; Michael Bloomberg said of Biden, and if they spend any more time together, they will definitely become best friends. And then there is his roster of palace pals around the world. It would take a lifetime for someone to build an infrastructure of so much trust, so many avenues, in so many corners of the world. When an old man dies, the saying goes, a library burns to the ground. For Biden, it would be an entire global network.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1i">In Wilmington, the guy driving the SUV in front of us stops abruptly, curls into a U-turn. &quot;Ha!&quot; Biden says. &quot;This guy is so gosh darn bad. I love him, but he&apos;s gonna get us killed.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1j">&quot;Okay, take a left, keep going. This is what they call Holy Rosary. Where the bingo sign is? The carnival sign? Now it&apos;s closed down. It was consolidated with Saint Pius the Something. Okay, that was the Food Fair. The first supermarket. The first time I was ever in air-conditioning. Food Fair.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1k">When we get to Archmere Academy, his high school, we stop and admire the fence. &quot;I painted all this wrought iron. I really did. How I paid for tuition. Eighth-grade summer, ninth grade, tenth grade. We worked for a guy named Dominic. Dominic talked like this, &apos;<em>Hey, Joe, get over here</em>.&apos; You think I&apos;m joking, but I&apos;m not.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1l">The narrative is fast, tumbling, independent of audience reaction. He is talking to us, but he is talking to himself; with Biden the distinction is a mere technicality. We march through the campus as a group&#x2014;Shailagh, Secret Service agents in rolling patterns, Biden&apos;s smile leading. As it happens, it&apos;s the last day of school at Archmere Academy, and no one knew the vice president of the United States was coming. Students, faculty, form a crowd around him in the courtyard, and Biden doesn&apos;t...transition. It&apos;s the same narrative, just a growing audience, his soft voice and mood rising. &quot;We played in <em>that</em> gym, that&apos;s how ancient I am. I used to weed <em>that</em> garden. Hey, how you doing? I&apos;m Joe Biden. I used to go to this school. That used to be more of a <em>garden</em> garden, now it&apos;s more open. This is the last day? Oh, you all look so stressed. Are you seniors? Well, good for you. That&apos;s the art building now? The art building! And by the way, when I came here, there were no girls.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1m">The girls, maybe twenty of them, giggle, hold up their phones, and he pauses for pictures. He moves into the manor house, everyone following like fish swirling. &quot;And I washed every window in this building,&quot; he says, reaching toward the stained-glass dome of the rotunda. &quot;Most of the summer. I swear to God. With water and vinegar and paper.&quot; He spins, works all angles of the crowd. &quot;My kids went here. My oldest son, he&apos;s the attorney general of the state of Delaware. We have a rugby team now? I want a picture! Ho ho ho, where&apos;s the White House photographer? And where&apos;s the class president? Can I have a class-president picture? Kate? Hello, Kate! I was class president, too, Kate! Folks, folks&#x2014;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1n">The crowd obeys, falls to a hush. &quot;Folks, when I was here at Archmere,&quot; he says, gathering attention. &quot;One of the reasons I owe so much to Archmere, and by the way, I&apos;m not joking. Don&apos;t laugh when I tell you how. You know, you never make fun of anybody with a club foot or a withered arm, but it&apos;s open season on anybody who stutters.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.1o">&quot;I used to stutter really badly.

The hardest speech I ever had to make my whole life was my senior year, and all I had to do was introduce my family. And I was scared to death.

Valerie ran his first campaign, his second, and every one after until he joined up with the Obama campaign. She remains his political alter ego. (&quot;I do like to call myself Vice Sister.&quot;) She can inhabit her brother&apos;s brain.

And Joe&#x2014;never.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.22">In those early campaign days, Biden and Val made it up as they went along. &quot;Joe is the first senator that he and I ever met,&quot; she says. He was 28, not long out of law school (which was even more boring than college&#x2014;he liked sports, he liked girls), and now he had a family, two boys, a baby girl on the way. He had become a county councilman more or less by accident, agreeing to help the party out. He became ignited by politics, got the idea to run for the U.S. Senate. It was 1971. Republican incumbent, J. Caleb Boggs, hadn&apos;t lost a race <em>since 1946</em>. Polls the summer before the election had Biden trailing by thirty points.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.23">And then he won.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.24">&quot;It was wild,&quot; says former senator Ted Kaufman, who helped with the campaign and would go on to be a lifelong adviser. &quot;There is nothing I&apos;ll ever again believe is impossible.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.25">&quot;The big influx of new guys was &apos;74. Gary Hart and Al Gore and all those guys. Joe Biden in &apos;72 was the first of the new brand.&quot; Biden ran on civil rights, health care, withdrawal from Vietnam, the environment. Flash forward to the 1990s, Biden mixing it up with Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond to pass the chemical-weapons treaty, the crime bill.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.26">&quot;Now, after the fiscal cliff, everybody says, &apos;Oh yeah, this is something this guy is good at,&apos; &quot; Kaufman says. &quot;But he&apos;s been doing that for years. For Joe, it all goes back to character&#x2014;character coming from having really wonderful things happen to you, but also really awful things happen to you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.27">Kaufman remembers&#x2014;everybody from back then remembers&#x2014;when the call came. Just weeks after the miracle win over Boggs. A man couldn&apos;t soar any higher. Biden was in Washington, trying to figure out how to build a staff. Val was there. She took the call. Biden read her face. He knew every expression on his sister&apos;s face.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.28">&quot;She&apos;s dead, isn&apos;t she,&quot; he said.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.29">A tractor trailer. His wife Neilia, dead. His baby Naomi, dead. Biden was sworn into the Senate in a hospital in Wilmington where his sons, Beau and Hunter, pulled from the wreckage, lay recovering.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2a">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2b">&quot;Reality has a way of intruding,&quot; Biden said that day in the Cheney sunroom. &quot;Reality eventually intrudes on everything.&quot; He didn&apos;t talk about the accident, any of that. That is not the way a man talks in Washington, D.C.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2c">The leader of the free world. Now, there&apos;s an interesting topic. He said nowadays that job is way too complicated for one person alone to do, and so America is almost certainly better off with two. Obama and Joe. &quot;Ideologically simpatico.&quot; That&apos;s the key. &quot;Not like Bush-Cheney, where Bush is sort of a blank slate and Cheney was his imprint. Cheney made it hard for the government to function coherently.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2d">He leaned forward, took a sip from a dainty white coffee cup. &quot;Cheney&apos;s domain,&quot; he said, gesturing in the direction of the stairs. &quot;Cheney had built up an entire apparatus. Sort of a separate National Security Council. I mean, up in the third floor, there&apos;s a room up there that is a secure&#x2014;secure meaning it has a door you can lock&#x2014;that&apos;s I&apos;m told where Scooter Libby worked out of. There was a separate room over here that I turned into a child&apos;s bedroom that had a steel door on it that was the equivalent of the vice president&apos;s situation room, where he would hook up, sit here, and participate in the situation-room meetings.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2e">The job of vice president is important, really it is, way more important than it used to be, but not in that fucked-up way Cheney made it important. I got the feeling Biden would have loved to say &quot;fucked-up way Cheney made it important.&quot; But he didn&apos;t say that, not with all the tape recorders going, and the staffers there, and him in his breakfast-with-the-king-of-Jordan blue suit. Still, the uneasy expectation that he might say something like that is the thing, always the thing with Biden, the guy who trips and falls, gets back up, gets taken out, keeps getting back in.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2f">He will say foolish things he doesn&apos;t quite mean, and he will say bluntly brilliant things that others long to say. &quot;This is a big fucking deal,&quot; he whispered to Obama, as the president was about to sign the health-insurance-reform bill into law. Of course it was. Thank you, Joe. &quot;Who do you love?&quot; he said on <em>Meet the Press</em>. &quot;Who do you love? And will you be loyal to the person you love?... Whether they&apos;re marriages of lesbians or gay men or heterosexuals.&quot; Of course. Thank you, Joe. He sparked the debate so many Americans wished Obama would have with that unscripted bit.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2g">It&apos;s his charm. It&apos;s his gift. It&apos;s his political liability, and it&apos;s part of an American conundrum. We beg for authenticity, and then when we get it, oh man, it&apos;s hilarious. Biden can be fantastic when he&apos;s on his game. At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, his speech got higher Nielsen ratings than either Bill Clinton&apos;s or Obama&apos;s. He killed the debate against Ryan, pumped air back into a campaign deflated after Obama&apos;s miserable first performance against Romney.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2h">Watching those performances, it&apos;s almost impossible to see him as a person once crippled by speech.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2i">&quot;Humiliating,&quot; he said to me, when I asked about the stutter. &quot;Degrading. And by the way, everybody&apos;s experienced something like that&#x2014;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2j">Relax, they said. Slow down, they said. Stop it, they said. <em>Just say it</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2k">Then, that day in the Cheney sunroom, it started happening. &quot;W-w-w-when you t-t-t-talk like that&#x2014;&quot; he said. His face tilted. His eyebrows went up. Was it fake stuttering? Like back at the school? A demonstration? His chin appeared to lock in place, his lips nibbled without sound. The display was uncomfortably convincing. I wanted to check with the staff&#x2014;does he do this often? Can he just call it up like this? But he had his eyes locked on mine. And looking away is exactly the thing anyone with any physical affliction is waiting for, waiting for you to flee, <em>to prove that this is so grotesque you can&apos;t even look at it. </em></p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2l">Nobody was fidgeting anymore. The room felt hot. &quot;You c-c-c-can&apos;t approach,&quot; he said. &quot;W-w-w-would you go to the p-p-p-prom with me?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2m">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2n">We go to a cheesesteak place for lunch. He tells me what to get, tells Shailagh what to get. &quot;And you can both decide on your own toppings.&quot; He folds the trash when he&apos;s finished his food, folds the paper lining and the napkin precisely before discarding.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2o">There is one more place. Maybe two. We&apos;ll have to see. In the interest of time. &quot;No, you won&apos;t believe&#x2014;&quot; We climb back into the motorcade and go snaking through a heavily wooded neighborhood, old, tiny, colorful houses, narrow streets. &quot;Just go straight here if you would, please.

He and Neilia always wanted to buy a house here. Neilia, the first person outside of his family who believed in him. Neilia devised the strategy to help him not flunk out of law school. Neilia led him to see how huge his life could be. &quot;My wife Neilia... My deceased wife, Neilia.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2q">&quot;Stop at this intersection, if you would. Dead-end street.

He&apos;s still got his plastic Coke cup from lunch, the straw sticking out. &quot;A step here. This used to be all clear here. My sister and I thought this was the enchanted forest.&quot; There&apos;s mud, wet leaves. Shailagh&apos;s in her pointed heels. He&apos;s in his tassel loafers. He doesn&apos;t care, doesn&apos;t notice. He&apos;s chasing ghosts in Wilmington, and there might be some more back here.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2t">We get to the stream, wide, meandering around a jumble of boulders under the canopy of hardwoods, the sun piercing in patterns. It&apos;s picture-perfect, nothing to worry about but bugs. &quot;Can you believe this?&quot; he says, lifting his arms as if to say &quot;Ta-dah!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2u">&quot;Like a year-round summer camp, sir,&quot; John says.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.2v">&quot;It was!&quot; Biden says. &quot;This used to be the dam, right here. It&apos;s all filled in now. You&apos;re looking at the pool, but it was four times as wide. You could dive off. The edge, it went all the way out here, you follow me? That&apos;s how wide it was!

He&apos;s just Joe. What you see is what you get.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.31">But that is not what he says. Nor does he go charging athletically forth with a muscular show of words. It&apos;s the one time he answers with long stretches of silence.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.32">&quot;My entire career,&quot; he says. &quot;I have never, ever, ever... Like the joke with Barack. Well, not a joke.

He is not the guy with the lampshade on his head.

He&apos;s holding his aviators, twirling. It goes awkwardly on like this.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.36">&quot;I have read as much or know as much about foreign policy, domestic policy,&quot; he says. &quot;Remember all that talk about the debate? How the <em>other</em> guy&quot;&#x2014;Paul Ryan&#x2014;&quot;was supposed to be the numbers guy and knew all the detail? Remember? Listen, I look forward to those kinds of things&#x2014;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.37">He falls silent again. We pass a basketball court, kids playing.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.38">&quot;I never speak about anything I don&apos;t know a great deal about,&quot; he says. &quot;That I haven&apos;t worked like hell for. But that&apos;s not what you&apos;d expect. You might expect Clinton to do that.... Well, I shouldn&apos;t. I&apos;m getting&#x2014;&quot; He looks out the window. He is not going to do this. He is not going to stoop or beg for respect.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.39">I think about a speech Biden once gave, and about what it must feel like to live a life in which so many people don&apos;t get you, not really, fools keep mocking you, and you just get your nose back in your work. The speech was to a convention of the National Stuttering Association, and he was talking about how insidious the affliction is. &quot;Insidious,&quot; he said. He talked about never believing the people who think they have you figured out. Never believing them&#x2014;that was the good fight. &quot;The rationales other people apply as to why we stutter,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;re slow. We don&apos;t have confidence. We don&apos;t have any strength. We&apos;re just not very bright.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.3a">This again is the thing. The thing that has plagued him his whole life, the thing that keeps the presidency out of reach, this again and again is the thing.

It&apos;s the first time he&apos;s stepped in like this. It feels like a rescue, a guy taking a bullet. <em>Lay off my boss</em>. &quot;Quick little story. We stopped at Dunkin&apos; Donuts. A man comes up. &apos;Joe, you gotta come see my wife, she&apos;s really ill.&apos; A small little house there. Hospital bed in the living room, her deathbed. No air-conditioning. And the vice president told a staff person, &apos;Hey, let&apos;s make sure we get an A/C unit here.&apos; I was like, wow. That&apos;s Vice President Joe Biden.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.3c">&quot;That&apos;s nice of you to say, Johnny,&quot; Biden says to him, even though the story is sort of off-topic. &quot;And by the way, we bought her some doughnuts.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.3d">I ask him what he meant when he said it&apos;s about &quot;ideas,&quot; and he gives it one last go.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.3e">&quot;There&apos;s a sense that there&apos;s an inconsistency in being able to relate to people personally and being...innovative,&quot; he says. &quot;Being very...substantively informed. Put it that way.&quot; He throws his head back with a tiny laugh of surrender. &quot;Ha.&quot; He is not going to do this.</p><p data-reactid=".12j6thc35s.1.1.0.0.4.3f">You can&apos;t be a compassionate man, a guy without a mean bone in his body, and also a brilliant man. The public doesn&apos;t have room for that&#x2014;at least not in Joe Biden. He mentions a famous world leader. He won&apos;t say who, but it could have been any number of leaders from any number of countries across the globe&#x2014;Karzai, Medvedev, Netanyahu&#x2014;a moment, one of a million moments in a political career spanning four decades. &quot;We were trying to get a world leader to refrain from doing something. He came to Washington, and it was a big deal. Most people thought that if he had done what he was going to do, it would have caused a war to break out.&quot; Send in Joe Biden. Arm around the world leader. Talk to the world leader. Soft voice, a few easy laughs, show some Joe Biden empathy to the world leader. &quot;And I convinced him to forgo it and do something else,&quot; he says. No big deal. It&apos;s what he does. Save a country or two from some miserable war. To the extent that all politics is personal, Joe Biden is the historic monument. &quot;And I walked out, and a guy was there, a senior staff guy at the State Department, and he said, &apos;You know,
