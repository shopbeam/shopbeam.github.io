  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AOwning and designing one of the most undeniable denim brands in the industry for 27 years seems like it would come with a lot of pressure, right? Requiring lot of rigorous study and careful calculation to remain ahead of the curve, relevant, and profitable? Actually, for Jean Touitou, founder and owner of A.P.C., it\u0027s not that big of a deal. Call it arrogance, but Touitou believes that A.P.C. does the denim thing, from fit to fabric to price, better than anyone in the world, and he doesn\u0027t care what the rest of the business is doing. You can\u0027t really blame him for being so confident in his product. Countless men have first discovered the joys and thigh-chafes that come with slowly breaking in their first pair of selvedge jeans while wearing A.P.C. That\u0027s why the brand\u0027s product is sometimes even referred to as \u0022The Gateway Denim.\u0022\u000A\u000AStubborn as he may be, Touitou is still evolving. A.P.C. recently introduced stretch denim, which many raw denim fanatics consider heretical, but is simply indicative of Touitou\u0027s changing attitudes. The renowned minimalist even said during his most recent men\u0027s presentation in Paris that he\u0027s \u0022done with minimalism,\u0022 though he finds it difficult, as many do, to explain the je ne sais quoi that makes simplicity beautiful. Here we talk to the always brutally candid Touitou about A.P.C.\u0027s success, why they introduced stretch denim, what he thinks about being called normcore, and just how often the man who started it all washes his own New Standards.\u000A\u000A ···\u000A\u000AHow has the denim industry changed since you founded A.P.C. in 1987?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t look at the denim industry. It\u0027s not interesting to me.\u000A\u000A You don\u0027t look at what any other brands are doing at all?\u000A\u000A No. No, because that is not interesting to me. If I were a customer, I would do a survey about the brands that are out there. Why should I look at that if I am doing it myself? A baker makes his own bread. He doesn\u0027t go to the other bakeries for bread.\u000A\u000A Don\u0027t you want to know how other people are trying to do denim better than you?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t want to know how other people are trying to knock me off. That\u0027s a bit disturbing. But I don\u0027t give a fuck. I don\u0027t care. There\u0027s nothing that could make me jealous. Sometimes if there are good jeans I see, the price is not correct. I believe you not only need a good cut and good fabric, but the price has to be human. Otherwise, I could do tons of incredible things. But if the price is not human, the mission is not accomplished. The same thing goes for bags for women. Anybody with a regular amount of talent can do a beautiful dress. Okay, maybe not anybody, let\u0027s say 100 people on the planet. But if these dresses are three or four thousand dollars, it\u0027s only going to be possible to buy for a very small elite of the world. Frankly, even if I have the means to buy a pair of jeans for $1000 dollars, I wouldn\u0027t do so, because nothing about that is appealing to me.\u000A\u000A Do you think in general jean prices have gotten more expensive?\u000A\u000A Well, yes, because denim is a goldmine. But also because at least one or two days a week now, a gentleman will wear jeans. It\u0027s impossible for a brand to exist without jeans now. But there are too many signs on them now. People want to put their own signature on them now. Ours have no signature, except their quality.\u000A\u000A Even at school, kids, who are maybe 13 or 14, they can tell the difference between A.P.C. and something else. These other companies don\u0027t invest the same amount of money and time into the fabric, so it just falls apart. So even for babies, it\u0027s easy to see that when it\u0027s not the real thing, it\u0027s not the real thing.\u000A\u000A What are the things you do that separate you from other brands?\u000A\u000A It\u0027s the cut and quality of the fabric. Nobody can compete. There is nowhere else that people can find this denim. Also, this fabric has a special recipe that has been put together by me and the weavers back in the day in Japan. The weaver is a real samurai, and he doesn\u0027t give the secret to anybody. He has a long line of people who ask, \u0022Can we have the A.P.C. fabric?\u0022 and he will answer, \u0022No! I gave them my word!\u0022 There is something secret in our fabric that nobody knows. Even I try to forget the secret so I\u0027m not tempted to reveal it to anyone.\u000A\u000A When you first started A.P.C., what were the first jeans you introduced?\u000A\u000A The first pair we introduced was made with basically the same fabrics we are using today. Since then we\u0027ve been introducing new fabrics. Not too long ago, we introduced denim with stretch, black denim, white, but the fundamental denim is the same and has been the same recipe for 27 years.\u000A\u000A What made you want to introduce stretch denim into the collection?\u000A\u000A Well, I needed more comfort for myself maybe. In the past, stretch denim hasn\u0027t been so good and I think the stretch we do ads comfort. I\u0027m not a militant of the tiny pants trend for men. Also, the stretch denim falls nicely.\u000A\u000A How do you feel when you see people in A.P.C. jeans that they\u0027ve had for years and years?\u000A\u000A I couldn\u0027t say the contrary, obviously. I\u0027m not going to say, \u0022Oh that sucks that the jeans have been successful.\u0022 I\u0027m happy when I see that, yes.\u000A\u000A How often do you get a new pair of A.P.C. jeans?\u000A\u000A You know, lately I\u0027m trying to avoid wearing jeans. I prefer to wear sarongs, or a piece of fabric around my hips.\u000A\u000A Do you wear the sarong outside?\u000A\u000A No, because I live in a very conservative place called France. They call themselves revolutionaries but they are extremely conservative. But I wear them in the office with my staff where no one would dare say anything. But it\u0027s more comfortable to wear a sarong than a pair of jeans or formal pants.\u000A\u000A When you do wear A.P.C. jeans, which fit do you wear?\u000A\u000A I forget the name of the ones I just got, but I think they\u0027re the Petit New Standard in Dark Stretch. Otherwise, I have my New Standards from the past, even my old Standards. The only ones I don\u0027t wear anymore are the ones from the past that are very high-waisted. But I still have them.\u000A\u000A How did the Butler program start, and why do you think it has been successful?\u000A\u000A Yeah, I\u0027m happy, because it started as a joke really. Sometimes I joke, so I started this as a joke and I\u0027m very happy that it has worked well over a few years. The best pairs come from New York.\u000A\u000A Why\u0027s that?\u000A\u000A I mean, first of all, they are so stinky when people return those jeans. But that is the way it is, because people in New York know that jeans are incredibly beautiful when they are washed the first time, but they have to remain so disgusting for quite some time first. If you go to the Butler area of our office in Paris, I mean, they are very disgusting. When there are 50 together in a room, it smells really bad. Well, actually, the best ones would be in Japan. In Japan, they are like monks, and fanatics about denim and everything they love. You can\u0027t compete with, say, a Japanese music store. The only thing is, they keep their jeans, so we haven\u0027t been as successful with the Butler program in Japan. They just won\u0027t trade them. They would prefer to have 20-year-old jeans, because it\u0027s an achievement. In other countries, we\u0027re more willing to change our jeans sometimes. But the Butler program I know is one thing other brands could not knock off.\u000A\u000A You mentioned how bad jeans can smell if you won\u0027t wash them for a long time, but A.P.C.\u0027s care guide tells people to not wash them for a very long time. How often do you wash your jeans?\u000A\u000A It\u0027s totally hypocritical of me. When I go into my closet, I have a pile of five jeans that are numbered one through five in Roman numerals, because I don\u0027t want to wear the same pair too many times. But whenever they start to smell a bit, I wash them in the machine but with cold water and very little detergent. And I use Woolite so the soap doesn\u0027t attack the textile.\u000A\u000A On a more general note, during your last men\u0027s presentation you said that you\u0027re over minimalism. For someone who\u0027s followed A.P.C. for a while, I\u0027ve always known the brand and described the brand as \u0022minimal,\u0022 so this seems like a bit of a drastic departure.\u000A\u000A But when you work as much as we work, if we were only minimalists, we would be on holiday six months of the year. The simple things we create are not minimal to achieve. There\u0027s a difference between what is now called \u0022normcore\u0022 and simplicity. Simplicity is quite sublime. But you can use ornamentation on beautiful things. Beauty and simplicity can also have ornamentation. But in order for something to be truly sublime, it has to be simple. That\u0027s a hell of a pretentious statement, but hey, I\u0027m 62 so I can say this now.\u000A\u000A You also said you don\u0027t want A.P.C. to be known as \u0022The House of Normcore.\u0022\u000A\u000A Well, I got sick of all these new names. Normcore is not what we do. The thing about men\u0027s fashion is, if you push too much on the fashion button, the guy will end up looking ridiculous. A guy that looks too fashionable is not sexy for even one quarter of a second. All girls will tell you this, and all gay men will tell you the same. It\u0027s very difficult to do men\u0027s fashion, because you know aggressive fashion will be ridiculous. But it doesn\u0027t mean you do basic minimalism. I know it\u0027s a hard thing to understand, but it\u0027s the truth. â",

designing one of the most undeniable denim brands in the industry for 27 years seems like it would come with a lot of pressure, right? Requiring lot of rigorous study and careful calculation to remain ahead of the curve, relevant, and profitable? Actually, for Jean Touitou, founder and owner of A.P.C., it&apos;s not that big of a deal. Call it arrogance, but Touitou believes that A.P.C. does the denim thing, from fit to fabric to price, better than anyone in the world, and he doesn&apos;t care what the rest of the business is doing. You can&apos;t really blame him for being so confident in his product. Countless men have first discovered the joys and thigh-chafes that come with slowly breaking in their first pair of selvedge jeans while wearing A.P.C. That&apos;s why the brand&apos;s product is sometimes even referred to as &quot;The Gateway Denim.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.2">Stubborn as he may be, Touitou is still evolving. A.P.C. recently introduced stretch denim, which many raw denim fanatics consider heretical, but is simply indicative of Touitou&apos;s changing attitudes. The renowned minimalist even said during his most recent men&apos;s presentation in Paris that he&apos;s &quot;done with minimalism,&quot; though he finds it difficult, as many do, to explain the je ne sais quoi that makes simplicity beautiful. Here we talk to the always brutally candid Touitou about A.P.C.&apos;s success, why they introduced stretch denim, what he thinks about being called normcore, and just how often the man who started it all washes his own New Standards.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.3"> &#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>How has the denim industry changed since you founded A.P.C. in 1987?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.6"> I don&apos;t look at the denim industry. It&apos;s not interesting to me.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>You don&apos;t look at what any other brands are doing at all?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.8"> No. No, because that is not interesting to me. If I were a customer, I would do a survey about the brands that are out there. Why should I look at that if I am doing it myself? A baker makes his own bread. He doesn&apos;t go to the other bakeries for bread.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.9"> <strong>Don&apos;t you want to know how other people are trying to do denim better than you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.a"> I don&apos;t want to know how other people are trying to knock me off. That&apos;s a bit disturbing. But I don&apos;t give a fuck. I don&apos;t care. There&apos;s nothing that could make me jealous. Sometimes if there are good jeans I see, the price is not correct. I believe you not only need a good cut and good fabric, but the price has to be human. Otherwise, I could do tons of incredible things. But if the price is not human, the mission is not accomplished. The same thing goes for bags for women. Anybody with a regular amount of talent can do a beautiful dress. Okay, maybe not anybody, let&apos;s say 100 people on the planet. But if these dresses are three or four thousand dollars, it&apos;s only going to be possible to buy for a very small elite of the world. Frankly, even if I have the means to buy a pair of jeans for $1000 dollars, I wouldn&apos;t do so, because nothing about that is appealing to me.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.b"> <strong>Do you think in general jean prices have gotten more expensive?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Well, yes, because denim is a goldmine. But also because at least one or two days a week now, a gentleman will wear jeans. It&apos;s impossible for a brand to exist without jeans now. But there are too many signs on them now. People want to put their own signature on them now. Ours have no signature, except their quality.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Even at school, kids, who are maybe 13 or 14, they can tell the difference between A.P.C. and something else. These other companies don&apos;t invest the same amount of money and time into the fabric, so it just falls apart. So even for babies, it&apos;s easy to see that when it&apos;s not the real thing, it&apos;s not the real thing.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.e"> <strong>What are the things you do that separate you from other brands?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.f"> It&apos;s the cut and quality of the fabric. Nobody can compete. There is nowhere else that people can find this denim. Also, this fabric has a special recipe that has been put together by me and the weavers back in the day in Japan. The weaver is a real samurai, and he doesn&apos;t give the secret to anybody. He has a long line of people who ask, &quot;Can we have the A.P.C. fabric?&quot; and he will answer, &quot;No! I gave them my word!&quot; There is something secret in our fabric that nobody knows. Even I try to forget the secret so I&apos;m not tempted to reveal it to anyone.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.g"> <strong>When you first started A.P.C., what were the first jeans you introduced?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.h"> The first pair we introduced was made with basically the same fabrics we are using today. Since then we&apos;ve been introducing new fabrics. Not too long ago, we introduced denim with stretch, black denim, white, but the fundamental denim is the same and has been the same recipe for 27 years.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.i"> <strong>What made you want to introduce stretch denim into the collection?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.j"> Well, I needed more comfort for myself maybe. In the past, stretch denim hasn&apos;t been so good and I think the stretch we do ads comfort. I&apos;m not a militant of the tiny pants trend for men. Also, the stretch denim falls nicely.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.k"> <strong>How do you feel when you see people in A.P.C. jeans that they&apos;ve had for years and years?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.l"> I couldn&apos;t say the contrary, obviously. I&apos;m not going to say, &quot;Oh that sucks that the jeans have been successful.&quot; I&apos;m happy when I see that, yes.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.m"> <strong>How often do you get a new pair of A.P.C. jeans?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.n"> You know, lately I&apos;m trying to avoid wearing jeans. I prefer to wear sarongs, or a piece of fabric around my hips.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.o"> <strong>Do you wear the sarong outside?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.p"> No, because I live in a very conservative place called France. They call themselves revolutionaries but they are extremely conservative. But I wear them in the office with my staff where no one would dare say anything. But it&apos;s more comfortable to wear a sarong than a pair of jeans or formal pants.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.q"> <strong>When you do wear A.P.C. jeans, which fit do you wear?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.r"> I forget the name of the ones I just got, but I think they&apos;re the Petit New Standard in Dark Stretch. Otherwise, I have my New Standards from the past, even my old Standards. The only ones I don&apos;t wear anymore are the ones from the past that are very high-waisted. But I still have them.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.s"> <strong>How did the Butler program start, and why do you think it has been successful?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.t"> Yeah, I&apos;m happy, because it started as a joke really. Sometimes I joke, so I started this as a joke and I&apos;m very happy that it has worked well over a few years. The best pairs come from New York.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.u"> <strong>Why&apos;s that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.v"> I mean, first of all, they are so stinky when people return those jeans. But that is the way it is, because people in New York know that jeans are incredibly beautiful when they are washed the first time, but they have to remain so disgusting for quite some time first. If you go to the Butler area of our office in Paris, I mean, they are very disgusting. When there are 50 together in a room, it smells really bad. Well, actually, the best ones would be in Japan. In Japan, they are like monks, and fanatics about denim and everything they love. You can&apos;t compete with, say, a Japanese music store. The only thing is, they keep their jeans, so we haven&apos;t been as successful with the Butler program in Japan. They just won&apos;t trade them. They would prefer to have 20-year-old jeans, because it&apos;s an achievement. In other countries, we&apos;re more willing to change our jeans sometimes. But the Butler program I know is one thing other brands could not knock off.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.w"> <strong>You mentioned how bad jeans can smell if you won&apos;t wash them for a long time, but A.P.C.&apos;s care guide tells people to not wash them for a very long time. How often do you wash your jeans?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.x"> It&apos;s totally hypocritical of me. When I go into my closet, I have a pile of five jeans that are numbered one through five in Roman numerals, because I don&apos;t want to wear the same pair too many times. But whenever they start to smell a bit, I wash them in the machine but with cold water and very little detergent. And I use Woolite so the soap doesn&apos;t attack the textile.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.y"> <strong>On a more general note, during your last men&apos;s presentation you said that you&apos;re over minimalism. For someone who&apos;s followed A.P.C. for a while, I&apos;ve always known the brand and described the brand as &quot;minimal,&quot; so this seems like a bit of a drastic departure.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.z"> But when you work as much as we work, if we were only minimalists, we would be on holiday six months of the year. The simple things we create are not minimal to achieve. There&apos;s a difference between what is now called &quot;normcore&quot; and simplicity. Simplicity is quite sublime. But you can use ornamentation on beautiful things. Beauty and simplicity can also have ornamentation. But in order for something to be truly sublime, it has to be simple. That&apos;s a hell of a pretentious statement, but hey, I&apos;m 62 so I can say this now.</p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.10"> <strong>You also said you don&apos;t want A.P.C. to be known as &quot;The House of Normcore.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.4.11"> Well, I got sick of all these new names. Normcore is not what we do. The thing about men&apos;s fashion is, if you push too much on the fashion button, the guy will end up looking ridiculous. A guy that looks too fashionable is not sexy for even one quarter of a second. All girls will tell you this, and all gay men will tell you the same. It&apos;s very difficult to do men&apos;s fashion, because you know aggressive fashion will be ridiculous. But it doesn&apos;t mean you do basic minimalism. I know it&apos;s a hard thing to understand, but it&apos;s the truth. &#xE2;&#x80;&#x8B;</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1kaz492s268.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
