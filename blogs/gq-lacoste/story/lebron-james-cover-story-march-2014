  	    "articleBody": "After morning practice, after the media session, LeBron James went to the locker room and iced, then got pulled for a random piss test, so now he\u0027s late, which he does not like being. Also, he\u0027s tired. There\u0027s a chef here at the warehouse, where Tupac and Snoop and Jay Z keep the rhythm, and hot lights shine over racks of clothes and shoes to put on, which he loves—he loves this shit—fashion is his candy, just ask Randy, to whom he has handed his phone to take photos. He wants pictures of himself in the outfits, maybe to tweet, which he also loves. But he\u0027s tired, that\u0027s the thing. Sluggish. And so right in the middle of a sentence about chicken and hot sauce, which the chef just handed him, he switches gears, and his eyes pop wide, and his mouth goes rubbery, and, enunciating perfectly, he booms: You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin / Niggaz be actin like they savage, they out to get the cabbage / I got nuthin but love, for my niggaz livin lavish.\u000A\u000APeople seem used to it. None of his handlers give pause. But it does seem a little...dissociative.\u000A\u000AMotherfuck the rest, two of the best from the west side / And I can make you famous / Niggaz been dyin for years, so how could they blame us?\u000A\u000AHe loves to sing. He refuses to have anything to do with coffee. Singing is his coffee. Rejuvenated, he dances in the outfits for the camera, clowns like he always did back in high school, gets every bored person here happy.\u000A\u000AHe would like to be an actor. A comedy actor. He\u0027s shooting his first movie, Ballers, with Kevin Hart. The other thing he would like is to play in the NFL. \u0022Some days I want to be a singer. But my voice? Then the next day I want to be Picasso.\u0022 He would like to be a billionaire. \u0022If it happens. It\u0027s my biggest milestone. Obviously. I want to maximize my business. And if I happen to get it, if I happen to be a billion-dollar athlete, ho. Hip hip hooray! Oh, my God, I\u0027m gonna be excited.\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027m tight grill when my situation ain\u0027t improvin / I\u0027m tryin to murder everything movin.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s ten years into this insane career. Probably ten more to go with the NBA, he figures. So it\u0027s about halftime. It\u0027s something to think about. \u0022My drive to be the greatest basketball player ever is very high.\u0022 Everything right now is fantastic. A Miami mansion, a beautiful wife and two sons. Cars. More money than any other American athlete besides Floyd Mayweather, God love him. Sportswriters are having orgasms: The King is going for a three-peat with the Miami Heat, he has won four of the past five NBA MVP awards, his right arm is as fast as a helicopter blade, and he could notch a triple-double every night if he wanted.\u000A\u000AControlled exceptionalism, the most gifted ever? The game seems so easy he\u0027s left challenging only his own efficiency. They say he\u0027s Michael Jordan for a new generation. Or maybe they\u0027ll say Michael Jordan was the LeBron James of his generation, same difference, history will not bother splitting hairs. \u0022Dr. J couldn\u0027t do what he does. Magic couldn\u0027t do what he does,\u0022 says Heat president Pat Riley.\u000A\u000ABeing excellent at absolutely everything like this, it carries responsibility. Off the court, on the court, it weighs on him. All those people wanting more points out of him. They pay to see a superhero, and the superhero should shoot the ball, create lanes into which he can explode into everlasting glory, like Baryshnikov performing consecutive grands jet&amp;#xE8;s, like Pavarotti achieving nine effortless high C\u0027s in one aria. (Seventeen curtain calls for that one.) People who pay to see history being made expect history to be made.\u000A\u000A\u0022Like, I could average thirty-five points a game if I really wanted to,\u0022 he says. He is beautifully handsome, solid and smooth as a sycamore. \u0022But then—it wouldn\u0027t be me,\u0022 he says. \u0022So I don\u0027t know if I could do it, because of my instincts. I see a teammate open—even if I have a great shot—I see a teammate open for a better shot, I gotta feed him. It\u0027s like, my mind sometimes be like \u0027Shoot it,\u0027 but then—my instincts, you know?\u0022\u000A\u000AHe is thoughtful. He is a man who chews on ideas this way and that, enjoys the texture. The battle between predisposition and will. It\u0027s something to think about. \u0022This thing is about more than just basketball,\u0022 he says. \u0022I can play basketball with my eyes closed and my hands tied behind my back. The way my mind, my mind starts working, we could probably be here for like...it could be like midnight. Someone will have to turn my switch off.\u0022\u000A\u000AOne of the things that bothers him is when people say, \u0022You\u0027ve changed.\u0022 First of all, he hasn\u0027t. He still has his instincts. He still has Akron sitting in him like a bag of cement.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022Winning is my drug,\u0022 he says. \u0022Winning is my ice cream. Like my kids. They want more. \u0027More! More!\u0027 They just want more.\u0022\u000A\u000AActually, no. Right now Bryce, who is 6, is staring down at a melting bowl of something beige in a shop minutes away from the family\u0027s mansion in Miami\u0027s Coconut Grove.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yo, what\u0027s the matter?\u0022 says James, six feet eight, 250 pounds collapsed into an itty-bitty ice-cream-parlor chair, motioning to his son, who is not complaining, who is sitting alone, silent, and not easy to notice amid the swirl: customers, cops, some of James\u0027s handlers, ice cream scoopers, a floor mopper, and his wife, Savannah, in yoga pants, a yellow tee, eating salad from a Tupperware container she brought, ercising mother power well-wrought. \u0022I said now!\u0022 she barks at 9-year-old Bronny, who actually, technically, prefers later. The family is background. James is foreground. Everyone gets it. Daddy is working, tossing out quotes to one enraptured person or another, about this game and that game, to dunk or to pass, to stay in this city or go to that one (no, he has no answer about Miami), to sell a sneaker, a TV, a hamburger. Savannah is not the type to do some wife dance for the enraptured people. She will avoid making eye contact if she can get away with it. She\u0027s the serious one. He\u0027s the funny one, the charismatic, cool one. They got married last summer, having been together since high school in Akron, since way before he became King James.\u000A\u000A\u0022You don\u0027t like your ice cream?\u0022 James calls to his son.\u000A\u000ABryce looks down at the melt, up at his dad. Demoralizing. Hard to admit. A dud of a flavor choice. \u0022I don\u0027t like it,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A\u0022Go get something else!\u0022 James says. \u0022Try something else. You ain\u0027t got no complaints!\u0022\u000A\u000AFatherhood, he says, is a lot like sports. \u0022Being a leader of my household, a leader of Miami, a leader of Team USA. It\u0027s the same exact thing. You can sense when a guy is frustrated—maybe doesn\u0027t feel involved enough in the offense. As leader you go over to him, you know, \u0027How can I help?\u0027 Because at the end of the day, we all have one common goal—and that\u0027s to be great.\u0022\u000A\u000AWinning, being great, it\u0027s the whole point of life. Is it not? Is there any reason to tiptoe around that fact? Winning, James says, is what a team does, not a person. That notion sits at his core and explains everything. The tattoo across his back, huge, shoulder to shoulder, says chosen 1. It\u0027s not simply precocious. It\u0027s bigger than that. It\u0027s what happened back in Akron, an American allegory. A dirt-poor fatherless nobody alone in his bed at night, hoping for his mom to come home, which she didn\u0027t—for a couple of years.\u000A\u000AAll that, and now all this.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABasketball took hold. In his senior year of high school, averages of 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game. Averages. But the thing that really happened back then was a team. A family. You finally get one, you cling. All those guys. Sian, Willie, Dru on the Fighting Irish, of course, but also Maverick and Rich and Randy, all those guys who would come over his place in the projects, where his mom finally landed, $22 a month for a tiny apartment, and everyone wanted to hang there. Like a family reunion every single day, playing video games, goofing around. He says they came there because they loved his mom. They say it was because of him. \u0022His charisma,\u0022 says Randy Mims, who back then filled the role of big brother and is now his day-to-day manager. \u0022Everyone wanted to be around him. He was born with it. He still has it. It\u0027s what fills arenas.\u0022\u000A\u000ANext thing he\u0027s 17 years old, he\u0027s on the cover of Sports Illustrated. A Nike contract. First overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers.\u000A\u000A\u0022I go from $10 in my pocket to $100 million. In high school. Yup.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASo, second of all, regarding change, of course he\u0027s changed. \u0022Good! That\u0027s like a good thing,\u0022 he says. \u0022I\u0027m like, \u0027Thank you.\u0027 Shit. I\u0027m 29 years old with a family—I\u0027m married with a family. I—of course I\u0027ve changed. The problem is, you haven\u0027t changed. And that\u0027s why you dislike what I do, you know.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe leans forward. He\u0027s not going to be interrupted on this point. \u0022As an African-American, we hear it a lot where we grow up. You\u0027ve changed.\u0022 He\u0027s sick of hearing it used as a criticism. \u0022Because you\u0027ve tried to better yourself and because you\u0027ve made it out. \u0027You\u0027re not the same person that we used to know.\u0027 Of course I\u0027m not. I\u0027m trying to better myself. Change is not a bad thing. Thinking that it\u0027s bad, you know, that\u0027s one thing I think is a downfall for African-Americans for sure.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen he was still with the Cavs, he got a tattoo on his right forearm: 330. The Akron area code.\u000A\u000AOne person he thanks for all his success is his father. Well, it\u0027s not actually a thanks. More of a conversation. \u0022Like, \u0027Wow, Dad, you know what, I don\u0027t know you, I have no idea who you are, but because of you is part of the reason who I am today.\u0027 The fuel that I use—you not being there—it\u0027s part of the reason I grew up to become who I am. It\u0027s part of the reason why I want to be hands-on with my endeavors. And be able to put my guys that\u0027s with me now in position. Like Maverick Carter, my right-hand guy in my business. Rich Paul, my agent. Randy Mims, my friend—he\u0027s my manager, you know. So me in a position allowing people around me to grow, that maybe wouldn\u0027t have happened if I had two parents, two sisters, a dog, and a picket fence, you know?\u0022\u000A\u000AChange, of course, is exactly what turned James into basketball\u0027s most hated villain for a stretch. That story occupies an indelible chapter in pop-culture history. He left Cleveland in 2010 to go play for Miami. The Decision. Over 13 million people watching the big obnoxious reality show, which was, he\u0027ll remind you, to benefit the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. But still. Tone-deaf. The guys from Akron had a lot to learn about how to run a multimillion-dollar athlete\u0027s career. \u0022Crazy,\u0022 says Mims. \u0022I don\u0027t think any of us had any idea we\u0027d get the reaction we did. I think we were all in shock.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe hissy fit in Cleveland—and across the Midwest, and inside like-minded pockets of America nationwide—was not subtle. People in the streets set fire to LeBron James jerseys. They stabbed LeBron James dolls. Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cavaliers, threw gasoline on the flames. A \u0022shameful display of selfishness and betrayal by one of our very own,\u0022 he told Cleveland in an open letter. A \u0022shocking act of disloyalty.... The self-declared former \u0027King\u0027 will be taking the \u0027curse\u0027 with him down south....Sleep well, Cleveland.\u0022\u000A\u000APoop on him!\u000A\u000AThe reaction was so strong and childish, a lot of people eventually woke up and looked inward.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Decision show was a flop. He gets that. But the decision itself was just a man having a growth spurt. \u0022The best thing that ever happened to me,\u0022 he says. \u0022I needed it. It helped me grow as a man. As a professional, as a father. At the time, as a boyfriend. It helped me grow. Being confined, I spent my whole life in Akron, Ohio. For twenty-five years. Even though I played professionally in Cleveland, I still lived in Akron. Everything was comfortable. I knew everything, everybody knew me—everything was comfortable. I needed to become uncomfortable.\u000A\u000A\u0022Now I\u0027ve seen everything on and off the floor this league has to offer,\u0022 he says. \u0022I got an answer for everything. Winning, losing, being a free agent, staying, leaving, media, media down on you, media big up on you, agents, money, parking it, family, money. All, everything. So whatever your question is, I can deliver.\u0022\u000A\u000AFormer Texas A&amp;M quarterback Johnny Manziel said in an interview that the thing he was most thankful for when getting crushed by the media was James texting him and giving him advice.\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, seriously?\u0022 says James, flashing a grin. \u0022He said that?\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat did he tell Manziel?\u000A\u000A\u0022My secret words.\u0022\u000A\u000AHow about Pacers swingman Paul George? That hand slap in Game 2 last year? The two were going at it, genius versus genius, George beating James with a hard dunk, James answering with a deep three-pointer. After the horn, James followed George, reached for him, said, \u0022I got you back, young fella,\u0022 and so they slapped hands, enemies fraternizing. Ever since the slap, George is having the season of his life, and now people act like James put magic Jesus oil on him.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m very good at knowing talent, I guess,\u0022 he says about his friendship with George. \u0022I knew he could be really, really good. I had a couple of conversations with him. I just see talent in a guy.... I\u0027d do it for anyone. But if someone reaches out to me for advice how to get better, I\u0027m doing it. I can\u0027t tell what I said. My secret words.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe has a thing for greatness. \u0022I\u0027m always keepin\u0027 on other athletes. I love Tom Brady. I love the comparisons with him and Joe Montana. I love Floyd Mayweather—the comparisons with him and Muhammad Ali. \u0027Ooo, can Floyd Mayweather be the greatest of all time?\u0027 You know. Things like that. Sidney Crosby and the duel between him and Alex Ovechkin and who\u0027s the best, you know. Even to a point where, like, Kyle Korver just broke the three-point record for consecutive games. Like, ninety games straight, he\u0027s had a three-point. I was like, \u0027Wow, that\u0027s crazy.\u0027 You know, I don\u0027t even know that stuff about me until, actually, if I\u0027m watching SportsCenter or reading social media. I had no idea that I\u0027ve gone this long with scoring consecutive double-digit points until I see... I had no idea. I didn\u0027t know what number I was at. I was like, \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027 I was like, \u0027Oh, for real? I got 500 straight double-digit games?\u0027 Like, it\u0027s still in counting now, I\u0027m up there with Kareem and Jordan. It\u0027s like, sheesh. I\u0027ve done some pretty good things.\u0022\u000A\u000AAround the time he won his second NBA championship with Miami in 2013, he got a tattoo high and bold across his right shoulder. akron, it says.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022Miley Cyrus? She has a great voice! She don\u0027t need the shenanigans. She can have some of the shenanigans, but not all of the shenanigans, you know? And she can be at peace! She can be at peace.\u000A\u000A\u0022Shenanigans.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s safe to say now, three years into life in Miami, that LeBron James\u0027s villain persona did not stick. He tops the league\u0027s list of best-selling jerseys. His sneakers crush the competition in stores, outselling Kobe, his nearest footwear rival, like six to one. The LeBron 11, for $200, has hyperposite construction—a combination of Foamposite material and performance synthetics—and a new layer of Lunarlon cushioning; and anyway, Nike generates about $300 million off the sneakers.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestTerry Richardson\u000A\u000AJames did not go on a PR offensive to achieve redemption among the people who were burning the jerseys and stabbing the dolls. People thinking of him as some run-of-the-mill narcissistic asshole would give up, he figured. Keep doing what you do and people eventually figure out there is more to the story.\u000A\u000A\u0022The thing is, he hasn\u0027t changed,\u0022 says billionaire Warren Buffett, his friend of six years. They eat hamburgers, go shopping in Omaha together. \u0022He\u0027s a solid guy. Fame has not gone to his head. You have to give him credit. I would have been drunk with power. It says a lot about how his mind works.\u0022\u000A\u000AHis mind works by way of Akron. He hosted the whole Miami Heat team for Thanksgiving last year back in Akron. \u0022I\u0027m the biggest voice that my hometown has ever seen,\u0022 James says. \u0022I\u0027m the biggest figure that my hometown has ever seen. I do know that. I can see that. The responsibility of being the inspiration and the light for my community—it\u0027s much greater than hitting a jump shot.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen he talks about his responsibility to his community, he doesn\u0027t go into charity-speak. Although there is plenty of that. He talks bigger. His responsibility, he says, is to the people in his community who get those words thrown at them: \u0022You\u0027ve changed.\u0022 People in his own community accusing each other. \u0022It\u0027s my responsibility to show them it\u0027s not a bad thing to be someone who\u0027s changed. Keep showing them what I\u0027m doing. That what I\u0027m doing is right. I\u0027m not, obviously, I\u0027m not no guru on life or guru on success or guru on, you know, huge topics in the world or in America. But I am an example. I\u0027m an example that can be used.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert wrote the open letter to Cleveland rallying its people to feel betrayed, the Reverend Jesse L. Jackson decided to respond to it.\u000A\u000A\u0022He speaks as an owner of LeBron,\u0022 he wrote, \u0022and not the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers. His feelings of betrayal personify a slave master mentality. He sees LeBron as a runaway slave.... LeBron is not a child, nor is he bound to play on Gilbert\u0027s plantation and be demeaned.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt was shocking to people. To associate America\u0027s tragic past with modern sports. To make the link. To shine a light on the disproportionate ratio of black athletes to black professionals in ownership positions, or up atop any of the corporate ladders selling the swag. The conversation caught fire for a few days, then blew itself out. Uncomfortable. Buzzkill. One part of a much larger conversation that everyone keeps never having, that the artists hear, and sing songs about, making records that confound half of America trying to understand what\u0027s the matter with those people.\u000A\u000AJealousy is misery, suffering is grief / Better be prepared. When you cowards fuck with me / I bust and flee / These niggaz must be crazy—what?? \u000A\u000ABy 2012, Dan Gilbert was well over his LeBron James-abandonment hissy fit. He opened Cleveland\u0027s first casino, with 1,900 slot machines and eighty-nine table games.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AA customer comes up to him at the ice cream parlor. She can\u0027t stand it anymore. King James! She\u0027s curly, suburban. \u0022Well—just, thank you,\u0022 she says clumsily. \u0022Thank you for everything.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Um,\u0022 he says. You\u0027d think he\u0027d have more prepared retorts. \u0022Thank you for having me.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s getting to be time to leave. He\u0027s got business back at home. Savannah has the kids over at a chalkboard on the wall, playing hangman, and now the puzzle is for Bryce. Remember he is 6, so this is difficult. \u0022I know the answer!\u0022 James says, looking on. \u0022I know it!\u0022 Savannah throws him wife eyes. Don\u0027t you even.\u000A\u000ASavannah: \u0022Give me a letter.\u0022\u000A\u000ABryce: \u0022Um.\u0022\u000A\u000ASavannah: \u0022A letter. Three, two, one—\u0022\u000A\u000ABryce: \u0022M.\u0022\u000A\u000AJames: \u0022M? No.\u0022\u000A\u000ASavannah draws a noose around the head of the figure on the hangman puzzle.\u000A\u000AJames: \u0022Draw him a neck. He gets a neck!\u0022\u000A\u000ASavannah: \u0022We do the body, and then the arms and legs.\u0022\u000A\u000AJames: \u0022A shirt and tie?\u0022\u000A\u000ABronny: \u0022A suit and tie.\u0022\u000A\u000ASavannah: \u0022Give me a letter.\u0022\u000A\u000ABryce: \u0022D?\u0022\u000A\u000AJames: \u0022There it is! Yeah, there\u0027s a D!\u0022\u000A\u000ASavannah: \u0022No, there\u0027s not.\u0022\u000A\u000AJames: \u0022Oh, dang.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis goes on and on. Arms, legs, suit, tie, eyes, nose, hat. Little steps for the hanged man to have climbed to his own ecution. Bryce has his finger on his lip, thinking. They need to leave. Go home. Important people waiting. Many other American families would have long since bailed. One letter finishes the puzzle: Bryce is coo_!\u000A\u000A\u0022C-O-O!\u0022 James is saying, his big body now on the edge of his ice-cream-parlor seat, like any fan in any arena late in the fourth. Buzzer time.\u000A\u000ASavannah: \u0022Give me a letter, Bryce.\u0022\u000A\u000AJames: \u0022Bryce! It says \u0027Bryce is C-O-O!\u0027 Coooooo! Coooooo!\u0022\u000A\u000ASavannah: \u0022A letter—\u0022\u000A\u000AJames: \u0022Coooooooooo!\u0022\u000A\u000ABryce: \u0022L!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Nailed it!\u0022 James says, leaping to his feet. \u0022Bryce is cool!\u0022 They high-five, spin, a family in an ice cream parlor, rejoicing.\u000A\u000AThe tattoo running down his right calf spells: Witness. And down his left: History.\u000A\u000AJeanne Marie Laskas(@jmlaskas) is a GQ correspondent.",

It&#39;s nice, right? Always sunny. Palm trees. A pair of championships, working on a third. The Decision? That worked out just fine. And at the center of it all, always making and remaking his world exactly as he likes it: the most stylish empire-builder in sports. &quot;This thing is about more than just basketball,&quot; he says. Sort of makes you wonder: What will the King conquer next?</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.0">After morning practice, after the media session, LeBron James went to the locker room and iced, then got pulled for a random piss test, so now he&#x2019;s late, which he does not like being. Also, he&#x2019;s tired. There&#x2019;s a chef here at the warehouse, where Tupac and Snoop and Jay Z keep the rhythm, and hot lights shine over racks of clothes and shoes to put on, which he loves&#x2014;he loves this shit&#x2014;fashion is his candy, just ask Randy, to whom he has handed his phone to take photos. He wants pictures of himself in the outfits, maybe to tweet, which he also loves. But he&#x2019;s tired, that&#x2019;s the thing. Sluggish. And so right in the middle of a sentence about chicken and hot sauce, which the chef just handed him, he switches gears, and his eyes pop wide, and his mouth goes rubbery, and, enunciating perfectly, he booms: <em>You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin / Niggaz be actin like they savage, they out to get the cabbage / I got nuthin but love, for my niggaz livin lavish.</em></p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.1">People seem used to it. None of his handlers give pause. But it does seem a little...dissociative.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.2"><em>Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the west side / And I can make you famous / Niggaz been dyin for years, so how could they blame us?</em></p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.3">He loves to sing. He refuses to have anything to do with coffee. Singing is his coffee. Rejuvenated, he dances in the outfits for the camera, clowns like he always did back in high school, gets every bored person here happy.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.5">He would like to be an actor. A comedy actor. He&#x2019;s shooting his first movie, <em>Ballers</em>, with Kevin Hart. The other thing he would like is to play in the NFL. &quot;Some days I want to be a singer. But my voice? Then the next day I want to be Picasso.&quot; He would like to be a billionaire. &quot;If it happens. It&#x2019;s my biggest milestone. Obviously. I want to maximize my business. And if I happen to get it, if I happen to be a billion-dollar athlete, ho. Hip hip hooray! Oh, my God, I&#x2019;m gonna be excited.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.6"><em>I&#x2019;m tight grill when my situation ain&#x2019;t improvin / I&#x2019;m tryin to murder everything movin.</em></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.7"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.8">He&#x2019;s ten years into this insane career. Probably ten more to go with the NBA, he figures. So it&#x2019;s about halftime. It&#x2019;s something to think about. &quot;My drive to be the greatest basketball player ever is very high.&quot; Everything right now is fantastic. A Miami mansion, a beautiful wife and two sons. Cars. More money than any other American athlete besides Floyd Mayweather, God love him. Sportswriters are having orgasms: <em>The King is going for a three-peat with the Miami Heat, he has won four of the past five NBA MVP awards, his right arm is as fast as a helicopter blade, and he could notch a triple-double every night if he wanted.</em></p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.9">Controlled exceptionalism, the most gifted ever? The game seems so easy he&#x2019;s left challenging only his own efficiency. They say he&#x2019;s Michael Jordan for a new generation. Or maybe they&#x2019;ll say Michael Jordan was the LeBron James of his generation, same difference, history will not bother splitting hairs. &quot;Dr. J couldn&#x2019;t do what he does. Magic couldn&#x2019;t do what he does,&quot; says Heat president Pat Riley.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.a">Being excellent at absolutely everything like this, it carries responsibility. Off the court, on the court, it weighs on him. All those people wanting more points out of him. They pay to see a superhero, and the superhero should shoot the ball, create lanes into which he can explode into everlasting glory, like Baryshnikov performing consecutive grands jet&amp;#xE8;s, like Pavarotti achieving nine effortless high C&#x2019;s in one aria. (Seventeen curtain calls for that one.) People who pay to see history being made expect <em>history to be made.</em></p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.b">&quot;Like, I could average thirty-five points a game if I really wanted to,&quot; he says. He is beautifully handsome, solid and smooth as a sycamore. &quot;But then&#x2014;it wouldn&#x2019;t be me,&quot; he says. &quot;So I don&#x2019;t know if I could do it, because of my instincts. I see a teammate open&#x2014;even if I have a great shot&#x2014;I see a teammate open for a better shot, I gotta feed him. It&#x2019;s like, my mind sometimes be like &#x2019;Shoot it,&#x2019; but then&#x2014;my instincts, you know?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.c">He is thoughtful. He is a man who chews on ideas this way and that, enjoys the texture. The battle between predisposition and will. It&#x2019;s something to think about. &quot;This thing is about more than just basketball,&quot; he says. &quot;I can play basketball with my eyes closed and my hands tied behind my back. The way my mind, my mind starts working, we could probably be here for like...it could be like midnight. Someone will have to turn my switch off.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.d">One of the things that bothers him is when people say, &quot;You&#x2019;ve changed.&quot; First of all, he hasn&#x2019;t. He still has his instincts. He still has Akron sitting in him like a bag of cement.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.e"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.f">&quot;Winning is my drug,&quot; he says. &quot;Winning is my ice cream. Like my kids. They want more. &#x2019;More! More!&#x2019; They just want<em> more</em>.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.g">Actually, no. Right now Bryce, who is 6, is staring down at a melting bowl of something beige in a shop minutes away from the family&#x2019;s mansion in Miami&#x2019;s Coconut Grove.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.h">&quot;Yo, what&#x2019;s the matter?&quot; says James, six feet eight, 250 pounds collapsed into an itty-bitty ice-cream-parlor chair, motioning to his son, who is not complaining, who is sitting alone, silent, and not easy to notice amid the swirl: customers, cops, some of James&#x2019;s handlers, ice cream scoopers, a floor mopper, and his wife, Savannah, in yoga pants, a yellow tee, eating salad from a Tupperware container she brought, ercising mother power well-wrought. &quot;I said <em>now</em>!&quot; she barks at 9-year-old Bronny, who actually, technically, prefers later. The family is background. James is foreground. Everyone gets it. Daddy is working, tossing out quotes to one enraptured person or another, about this game and that game, to dunk or to pass, to stay in this city or go to that one (no, he has no answer about Miami), to sell a sneaker, a TV, a hamburger. Savannah is not the type to do some wife dance for the enraptured people. She will avoid making eye contact if she can get away with it. She&#x2019;s the serious one. He&#x2019;s the funny one, the charismatic, cool one. They got married last summer, having been together since high school in Akron, since way before he became King James.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;You don&#x2019;t like your ice cream?&quot; James calls to his son.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.j">Bryce looks down at the melt, up at his dad. Demoralizing. Hard to admit. A dud of a flavor choice. &quot;I don&#x2019;t like it,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.k">&quot;Go get something else!&quot; James says. &quot;Try something else. You ain&#x2019;t got no complaints!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.l">Fatherhood, he says, is a lot like sports. &quot;Being a leader of my household, a leader of Miami, a leader of Team USA. It&#x2019;s the same exact thing. You can sense when a guy is frustrated&#x2014;maybe doesn&#x2019;t feel involved enough in the offense. As leader you go over to him, you know, &#x2019;How can I help?&#x2019; Because at the end of the day, we all have one common goal&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s to be great.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.m">Winning, being great, it&#x2019;s the whole point of life. Is it not? Is there any reason to tiptoe around that fact? Winning, James says, is what a team does, not a person. That notion sits at his core and explains everything. The tattoo across his back, huge, shoulder to shoulder, says chosen 1. It&#x2019;s not simply precocious. It&#x2019;s bigger than that. It&#x2019;s what happened back in Akron, an American allegory. A dirt-poor fatherless nobody alone in his bed at night, hoping for his mom to come home, which she didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;for a couple of years.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.n">All that, and now all this.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.o"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/56159746e8a83977119f5f67/master/w_600/lebron-james-gq-0314-04.jpg" alt="lebron-james-gq-0314-04.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flebron-james-cover-story-march-2014&amp;t=lebron-james-gq-0314-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flebron-james-cover-story-march-2014&amp;t=lebron-james-gq-0314-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flebron-james-cover-story-march-2014&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F56159746e8a83977119f5f67%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flebron-james-gq-0314-04.jpg&amp;description=lebron-james-gq-0314-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flebron-james-cover-story-march-2014&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F56159746e8a83977119f5f67%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flebron-james-gq-0314-04.jpg&amp;description=lebron-james-gq-0314-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.p">Basketball took hold. In his senior year of high school, averages of 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game. <em>Averages</em>. But the thing that really happened back then was a team. A family. You finally get one, you cling. All those guys. Sian, Willie, Dru on the Fighting Irish, of course, but also Maverick and Rich and Randy, all those guys who would come over his place in the projects, where his mom finally landed, $22 a month for a tiny apartment, and everyone wanted to hang there. Like a family reunion every single day, playing video games, goofing around. He says they came there because they loved his mom. They say it was because of him. &quot;His charisma,&quot; says Randy Mims, who back then filled the role of big brother and is now his day-to-day manager. &quot;Everyone wanted to be around him. He was born with it. He still has it. It&#x2019;s what fills arenas.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.q">Next thing he&#x2019;s 17 years old, he&#x2019;s on the cover of <em>Sports Illustrated</em>. A Nike contract.

That&#x2019;s like a good thing,&quot; he says. &quot;I&#x2019;m like, &#x2019;Thank you.&#x2019; Shit. I&#x2019;m 29 years old with a family&#x2014;I&#x2019;m married with a family. I&#x2014;of course I&#x2019;ve changed. The problem is, <em>you</em> haven&#x2019;t changed. And that&#x2019;s why you dislike what I do, you know.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.u">He leans forward. He&#x2019;s not going to be interrupted on this point. &quot;As an African-American, we hear it a lot where we grow up. <em>You&#x2019;ve changed</em>.&quot; He&#x2019;s sick of hearing it used as a criticism. &quot;Because you&#x2019;ve tried to better yourself and because you&#x2019;ve made it out. &#x2019;You&#x2019;re not the same person that we used to know.&#x2019; Of course I&#x2019;m not. I&#x2019;m trying to better myself. Change is not a bad thing.

The Akron area code.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.w">One person he thanks for all his success is his father. Well, it&#x2019;s not actually a thanks. More of a conversation. &quot;Like, &#x2019;Wow, Dad, you know what, I don&#x2019;t know you, I have no idea who you are, but because of you is part of the reason who I am today.&#x2019; The fuel that I use&#x2014;you not being there&#x2014;it&#x2019;s part of the reason I grew up to become who I am. It&#x2019;s part of the reason why I want to be hands-on with my endeavors. And be able to put my guys that&#x2019;s with me now in position. Like Maverick Carter, my right-hand guy in my business. Rich Paul, my agent. Randy Mims, my friend&#x2014;he&#x2019;s my manager, you know.

That story occupies an indelible chapter in pop-culture history. He left Cleveland in 2010 to go play for Miami. <em>The Decision</em>. Over 13 million people watching the big obnoxious reality show, which was, he&#x2019;ll remind you, to benefit the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. But still. Tone-deaf. The guys from Akron had a lot to learn about how to run a multimillion-dollar athlete&#x2019;s career. &quot;Crazy,&quot; says Mims. &quot;I don&#x2019;t think any of us had any idea we&#x2019;d get the reaction we did. I think we were all in shock.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.y">The hissy fit in Cleveland&#x2014;and across the Midwest, and inside like-minded pockets of America nationwide&#x2014;was not subtle. People in the streets set fire to LeBron James jerseys. They stabbed LeBron James dolls. Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cavaliers, threw gasoline on the flames. A &quot;shameful display of selfishness and betrayal by one of our very own,&quot; he told Cleveland in an open letter. A &quot;shocking act of disloyalty.... The self-declared former &#x2019;King&#x2019; will be taking the &#x2019;curse&#x2019; with him down south....Sleep well, Cleveland.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.z"><em>Poop on him!</em></p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.10">The reaction was so strong and childish, a lot of people eventually woke up and looked inward.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.11"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.12">The Decision show was a flop. He gets that. But the decision itself was just a man having a growth spurt. &quot;The best thing that ever happened to me,&quot; he says. &quot;I needed it. It helped me grow as a man. As a professional, as a father. At the time, as a boyfriend. It helped me grow. Being confined, I spent my whole life in Akron, Ohio. For twenty-five years. Even though I played professionally in Cleveland, I still lived in Akron. Everything was comfortable. I knew everything, everybody knew me&#x2014;everything was comfortable. I needed to become uncomfortable.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.13">&quot;Now I&#x2019;ve seen everything on and off the floor this league has to offer,&quot; he says. &quot;I got an answer for everything. Winning, losing, being a free agent, staying, leaving, media, media down on you, media big up on you, agents, money, parking it, family, money. All, everything. So whatever your question is, I can deliver.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.14">Former Texas A&amp;M quarterback Johnny Manziel said in an interview that the thing he was most thankful for when getting crushed by the media was James texting him and giving him advice.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.15">&quot;Oh, seriously?&quot; says James, flashing a grin. &quot;He said that?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.16">What did he tell Manziel?</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.17">&quot;My secret words.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.18">How about Pacers swingman Paul George? That hand slap in Game 2 last year? The two were going at it, genius versus genius, George beating James with a hard dunk, James answering with a deep three-pointer. After the horn, James followed George, reached for him, said, &quot;I got you back, young fella,&quot; and so they slapped hands, enemies fraternizing. Ever since the slap, George is having the season of his life, and now people act like James put magic Jesus oil on him.</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.19">&quot;I&#x2019;m very good at knowing talent, I guess,&quot; he says about his friendship with George. &quot;I knew he could be really, really good. I had a couple of conversations with him. I just see talent in a guy.... I&#x2019;d do it for anyone. But if someone reaches out to me for advice how to get better, I&#x2019;m doing it. I can&#x2019;t tell what I said. My secret words.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".sxjy900i68.1.1.0.0.4.1a">He has a thing for greatness. &quot;I&#x2019;m always keepin&#x2019; on other athletes. I love Tom Brady. I love the comparisons with him and Joe Montana. I love Floyd Mayweather&#x2014;the comparisons with him and Muhammad Ali. &#x2019;Ooo, can Floyd Mayweather be the greatest of all time?&#x2019; You know. Things like that. Sidney Crosby and the duel between him and Alex Ovechkin and who&#x2019;s the best, you know. Even to a point where, like, Kyle Korver just broke the three-point record for consecutive games. Like, ninety games straight, he&#x2019;s had a three-point. I was like, &#x2019;Wow, that&#x2019;s crazy.&#x2019; You know, I don&#x2019;t even know that stuff about me until, actually, if I&#x2019;m watching SportsCenter or reading social media. I had no idea that I&#x2019;ve gone this long with scoring consecutive double-digit points until I see... I had no idea. I didn&#x2019;t know what number I was at. I was like, &#x2019;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x2019; I was like, &#x2019;Oh, for real? I got 500 straight double-digit games?&#x2019; Like, it&#x2019;s still in counting now, I&#x2019;m up there with Kareem and Jordan. It&#x2019;s like, sheesh.

People thinking of him as some run-of-the-mill narcissistic asshole would give up, he figured.

Although there is plenty of that. He talks bigger. His responsibility, he says, is to the people in his community who get those words thrown at them: &quot;You&#x2019;ve changed.&quot; People in his own community accusing each other. &quot;It&#x2019;s my responsibility to show them it&#x2019;s not a bad thing to be someone who&#x2019;s changed.

I&#x2019;m not, obviously, I&#x2019;m not no guru on life or guru on success or guru on, you know, huge topics in the world or in America. But I am an example.
