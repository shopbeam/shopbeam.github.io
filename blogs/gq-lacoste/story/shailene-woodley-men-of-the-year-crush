  	    "articleBody": "It\u0027s the end of something. Seriously.\u000A\u000AWhen we get to the park, I say, \u0022Sun or no sun?\u0022 and she says, \u0022Sun, absolutely.\u0022 So we drag a table out of the shade and sit at it. It\u0027s hardly even a park, really. Just a brave little hill of grass next to Manhattan\u0027s West Side Highway, bathed in the sounds of downshifting garbage trucks. On the far side, we can see the boutiqued-up railroad track known as the High Line. Of course she picked sun. Sun is an essential element of her soul. She is part sunlight, part rainbow, part child actor, part TED talk, part ICM agent. This is the Shailene Woodley who told a reporter she enjoys sunbathing naked to \u0022give my vagina a little vitamin D.\u0022 People went nuts about that; it topped the lists of crazy shit that Shailene Woodley said that seemed to proliferate as 2014 went on.\u000A\u000AShe collapses into her chair. She is jet-lagged; she arrived last night from Paris. She\u0027s been in Europe for three weeks, mostly doing Airbnb. She finished filming Insurgent, the second installment of the Divergent series, a month ago, and took off. She says it\u0027s part of the way she maintains a healthy relationship with Hollywood.\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s the thing about me in this industry,\u0022 she says. \u0022I do my thing and then I\u0027m like, \u0027Peace! See you later! I\u0027m going to Europe, where I\u0027m gonna do my own thing!\u0027 You know? So I don\u0027t really interact.\u0022\u000A\u000ABecause I don\u0027t know if you know about it, but Shailene Woodley is a free spirit. She is 23 years old and a multi-millionaire, and she will tell you straight away that she doesn\u0027t have a TV. She doesn\u0027t have a TV because she doesn\u0027t have a house, an apartment, or any permanent-type living arrangement. She has a ten-year-old Prius with 165,000 miles on it. She has a few bos of clothes labeled \u0022summer\u0022 and \u0022winter\u0022 that she packs in a suitcase. There\u0027s also a plastic tub that holds her Vitamix for smoothies and a Crock-Pot for her mushroom tea—and she ships that plastic tub wherever she goes.\u000A\u000A\u0022I have a cell phone now, but I didn\u0027t have one for nine months,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not really a blasting sun, anyway. It\u0027s a syrupy mid-autumn sun that makes you nostalgic for the very moment you\u0027re in, even before it passes. Right now Shailene is only thirty-seven minutes post-sexy-GQ-photo-shoot, and her face still bears the remnants of high-test makeup. She cocks her head to collect some of that sun, and it lights up her eyes; they acquire a kind of aquatic yellowy green depth. There\u0027s a quality to her that\u0027s like one of those hologram baseball cards from cereal bos; look at her one way and she appears normal, almost plain, and then she cocks her head and she doesn\u0027t really look normal anymore. So what about it: Doesn\u0027t it feel like something\u0027s ending? Don\u0027t you feel different from a year ago?\u000A\u000A\u0022Absolutely,\u0022 Shailene says. \u0022I hope I\u0027m different than I was a year ago. I hope I\u0027m different every day!\u0022\u000A\u000ABut come on, Shailene, that\u0027s not what we\u0027re talking about! No one\u0027s asking you whether most of your cells have performed mitosis in the past twelve months. People first became aware of Shailene Woodley when she blew everyone away as George Clooney\u0027s daughter in The Descendants (the film about family and feelings and feeling those feelings under the lush golden sunsets of Hawaii). But this year Shailene Woodley became a movie star. The movies The Fault in Our Stars (the love story about teens with terminal cancer) and Divergent (the new Hunger Games franchise, only with Shailene Woodley) were both hugely successful in a mainstream way and were both sold on the value of having Shailene Woodley in the starring role. People started saying, a lot, that Shailene Woodley is on the Jennifer Lawrence track. (When she was asked about this on late-night television, she said, \u0022As women, we are constantly told that we need to compare ourselves to a girl in school, to our co-workers, to the images in a magazine. How is the world going to advance if we\u0027re always comparing ourselves to others? I admire Jennifer Lawrence, but she\u0027s everyone\u0027s favorite person to compare me to. Is it because we both have short hair and a vagina?\u0022 That part got cut before the show aired. But that\u0027s who Shailene Woodley is, long may she fucking remain so.)\u000A\u000AAnd in those movies that changed her from an actress to a movie star, she played a girl who\u0027s in high school. Shailene is now 23. That is part of what\u0027s ending: She says she got all misty watching The Fault in Our Stars because she knew she would never play another \u0022young adult,\u0022 with or without terminal cancer and a rollie bag of oxygen. She may never lose her virginity before the tear-soaked eyes of America again. But wait.\u000A\u000A\u0022How many times have you lost your virginity, anyway?\u0022 I ask her.\u000A\u000AShe counts on her hands. \u0022Three, four. Four. No, wait. Five!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Five?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Five. The Secret Life of the American Teenager [the blockbuster ABC Family show she starred in for five years], Fault, Divergent, White Bird in a Blizzard [arty film, 2014, by auteur Gregg Araki], The Spectacular Now [2013 teenager movie].\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022I guess people like to watch you lose your innocence?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Ha ha! Apparently!\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd wait, weren\u0027t two of those times with guys in this very magazine? Miles Teller and Ansel Elgort? Who was the superior person to lose your virginity to?\u000A\u000A\u0022Um,\u0022 she says, \u0022both different.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut who smells better?\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s actually a hilarious question, because on Divergent, Ansel used to wear this really awful-smelling deodorant. I joked, \u0027If you book Fault in Our Stars, just don\u0027t wear deodorant.\u0027 He goes, \u0027Yeah, okay. Fine.\u0027 Then he booked it! So I wear this deodorant that I make myself, and I gave him some of that. But he just chose not to wear it—he just wore nothing the whole time. So I guess Ansel smells more pheromone-y and Miles smells more—is delicious an appropriate word to say for a man?\u0022\u000A\u000AIf you\u0027ve seen any of these movies, there\u0027s something strange and hard to place about Shailene Woodley\u0027s presence. She isn\u0027t at all like Jennifer Lawrence, who is kinetic and rhinestone-like. Shailene Woodley is almost heartbreakingly human. She\u0027s like the polar opposite of the Angelina Jolie type. It reduces Shailene\u0027s magical powers to say she\u0027s a girl next door. But Shailene Woodley seems to be able to lug some part of your soul out onto the screen, so that when she experiences something, achieves some success, or feels the weight of her own embarrassing humanity (she\u0027s really good at that), it feels like it\u0027s you that\u0027s all happening to. Watching her star in a movie, it\u0027s like your daughter or your sister or the physician\u0027s assistant at your doctor\u0027s office somehow won the lottery and got to star in a movie. We find it kind of flattering to us that she gets to be famous.\u000A\u000AWe sit quietly for a moment. Another pod of European tourists collapses on the lawn, releasing refugee-level numbers of boutique shopping bags. Shailene does admit, after a while, that the effect of all the press surrounding the release of those movies threatened to change her. To make her feel self-conscious.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah, the weirdest adjustment was to sort of absorb the labeling the press loves to do,\u0022 she says. \u0022Oh, she\u0027s this person or She\u0027s that person.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re the person, I say, who takes mugwort and makes her own deodorant!\u000A\u000A\u0022Yes!\u0022 she says. \u0022I\u0027m the hippie who hugs everyone when they meet me!\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd then I hit on what I was worried about for her. Don\u0027t let people like me ruin you! Don\u0027t let us cynical people make fun of you for waking up in the morning and shouting at the top of your lungs each day, \u0022Good morning! Good morning!\u0022—which is actually a habit of hers. Don\u0027t let us make you dress up like Angelina Jolie all the time!\u000A\u000AInstead of that, I say this: \u0022Don\u0027t ever stop being the lady who brushes her teeth with clay.\u0022\u000A\u000AThen she looks at me kind of like I\u0027m an idiot. \u0022Oh yeah, of course. I would never give anyone else the power to change my personal virtues.\u0022\u000A\u000ADEVIN FRIEDMAN (@devinfriedman) is GQ\u0027s director of editorial projects.",

brushes her teeth with clay and makes her own deodorant. But if you&#39;ve been thinking of the woman who has this year become arguably the most bankable phenom in Hollywood—<em>The Fault in Our Stars, Divergent</em>—as just some 23-year-old hippie who believes in the power of mushroom tea, you&#39;ve been underestimating <strong>Shailene Woodley.</strong> Which is totally fine by her</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.0">It&#x2019;s the end of something. Seriously.</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.1">When we get to the park, I say, &quot;Sun or no sun?&quot; and she says, &quot;Sun, absolutely.&quot; So we drag a table out of the shade and sit at it. It&#x2019;s hardly even a park, really. Just a brave little hill of grass next to Manhattan&#x2019;s West Side Highway, bathed in the sounds of downshifting garbage trucks. On the far side, we can see the boutiqued-up railroad track known as the High Line. Of course she picked sun. Sun is an essential element of her soul. She is part sunlight, part rainbow, part child actor, part TED talk, part ICM agent. This is the Shailene Woodley who told a reporter she enjoys sunbathing naked to &quot;give my vagina a little vitamin D.&quot; People went nuts about that; it topped the lists of <em>crazy shit that Shailene Woodley said</em> that seemed to proliferate as 2014 went on.</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.2">She collapses into her chair. She is jet-lagged; she arrived last night from Paris. She&#x2019;s been in Europe for three weeks, mostly doing Airbnb. She finished filming <em>Insurgent,</em> the second installment of the <em>Divergent</em> series, a month ago, and took off. She says it&#x2019;s part of the way she maintains a healthy relationship with Hollywood.</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.3">&quot;That&#x2019;s the thing about me in this industry,&quot; she says. &quot;I do my thing and then I&#x2019;m like, &#x2019;Peace! See you later! I&#x2019;m going to Europe, where I&#x2019;m gonna do my own thing!&#x2019; You know? So I don&#x2019;t really interact.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.5">Because I don&#x2019;t know if you know about it, but Shailene Woodley is a free spirit. She is 23 years old and a multi-millionaire, and she will tell you straight away that she doesn&#x2019;t have a TV. She doesn&#x2019;t have a TV because she doesn&#x2019;t have a house, an apartment, or any permanent-type living arrangement. She has a ten-year-old Prius with 165,000 miles on it. She has a few bos of clothes labeled &quot;summer&quot; and &quot;winter&quot; that she packs in a suitcase. There&#x2019;s also a plastic tub that holds her Vitamix for smoothies and a Crock-Pot for her mushroom tea&#x2014;and she ships that plastic tub wherever she goes.</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.6">&quot;I have a cell phone now, but I didn&#x2019;t have one for nine months,&quot; she says.</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.7">It&#x2019;s not really a blasting sun, anyway. It&#x2019;s a syrupy mid-autumn sun that makes you nostalgic for the very moment you&#x2019;re in, even before it passes. Right now Shailene is only thirty-seven minutes post-sexy-<em>GQ</em>-photo-shoot, and her face still bears the remnants of high-test makeup. She cocks her head to collect some of that sun, and it lights up her eyes; they acquire a kind of aquatic yellowy green depth. There&#x2019;s a quality to her that&#x2019;s like one of those hologram baseball cards from cereal bos; look at her one way and she appears normal, almost plain, and then she cocks her head and she doesn&#x2019;t really look normal anymore. So what about it: Doesn&#x2019;t it feel like something&#x2019;s ending? Don&#x2019;t you feel different from a year ago?</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.8">&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Shailene says. &quot;I <em>hope</em> I&#x2019;m different than I was a year ago. I hope I&#x2019;m different every day!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.9">But come on, Shailene, that&#x2019;s not what we&#x2019;re talking about! No one&#x2019;s asking you whether most of your cells have performed mitosis in the past twelve months. People first became aware of Shailene Woodley when she blew everyone away as George Clooney&#x2019;s daughter in <em>The Descendants</em> (the film about family and feelings and feeling those feelings under the lush golden sunsets of Hawaii). But this year Shailene Woodley became a movie star. The movies <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> (the love story about teens with terminal cancer) and <em>Divergent</em> (the new <em>Hunger Games</em> franchise, only with Shailene Woodley) were both hugely successful in a mainstream way and were both sold on the value of having Shailene Woodley in the starring role. People started saying, a lot, that Shailene Woodley is on the Jennifer Lawrence track. (When she was asked about this on late-night television, she said, &quot;As women, we are constantly told that we need to compare ourselves to a girl in school, to our co-workers, to the images in a magazine. How is the world going to advance if we&#x2019;re always comparing ourselves to others? I admire Jennifer Lawrence, but she&#x2019;s everyone&#x2019;s favorite person to compare me to. Is it because we both have short hair and a vagina?&quot; That part got cut before the show aired. But that&#x2019;s who Shailene Woodley is, long may she fucking remain so.)</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.a">And in those movies that changed her from an actress to a movie star, she played a girl who&#x2019;s in high school. Shailene is now 23. That is part of what&#x2019;s ending: She says she got all misty watching <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> because she knew she would never play another &quot;young adult,&quot; with or without terminal cancer and a rollie bag of oxygen. She may never lose her virginity before the tear-soaked eyes of America again. But wait.</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.b">&quot;How many times have you lost your virginity, anyway?&quot; I ask her.</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.c">She counts on her hands. &quot;Three, four. Four. No, wait. Five!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.d">&quot;Five?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.e">&quot;Five. <em>The Secret Life of the American Teenager</em> [the blockbuster ABC Family show she starred in for five years], <em>Fault, Divergent, White Bird in a Blizzard</em> [arty film, 2014, by auteur Gregg Araki], <em>The Spectacular Now</em> [2013 teenager movie].&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.f">&quot;I guess people like to watch you lose your innocence?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.g">&quot;Ha ha! Apparently!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.h">And wait, weren&#x2019;t two of those times with guys in this very magazine? Miles Teller and Ansel Elgort? Who was the superior person to lose your virginity to?</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;Um,&quot; she says, &quot;both different.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.j">But who smells better?</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.k"><div class="callout OMFG" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582fa4009f0bee56440bb58/master/w_806/style-2014-12-shailene-woodley-shailene-woodley-gq-magazine-december-2014-moty-03.jpg" alt="style-2014-12-shailene-woodley-shailene-woodley-gq-magazine-december-2014-moty-03.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fshailene-woodley-men-of-the-year-crush&amp;t=style-2014-12-shailene-woodley-shailene-woodley-gq-magazine-december-2014-moty-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fshailene-woodley-men-of-the-year-crush&amp;t=style-2014-12-shailene-woodley-shailene-woodley-gq-magazine-december-2014-moty-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fshailene-woodley-men-of-the-year-crush&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fa4009f0bee56440bb58%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2014-12-shailene-woodley-shailene-woodley-gq-magazine-december-2014-moty-03.jpg&amp;description=style-2014-12-shailene-woodley-shailene-woodley-gq-magazine-december-2014-moty-03.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fshailene-woodley-men-of-the-year-crush&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582fa4009f0bee56440bb58%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2014-12-shailene-woodley-shailene-woodley-gq-magazine-december-2014-moty-03.jpg&amp;description=style-2014-12-shailene-woodley-shailene-woodley-gq-magazine-december-2014-moty-03.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.l">&quot;That&#x2019;s actually a hilarious question, because on <em>Divergent,</em> Ansel used to wear this really awful-smelling deodorant. I joked, &#x2019;If you book <em>Fault in Our Stars,</em> just don&#x2019;t wear deodorant.&#x2019; He goes, &#x2019;Yeah, okay. Fine.&#x2019; Then he booked it! So I wear this deodorant that I make myself, and I gave him some of that. But he just chose not to wear it&#x2014;he just wore nothing the whole time. So I guess Ansel smells more pheromone-y and Miles smells more&#x2014;is <em>delicious</em> an appropriate word to say for a man?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.m">If you&#x2019;ve seen any of these movies, there&#x2019;s something strange and hard to place about Shailene Woodley&#x2019;s presence. She isn&#x2019;t at all like Jennifer Lawrence, who is kinetic and rhinestone-like. Shailene Woodley is almost heartbreakingly human. She&#x2019;s like the polar opposite of the Angelina Jolie type. It reduces Shailene&#x2019;s magical powers to say she&#x2019;s a <em>girl next door.</em> But Shailene Woodley seems to be able to lug some part of <em>your</em> soul out onto the screen, so that when she experiences something, achieves some success, or feels the weight of her own embarrassing humanity (she&#x2019;s really good at that), it feels like it&#x2019;s <em>you</em> that&#x2019;s all happening to. Watching her star in a movie, it&#x2019;s like your daughter or your sister or the physician&#x2019;s assistant at your doctor&#x2019;s office somehow won the lottery and got to star in a movie. We find it kind of flattering to us that she gets to be famous.</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.n">We sit quietly for a moment. Another pod of European tourists collapses on the lawn, releasing refugee-level numbers of boutique shopping bags. Shailene does admit, after a while, that the effect of all the press surrounding the release of those movies threatened to change her. To make her feel self-conscious.</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.o">&quot;Yeah, the weirdest adjustment was to sort of absorb the labeling the press loves to do,&quot; she says. <em>&quot;Oh, she&#x2019;s this person</em> or <em>She&#x2019;s that person.&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.p">You&#x2019;re the person, I say, who takes mugwort and makes her own deodorant!</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.q">&quot;Yes!&quot; she says. &quot;I&#x2019;m the hippie who hugs everyone when they meet me!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.r">And then I hit on what I was worried about for her. Don&#x2019;t let people like me ruin you! Don&#x2019;t let us cynical people make fun of you for waking up in the morning and shouting at the top of your lungs each day, &quot;Good morning! Good morning!&quot;&#x2014;which is actually a habit of hers. Don&#x2019;t let us make you dress up like Angelina Jolie all the time!</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.s">Instead of that, I say this: &quot;Don&#x2019;t ever stop being the lady who brushes her teeth with clay.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1ug60ukq9s0.1.1.0.0.4.t">Then she looks at me kind of like I&#x2019;m an idiot. &quot;Oh yeah, of course.
