  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AGame of Thrones fans, over the first three seasons, have watched Isaac Hempstead-Wright grow from a ten-year-old boy on his first acting job to a fourteen-year-old actor with serious chops. Over the same time period, we&amp;#x2019;ve seen Bran Stark become a major player in the game itself and season three (which arrives on Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital HD today) is only more proof of that. With Game of Thrones&amp;#x2019;fourth season set to premiere on April 6, GQ sat down with the actor to discuss growing up on the show, what&amp;#x2019;s to come for Bran Stark, and his role in Laika&amp;#x2019;s upcoming movie The Boxtrolls.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: What has it been like to grow up on this show?\u000A\u000A Isaac Hempstead-Wright: The show doesn&amp;#x2019;t dominate my life in the way that lots of people think it does. Because I was doing it from so young, it just became this thing I would do in the second half of the year -- a little something that I&amp;#x2019;d do on the side. To see where it&amp;#x2019;s come now from the audition that I did, for this unknown pilot from this series of books, is insane.\u000A\u000AYou were only ten or eleven when you did the pilot. Were you even allowed to watch the show back then?\u000A\u000A It was a process. The violence was very much debunked because you&amp;#x2019;d be walking around on set and there would be decapitated heads or buckets of blood that you&amp;#x2019;d be taking pictures with. [Laughs] So, by the time you watched it, you knew that there was a guy pumping blood out of the body from behind the stone. The sex was a little more difficult, but my mom just gave me equally inappropriate talks of it. [Laughs]\u000A\u000AGQ: What do you think it is about Bran Stark that people love so much?\u000A\u000A I think definitely his mystical element is very intriguing. What&amp;#x2019;s great about the show is that magic isn&amp;#x2019;t this rampant force in the kingdom. It&amp;#x2019;s very much, as it is in our world, a sense that many of the characters are just as skeptical as we would be about dragons or zombies. That makes all the magic in the show not only all the more real, but it also makes all the magic that is there all the more exciting.\u000A\u000AGQ: He&amp;#x2019;s such a strong character with so much perseverance.\u000A\u000A Yeah. I&amp;#x2019;ve often thought how it would be really cool to be one of the fighting people or have a sword, but whilst Bran might not be the most exciting character, he is definitely one of the most true. The obstacles that he&amp;#x2019;s had to overcome &amp;#x2013; like losing his legs and all his family &amp;#x2013; I think are just as difficult (if not more so) than any of the physical battles that any of the other characters have had.\u000A\u000AGQ: Why do you think Bran is steadfast in his belief, and so strong in his will, that he keeps going North even though it&amp;#x2019;s probably not going to end well for them?\u000A\u000A There&amp;#x2019;s this force absolutely driving him from deep within, and I&amp;#x2019;m not even sure if he knows entirely what it is. As he says in season three, &amp;#x201C;I don&amp;#x2019;t want to go. I have to go.&amp;#x201D; It&amp;#x2019;s very much a duty rather than some kind of dream following. It&amp;#x2019;s like a rope pulling him rather than him jumping out into the unknown. Even though I think he knows that where he&amp;#x2019;s going is dangerous, this drive and the final pinnacle at the end makes him forget everything else and just allows him to focus on that.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you guys worry about catching up with George R.R. Martin&amp;#x2019;s books?\u000A\u000A That&amp;#x2019;s interesting you say that because, in season four actually, a lot of the storylines are starting to be either sped up or slowed down and some people are nearly at the end of their storyline and others are way before. I guess it&amp;#x2019;s George&amp;#x2019;s biggest fear, when the show catches up to him, which it inevitably will unless he gets the next book out. But I don&amp;#x2019;t think we&amp;#x2019;re particularly worried about it because David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] know the ending. In a sense, we follow David and Dan rather than the books. It&amp;#x2019;s inevitable that things are going to get left out. In condensing the books, different storylines are made differently. Rather than the books, it&amp;#x2019;s definitely the scripts and the producers for us.\u000A\u000AGQ: Who is your on-set BFF that you hang around the most with?\u000A\u000A I think it&amp;#x2019;s got to be Kristian [Nairn] who plays Hodor. Considering that I&amp;#x2019;m strapped to his back for the entire time, we&amp;#x2019;ve bonded rather well. [Laughs] We&amp;#x2019;re interested in a lot of the same things. We&amp;#x2019;re both gamers and he&amp;#x2019;s got this wonderful sharp, dry sense of humor. When I&amp;#x2019;m always singing him SpongeBob songs or whatever, he&amp;#x2019;s always there. [Laughs]\u000A\u000AGQ: Aside from yourself, who is your favorite Game of Thrones character?\u000A\u000A I actually like Joffrey. [Laughs] Not as a person, but in the sense that he&amp;#x2019;s a very interesting character study because he&amp;#x2019;s this hormonal, crazy teenager who&amp;#x2019;s given absolute power and is corrupted absolutely. It&amp;#x2019;s intriguing to watch him absolutely destroyed from the inside by all of this.\u000A\u000AGQ: What shows do you watch right now that you would love to do a guest spot on?\u000A\u000A Isaac Hempstead-Wright: I love Sherlock. I love Modern Family. I&amp;#x2019;ve got a wide range but, yeah, Sherlock would be so cool.\u000A\u000AGQ: What can you tell me about your role in _The Boxtrolls_?\u000A\u000A Isaac Hempstead-Wright: I play Eggs, who is the protagonist of it. The script has changed lots but the final one now is that it&amp;#x2019;s a story about Eggs who thinks he&amp;#x2019;s a Boxtroll and his friend Fish is taken by these evil people, so the story is about Eggs trying to get Fish back, and he has a lot of adventures on the way.\u000A\u000AGQ: What is your favorite memory, on screen or off, from the work you&amp;#x2019;ve done so far on Game of Thrones?\u000A\u000A One of my first days shooting on Game of Thrones was possibly the coldest day I&amp;#x2019;ve ever experienced in my life, and that sticks out especially because I&amp;#x2019;d never, ever done anything before. To come to Belfast, you expect it to be this glamorous Hollywood film set and it&amp;#x2019;s really this freezing field in Belfast with soaking wet feet and thermals on waiting to go and see some guy get his head chopped off. [Laughs]\u000A\u000A[_Game of Thrones: The Complete Third Season](http://amzn.to/1f4EbJk) arrives on Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital HD today. The show&amp;#x2019;s [fourth season](http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones#/game-of-thrones/index.html) premieres on HBO on April 6 at 9 PM._",

Thrones</em> fans, over the first three seasons, have watched Isaac Hempstead-Wright grow from a ten-year-old boy on his first acting job to a fourteen-year-old actor with serious chops. Over the same time period, we&amp;#x2019;ve seen Bran Stark become a major player in the game itself and season three (which arrives on Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital HD <a href="http://amzn.to/1f4EbJk">today</a>) is only more proof of that. With <em>Game of Thrones</em>&amp;#x2019;fourth season set to premiere on April 6, <a href="../index.html"><em>GQ</em></a> sat down with the actor to discuss growing up on the show, what&amp;#x2019;s to come for Bran Stark, and his role in Laika&amp;#x2019;s upcoming movie <em>The Boxtrolls</em>.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.2"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>GQ: What has it been like to grow up on this show?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>Isaac Hempstead-Wright: </strong>The show doesn&amp;#x2019;t dominate my life in the way that lots of people think it does. Because I was doing it from so young, it just became this thing I would do in the second half of the year -- a little something that I&amp;#x2019;d do on the side. To see where it&amp;#x2019;s come now from the audition that I did, for this unknown pilot from this series of books, is insane.</p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>You were only ten or eleven when you did the pilot. Were you even allowed to watch the show back then?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.7"> It was a process. The violence was very much debunked because you&amp;#x2019;d be walking around on set and there would be decapitated heads or buckets of blood that you&amp;#x2019;d be taking pictures with. [Laughs] So, by the time you watched it, you knew that there was a guy pumping blood out of the body from behind the stone. The sex was a little more difficult, but my mom just gave me equally inappropriate talks of it. [Laughs]</p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>GQ: What do you think it is about Bran Stark that people love so much?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.9"> I think definitely his mystical element is very intriguing. What&amp;#x2019;s great about the show is that magic isn&amp;#x2019;t this rampant force in the kingdom. It&amp;#x2019;s very much, as it is in our world, a sense that many of the characters are just as skeptical as we would be about dragons or zombies. That makes all the magic in the show not only all the more real, but it also makes all the magic that is there all the more exciting.</p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>GQ: He&amp;#x2019;s such a strong character with so much perseverance.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.b"> Yeah. I&amp;#x2019;ve often thought how it would be really cool to be one of the fighting people or have a sword, but whilst Bran might not be the most exciting character, he is definitely one of the most true. The obstacles that he&amp;#x2019;s had to overcome &amp;#x2013; like losing his legs and all his family &amp;#x2013; I think are just as difficult (if not more so) than any of the physical battles that any of the other characters have had.</p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>GQ: Why do you think Bran is steadfast in his belief, and so strong in his will, that he keeps going North even though it&amp;#x2019;s probably not going to end well for them?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.d"> There&amp;#x2019;s this force absolutely driving him from deep within, and I&amp;#x2019;m not even sure if he knows entirely what it is. As he says in season three, &amp;#x201C;I don&amp;#x2019;t want to go. I have to go.&amp;#x201D; It&amp;#x2019;s very much a duty rather than some kind of dream following. It&amp;#x2019;s like a rope pulling him rather than him jumping out into the unknown. Even though I think he knows that where he&amp;#x2019;s going is dangerous, this drive and the final pinnacle at the end makes him forget everything else and just allows him to focus on that.</p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>GQ: Do you guys worry about catching up with George R.R. Martin&amp;#x2019;s books?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.f"> That&amp;#x2019;s interesting you say that because, in season four actually, a lot of the storylines are starting to be either sped up or slowed down and some people are nearly at the end of their storyline and others are way before. I guess it&amp;#x2019;s George&amp;#x2019;s biggest fear, when the show catches up to him, which it inevitably will unless he gets the next book out. But I don&amp;#x2019;t think we&amp;#x2019;re particularly worried about it because David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] know the ending. In a sense, we follow David and Dan rather than the books. It&amp;#x2019;s inevitable that things are going to get left out. In condensing the books, different storylines are made differently. Rather than the books, it&amp;#x2019;s definitely the scripts and the producers for us.</p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>GQ: Who is your on-set BFF that you hang around the most with?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.h"> I think it&amp;#x2019;s got to be Kristian [Nairn] who plays Hodor. Considering that I&amp;#x2019;m strapped to his back for the entire time, we&amp;#x2019;ve bonded rather well. [Laughs] We&amp;#x2019;re interested in a lot of the same things. We&amp;#x2019;re both gamers and he&amp;#x2019;s got this wonderful sharp, dry sense of humor. When I&amp;#x2019;m always singing him SpongeBob songs or whatever, he&amp;#x2019;s always there. [Laughs]</p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>GQ: Aside from yourself, who is your favorite <em>Game of Thrones</em> character?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.j"> I actually like Joffrey. [Laughs] Not as a person, but in the sense that he&amp;#x2019;s a very interesting character study because he&amp;#x2019;s this hormonal, crazy teenager who&amp;#x2019;s given absolute power and is corrupted absolutely. It&amp;#x2019;s intriguing to watch him absolutely destroyed from the inside by all of this.</p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>GQ: What shows do you watch right now that you would love to do a guest spot on?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.l"> <strong>Isaac Hempstead-Wright: </strong>I love Sherlock. I love Modern Family. I&amp;#x2019;ve got a wide range but, yeah, Sherlock would be so cool.</p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>GQ: What can you tell me about your role in </strong><a href="http://www.theboxtrolls.com/"><strong>_The Boxtrolls</strong>_</a><strong>?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.n"> <strong>Isaac Hempstead-Wright: </strong>I play Eggs, who is the protagonist of it. The script has changed lots but the final one now is that it&amp;#x2019;s a story about Eggs who thinks he&amp;#x2019;s a Boxtroll and his friend Fish is taken by these evil people, so the story is about Eggs trying to get Fish back, and he has a lot of adventures on the way.</p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>GQ: What is your favorite memory, on screen or off, from the work you&amp;#x2019;ve done so far on <em>Game of Thrones</em>?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".kj76bmuw3k.1.1.0.0.4.p"> One of my first days shooting on Game of Thrones was possibly the coldest day I&amp;#x2019;ve ever experienced in my life, and that sticks out especially because I&amp;#x2019;d never, ever done anything before. To come to Belfast, you expect it to be this glamorous Hollywood film set and it&amp;#x2019;s really this freezing field in Belfast with soaking wet feet and thermals on waiting to go and see some guy get his head chopped off.
