  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThis story was written under the influence of caffeine in numerous forms, as well as Nawgan&amp;#xAE;, a new \u0022refreshing beverage\u0022 designed by a brain scientist to promote concentration, and—once or twice—a pharmaceutical concocted for narcoleptics that comes in handy when you have to be coherent even on days when your 2-year-old is clamoring at 4 a.m. for milk and \u0022\u0027artoons!\u0022\u000A\u000A Whether your problem is an ornery toddler or an overly boozy night, every honest man in America who isn\u0027t Tony Robbins knows the feeling of losing steam until he is an Internet-trolling zombie by 3 p.m. The secret to having more energy isn\u0027t just a matter of righting those wrongs. It\u0027s a mix of proper sleep, better diet, and managing—but not eliminating—stress. What follows is a day in the life of your energy.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Before you take that bite, remember: Nothing is as\u000A\u000Acrash-inducing as processed carbs.\u000A\u000AMorning\u000A\u000A A few ground rules for food, starting with breakfast.\u000A\u000A First things first: Pacing your caloric intake is the best way to maintain energy \u0022so that you don\u0027t have to overeat or undereat, and the body has the amount of energy it needs,\u0022 says Susan Roberts, the senior scientist at the Energy Metabolism Lab at Tufts University. Roberts\u0027s job is to obsess over food and diet and how these things relate to health. Her basic message: Find a way to avoid hunger. Which is to say: Don\u0027t eat crap. \u0022If you eat soda and Twinkies, you will get hungrier,\u0022 Roberts says. That\u0027s because these foods are engineered to make us crave them, and they\u0027re composed of highly processed sugars that are easily burned up, resulting in the famous crash any afternoon cookie-snacker knows all too well.\u000A\u000A Much of what Roberts encourages is the message we\u0027re hearing all over the media, from authors and farmers and chefs and guys in fedoras riding Big Wheels around Brooklyn: Eat whole foods whenever possible. And yet, Roberts says, \u0022something like 85 percent of all food we eat has gone through a food manufacturer. We\u0027ve all been trained to eat processed foods. Developing a liking for whole foods overnight is difficult; you have to retrain your brain.\u0022\u000A\u000A The Shortcut:\u000A\u000A Can\u0027t I just take a pill?\u000A\u000A We know what to eat. When should we eat it? Is breakfast really the most -important meal of the day? \u0022A whole bunch of studies show that people who eat breakfast do better managing their weight than people who skip it,\u0022 Roberts says. \u0022Salad-bar people, breakfast-skippers—by 3 p.m., their bodies are ravenous. The body is craving sugar and calories; you\u0027re in starvation mode, essentially.\u0022 And to remedy that, the body is drawn to foods that most readily resupply calories. It\u0027ll lure you toward foods built from the toxic stew of refined carbs and fat—foods that are engineered to be calorically dense. \u0022Your energy level over the day isn\u0027t just total nutritional content,\u0022 Roberts says. \u0022It\u0027s about calories, and pushing some of them earlier in the day is a good way to maintain energy levels.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Power Players: George Lois\u000A\u000A One of the most     productive ad men    of all time\u000A\u000A\u0022Energy begets   energy. If you\u0027re   dragging, start   moving.\u000A\u000AGet up   and get active.   Before you   know it, you\u0027re   hustling.\u000A\u000A You\u0027re   excited.\u0022\u000A\u000A6:30 a.m.\u000A\u000AYou are a morning person. *The earlier you wake up, the higher your levels of cortisol, better known as the stress hormone. This chemical can raise focus and productivity—especially if you learn how to harness it. (See \u0022Embrace Anxiety.\u0022)\u000A\u000A7:30 a.m.\u000A\u000ALet the sunshine in. *Linger in the driveway as you pick up the newspaper, or drink your coffee in the yard. Being out in the sun (or at least in daylight) helps signal the brain to cut off the production of melatonin, the chemical that makes us drowsy.\u000A\u000A10 a.m.\u000A\u000AGo time. \u000A\u000A Ignore the e-mail; postpone your website grazing. That dude enthusiastically retelling the story of his \u0022amazing night\u0022? Kick him out of your office. Your natural circadian rhythms and the boost of energy from a solid breakfast (not McGriddles) make this one of your most productive hours, so it\u0027s an excellent time to actually, you know, work.\u000A\u000A10:30 a.m.\u000A\u000ACaffeine maintenance. *Here\u0027s the thing: Coffee is fine. Even sleep experts drink it. But it\u0027s a stimulant that is best used in moderation, so any nutritionist you ask will tell you to keep it reasonable. Go with smaller cups—four to six ounces each—and space them out across the day, like the Europeans do with espresso.FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAll Day\u000A\u000A Eat like a much smaller mammal.\u000A\u000A Roberts recommends three small meals and two snacks—\u0022but small snacks.\u0022 The meals should serve as the three points during a day \u0022when your tummy is full and you\u0027re feeling satisfied. That\u0027s important; we\u0027re hardwired to feel full.\u0022 The purpose of the snacks, she says, is to curb cravings—not to fill you up but to tide you over. An apple, for instance, works well. Or cheese sticks, because protein is more filling.\u000A\u000A As for what not to eat: \u0022The ideal diet is one that gets rid of unsatisfying stuff,\u0022 Roberts says. Sugar is obvious. \u0022But one of the worst things would be white carbohydrates,\u0022 she says, such as white bread and rice. \u0022Sugar is hunger-promoting, but white carbs are less good for all kinds of reasons.\u0022 They\u0027re less healthy, have fewer vitamins and minerals, and worst of all, encourage cravings. Wheat bread doesn\u0027t actually have less sugar—it\u0027s a wash on the glycemic index—but it has \u0022a whole lot more fiber,\u0022 and that is the difference maker. \u0022In the minute of that meal, it might not matter. But fiber has long-term benefits,\u0022 she says.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Power Players: Tony Schwartz\u000A\u000A Consultant, CEO of the Energy Project\u000A\u000A\u0022Humans can\u0027t operate nonstop like computers. We\u0027re\u000A\u000A designed to pulse between activities. Work in ninety-\u000A\u000Aminute bursts.You\u0027ll get more done in less time.\u0022\u000A\u000A Fiber also explains why it\u0027s so much better to get sugars from fruit, as opposed to sweets, and why it\u0027s always better to actually eat the fruit instead of getting it blended down into a smoothie. The latter is far superior to a Snickers, obviously, but eating the fruit whole makes the body work harder to break down the food and take advantage of the calories. \u0022An apple is bulky. It has textural constraints,\u0022 Roberts explains, in the way only a scientist can. \u0022The lumps of apple that arrive in your stomach with pieces of skin [on them] have cells that have to be broken down. Fruit itself has barriers to instant use.\u0022 By making your body labor to digest the fiber, the energy is more slowly portioned out.\u000A\u000A12:30 p.m.\u000A\u000AThe things that look best are the worst for you. \u000A\u000A Sorry, but if you crave it, it\u0027s probably bad. If you actually want to be conscious after lunch, try a grilled-chicken sandwich and a spinach salad (which is loaded with fatigue-fighting iron). You can never go wrong with fish (unless it\u0027s deep-fried and served as sticks) or a turkey chili that\u0027s thick with beans, which provide a slow drip of fuel over the course of an afternoon, thanks to a healthy balance of protein and carbohydrates.\u000A\u000AThe Workday\u000A\u000A Embrace anxiety.\u000A\u000A That visceral, almost hyper feeling you get during periods of extreme focus and productivity? That\u0027s anxiety. And according to T. Byram Karasu, psychiatrist in chief at Montefiore Medical Center and the go-to headshrinker for CEOs in New York City, it\u0027s good for you. Karasu tries to help his patients achieve a \u0022high-adrenaline, low-endorphin\u0022 state that, he says, \u0022is the opposite of what people suggest you do in life to be happy and serene.\u0022 Such a blissed-out state \u0022takes away the productive high-power energy\u0022 that many of us associate with extreme focus and mental energy. The idea of encouraging anxiety is more than a little counterintuitive—and surely quite troubling to neurotics—but it makes sense if you think about it. Have you ever felt almost tingly when working at a high level? The danger, Karasu warns, is that if this is the case, you are teetering very close to a physiological threshold. \u0022At a certain level it becomes paralyzing,\u0022 he says, and the body goes into anxiety overload—cortisol, the stress hormone, is released in massive quantities and we enter the fight-or-ight state. At this point, anxiety becomes fear and all systems basically shut down; your computer freezes up.\u000A\u000A The extreme focus that Karasu teaches only works with people who have a high tolerance for this stimulus and are able to capitalize on the adrenaline being pumped through the body: \u0022No one without high tolerance to anxiety can succeed at a high level.\u0022\u000A\u000A1 p.m.\u000A\u000A Dude, drink. \u000A\u000A Dehydration is one of the leading causes of afternoon doldrums—or of shitty feelings anytime—because it decreases blood ow and, therefore, oxygen to the brain. Technically you should be hydrating throughout the day—thirteen cups a day for an average guy. The upside of all that water is you\u0027ll have to get up and move to the restroom more often, and moving is good.\u000A\u000A2 p.m.\u000A\u000ARise, young soldier. *Any amount of aerobic ercise can improve concentration by activating brain chemicals like dopamine. There\u0027s an increasingly popular school of thought that we\u0027re only truly effective in bursts and that office workers should be encouraged to take breaks, even if that means leaving the building to go to the gym for a workout. If you only have a half hour, try interval training. Recent studies have shown that extremely intense short-burst ercise (even ten minutes\u0027 worth) can be as effective as a long run—you get the same health benefits and the endorphin high.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Power Players: Jim Cramer\u000A\u000A Screams for five hours a day on CNBC\u000A\u000A\u0022I CAN\u0027T STAY ASLEEP. I wake up revved and work out\u000A\u000A intensely for an hour. Don\u0027t be an idiot. Get more sleep than\u000A\u000A I do.\u0022\u000A\u000A3 p.m.\u000A\u000A NASA says: Nap! \u000A\u000A The average circadian rhythm hits a low at two points in the day: 3 a.m. and 3 p.m. Hence, the afternoon slump. If you have a door or your boss is a progressive type, consider a rest. Even short naps are proven to fight fatigue and increase focus. A NASA study of long-haul airline pilots showed that those who napped for at least twenty-six minutes improved their reaction time by 16 percent, while those who didn\u0027t had a 34 percent deterioration.\u000A\u000A4:30 p.m.\u000A\u000AEat an apple. *\u000A\u000A5 to 6 p.m.\u000A\u000A If you didn\u0027t do it earlier, work out now. \u000A\u000A Your body temperature typically peaks in the early evening, so your muscles are literally at their warmest now. And according to Karasu, \u0022the machine has to be well maintained.\u0022 For this, he insists on regular intense ercise, which he defines as the ability to run 6.7 miles per hour for twenty minutes.\u000A\u000A6 p.m.\u000A\u000AA beer or two is fine, but more and your sleep is screwed. \u000A\u000A Orfeu Buxton, Ph.D., an assistant professor in the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, has an interesting explanation for why chronic insomniacs and burners of both candle ends are often grumpy and short-tempered. It isn\u0027t just that they\u0027re tired and thus irritable. Rather, the irritation comes from not experiencing enough REM sleep (or dream sleep), a brain function that helps a person \u0022deal with emotions that come up during the day. In absence of sleep, that doesn\u0027t occur.\u0022 And the result, he says, is a kind of \u0022post-traumatic stress disorder\u0022 that can adversely affect how you interact with others. One of the main disrupters of REM sleep? Too much alcohol, which can also disrupt slow-wave sleep that precedes REM sleep. More than half the entire day\u0027s growth hormone is released during the slow-wave period, and \u0022that accelerates aging if you don\u0027t get it.\u0022 And, of course, you\u0027ll feel generally more sluggish.\u000A\u000APost-work\u000A\u000A \u0022Stress-train\u0022 your brain.\u000A\u000A You remember how we told you anxiety can be a good thing? Well, you should also remember that it only works if you have a high tolerance for it. Fortunately, you can raise your anxiety threshold. Coaches of top athletes, like Andy Walshe, an Aussie-born performance expert at Red Bull, are starting to use \u0022stress-training\u0022 to do just this. Walshe says he\u0027s lately been taking athletes way out of their comfort zones—by, say, making golfers do surf-survival school (really)—to teach them how to elevate their tolerance to stress and capitalize on the adrenaline, rather than letting it blow past the threshold into anxiety. You don\u0027t want to be in a situation where you\u0027re uncomfortable all the time, but you need to push yourself out to the edge a couple of times to see how much you can handle. One of the best ways to do this, Walshe says, is trying something you\u0027re afraid of. \u0022The number one fear of Westerners, worse than death, is public speaking,\u0022 he says. \u0022It builds anxiety and heart rate.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A If you learn to channel it, mild anxiety is a surefire energy\u000A\u000A source.\u000A\u000A The primal explanation for all this, explains Dean MacKinnon, M.D., an associate professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, is that the inner regions of the brain are waiting to kick in and assist us by providing jolts of the neurotransmitters adrenaline and norepinephrine. In caveman times, the idea was to help us, say, chase and catch prey or recognize and run from an angry mammoth. Today, we can understand these things in the cool, detached verbiage of science. When fight-or-ight happens, we\u0027re shifting from \u0022tonic arousal\u0022 to \u0022phasic arousal,\u0022 and the more you\u0027re in the latter state, the more \u0022alert\u0022 you\u0027ll feel, MacKinnon explains.\u000A\u000A7 p.m.\u000A\u000AEat light—also, early. \u000A\u000A Dinner should be small and at least three hours prior to sleep. Your body needs that much time to process solids and avoid acid reux. Load up on greens and lean proteins.\u000A\u000A 10 p.m.\u000A\u000AWhat about nooky? \u000A\u000A Karasu, the energy guru, is firm on this: \u0022Indulging in sexuality…will lower testosterone and create laziness in the body.\u0022 Wait—what? \u0022Once or twice a week is okay,\u0022 but \u0022no promiscuity.\u0022 If you\u0027re thinking that such an ascetic regimen is likely not well received by his roster of clients—CEOs, celebrities, Masters of the Universe—you\u0027re right. \u0022They say, \u0027Fuck you!\u0027\u0022 Karasu says, and laughs as only a man who charges $1,000 per hour can. \u0022They usually come around, by the way.\u0022\u000A\u000ANight\u000A\u000A You\u0027re sleeping wrong.\u000A\u000A If someone were to ask you how much sleep is enough, chances are you\u0027d answer, \u0022Eight hours.\u0022 That response has always been the numerical equivalent of a good night\u0027s sleep. But Buxton, the Harvard sleep expert, thinks we need to change the conversation. There\u0027s only one rule that will ensure that you\u0027ve slept enough to fully function: You need to be able to wake up under your own power and feel rested. \u0022If you can get up at the same time each day without an alarm clock and it\u0027s pleasant—that\u0027s important—then you\u0027re getting enough sleep,\u0022 he says. Every person will need to tinker with bedtimes to arrive at the right number of hours, and it varies by person (see Jim Cramer, above), but it\u0027s somewhere between seven and nine hours. That number, it turns out, is genetically ifluenced and is \u0022not likely to change dramatically unless you have an illness or unusual pain, anxiety, or stress.\u0022 (Buxton\u0027s is seven hours forty-five minutes.)\u000A\u000A Sleep isn\u0027t just important because a lack of it causes us to feel drowsy, lethargic, and run-down. \u0022It\u0027s during sleep that the body recovers,\u0022 Buxton says, and the payoff of that can be increased mental and physical energy. A sleep-deprived brain will be weak in the areas of \u0022ecutive function\u0022—creativity and decision-making—and while you can still learn \u0022explicit things,\u0022 Buxton explains, you will not be able to experience as many \u0022implicit learning moments.\u0022 These are the aha! moments when \u0022there\u0027s a pattern that\u0027s not completely obvious and then suddenly you see it.\u0022 What\u0027s more, sleep debt can prevent the brain from converting short-term memories to long-term memories and, as your grandmother said, really does elevate your risk of getting sick. Buxton cites \u0022some very elegant studies where they make people sniff rhinovirus\u0022 that showed that people who sleep less are far more likely to develop colds. So, final lesson: Sleep more, which really means go to bed earlier.\u000A\u000AJosh Dean wrote about killer desk jobs in the October 2011 issue of GQ.",

Roberts&#x2019;s job is to obsess over food and diet and how these things relate to health. Her basic message: Find a way to avoid hunger. Which is to say: Don&#x2019;t eat crap. &quot;If you eat soda and Twinkies, you will get hungrier,&quot; Roberts says. That&#x2019;s because these foods are engineered to make us crave them, and they&#x2019;re composed of highly processed sugars that are easily burned up, resulting in the famous crash any afternoon cookie-snacker knows all too well.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.b"> Much of what Roberts encourages is the message we&#x2019;re hearing all over the media, from authors and farmers and chefs and guys in fedoras riding Big Wheels around Brooklyn: Eat whole foods whenever possible. And yet, Roberts says, &quot;something like 85 percent of all food we eat has gone through a food manufacturer. We&#x2019;ve all been trained to eat processed foods. Developing a liking for whole foods overnight is difficult; you have to retrain your brain.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.c"> <em>The Shortcut:</em></p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.d"> <a href="http://www.gq.com/how-to/rest-of-your-life/201205/nature-journal-energy-pill-side-effects">Can&#x2019;t I just take a pill?</a></p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.e"> We know what to eat. When should we eat it? Is breakfast really the most -important meal of the day? &quot;A whole bunch of studies show that people who eat breakfast do better managing their weight than people who skip it,&quot; Roberts says. &quot;Salad-bar people, breakfast-skippers&#x2014;by 3 p.m., their bodies are ravenous. The body is craving sugar and calories; you&#x2019;re in starvation mode, essentially.&quot; And to remedy that, the body is drawn to foods that most readily resupply calories. It&#x2019;ll lure you toward foods built from the toxic stew of refined carbs and fat&#x2014;foods that are engineered to be calorically dense. &quot;Your energy level over the day isn&#x2019;t just total nutritional content,&quot; Roberts says. &quot;It&#x2019;s about calories, and pushing some of them earlier in the day is a good way to maintain energy levels.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.f"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582f4533655c24c6c952e00/master/w_806/how-to-2012-05-energy-package-george-lois-300x430.jpg" alt="how-to-2012-05-energy-package-george-lois-300x430.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhigh-energy-fitness-plan-strategy&amp;t=how-to-2012-05-energy-package-george-lois-300x430.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhigh-energy-fitness-plan-strategy&amp;t=how-to-2012-05-energy-package-george-lois-300x430.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhigh-energy-fitness-plan-strategy&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f4533655c24c6c952e00%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhow-to-2012-05-energy-package-george-lois-300x430.jpg&amp;description=how-to-2012-05-energy-package-george-lois-300x430.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhigh-energy-fitness-plan-strategy&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f4533655c24c6c952e00%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhow-to-2012-05-energy-package-george-lois-300x430.jpg&amp;description=how-to-2012-05-energy-package-george-lois-300x430.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.g"> <strong>Power Players: George Lois</strong></p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.h"> <em>One of the most     productive ad men    of all time</em></p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;Energy begets   energy.

That&#x2019;s important; we&#x2019;re hardwired to feel full.&quot; The purpose of the snacks, she says, is to curb cravings&#x2014;not to fill you up but to tide you over.

Sugar is obvious. &quot;But one of the worst things would be white carbohydrates,&quot; she says, such as white bread and rice. &quot;Sugar is hunger-promoting, but white carbs are less good for all kinds of reasons.&quot; They&#x2019;re less healthy, have fewer vitamins and minerals, and worst of all, encourage cravings. Wheat bread doesn&#x2019;t actually have less sugar&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a wash on the glycemic index&#x2014;but it has &quot;a whole lot more fiber,&quot; and that is the difference maker. &quot;In the minute of that meal, it might not matter.

That&#x2019;s anxiety. And according to T. Byram Karasu, psychiatrist in chief at Montefiore Medical Center and the go-to headshrinker for CEOs in New York City, it&#x2019;s good for you. Karasu tries to help his patients achieve a &quot;high-adrenaline, low-endorphin&quot; state that, he says, &quot;is the opposite of what people suggest you do in life to be happy and serene.&quot; Such a blissed-out state &quot;takes away the productive high-power energy&quot; that many of us associate with extreme focus and mental energy. The idea of encouraging anxiety is more than a little counterintuitive&#x2014;and surely quite troubling to neurotics&#x2014;but it makes sense if you think about it. Have you ever felt almost tingly when working at a high level? The danger, Karasu warns, is that if this is the case, you are teetering very close to a physiological threshold. &quot;At a certain level it becomes paralyzing,&quot; he says, and the body goes into anxiety overload&#x2014;cortisol, the stress hormone, is released in massive quantities and we enter the fight-or-ight state. At this point, anxiety becomes fear and all systems basically shut down; your computer freezes up.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> The extreme focus that Karasu teaches only works with people who have a high tolerance for this stimulus and are able to capitalize on the adrenaline being pumped through the body: &quot;No one without high tolerance to anxiety can succeed at a high level.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.1c">1 p.m.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> <em>Dude, drink. </em></p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> Dehydration is one of the leading causes of afternoon doldrums&#x2014;or of shitty feelings anytime&#x2014;because it decreases blood ow and, therefore, oxygen to the brain.

It isn&#x2019;t just that they&#x2019;re tired and thus irritable. Rather, the irritation comes from not experiencing enough REM sleep (or dream sleep), a brain function that helps a person &quot;deal with emotions that come up during the day. In absence of sleep, that doesn&#x2019;t occur.&quot; And the result, he says, is a kind of &quot;post-traumatic stress disorder&quot; that can adversely affect how you interact with others. One of the main disrupters of REM sleep? Too much alcohol, which can also disrupt slow-wave sleep that precedes REM sleep. More than half the entire day&#x2019;s growth hormone is released during the slow-wave period, and &quot;that accelerates aging if you don&#x2019;t get it.&quot; And, of course, you&#x2019;ll feel generally more sluggish.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.1y">Post-work</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.1z"> &quot;Stress-train&quot; your brain.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.20"> You remember how we told you anxiety can be a good thing? Well, you should also remember that it only works if you have a high tolerance for it. Fortunately, you can raise your anxiety threshold. Coaches of top athletes, like Andy Walshe, an Aussie-born performance expert at Red Bull, are starting to use &quot;stress-training&quot; to do just this. Walshe says he&#x2019;s lately been taking athletes way out of their comfort zones&#x2014;by, say, making golfers do surf-survival school (really)&#x2014;to teach them how to elevate their tolerance to stress and capitalize on the adrenaline, rather than letting it blow past the threshold into anxiety. You don&#x2019;t want to be in a situation where you&#x2019;re uncomfortable all the time, but you need to push yourself out to the edge a couple of times to see how much you can handle. One of the best ways to do this, Walshe says, is trying something you&#x2019;re afraid of. &quot;The number one fear of Westerners, worse than death, is public speaking,&quot; he says. &quot;It builds anxiety and heart rate.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.21"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582f45209f0bee56440a218/master/w_806/how-to-2012-05-energy-package-anxiety-300x430.jpg" alt="how-to-2012-05-energy-package-anxiety-300x430.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhigh-energy-fitness-plan-strategy&amp;t=how-to-2012-05-energy-package-anxiety-300x430.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhigh-energy-fitness-plan-strategy&amp;t=how-to-2012-05-energy-package-anxiety-300x430.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhigh-energy-fitness-plan-strategy&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f45209f0bee56440a218%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhow-to-2012-05-energy-package-anxiety-300x430.jpg&amp;description=how-to-2012-05-energy-package-anxiety-300x430.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhigh-energy-fitness-plan-strategy&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f45209f0bee56440a218%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhow-to-2012-05-energy-package-anxiety-300x430.jpg&amp;description=how-to-2012-05-energy-package-anxiety-300x430.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.22"> If you learn to channel it, mild anxiety is a surefire energy</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.23"> source.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.24"> The primal explanation for all this, explains Dean MacKinnon, M.D., an associate professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, is that the inner regions of the brain are waiting to kick in and assist us by providing jolts of the neurotransmitters adrenaline and norepinephrine.

When fight-or-ight happens, we&#x2019;re shifting from &quot;tonic arousal&quot; to &quot;phasic arousal,&quot; and the more you&#x2019;re in the latter state, the more &quot;alert&quot; you&#x2019;ll feel, MacKinnon explains.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.25">7 p.m.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.26"><em>Eat light&#x2014;also, early. </em></p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.27"> Dinner should be small and at least three hours prior to sleep.

Load up on greens and lean proteins.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.28"> 10 p.m.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.29"><em>What about nooky? </em></p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.2a"> Karasu, the energy guru, is firm on this: &quot;Indulging in sexuality&#x2026;will lower testosterone and create laziness in the body.&quot; Wait&#x2014;what? &quot;Once or twice a week is okay,&quot; but &quot;no promiscuity.&quot; If you&#x2019;re thinking that such an ascetic regimen is likely not well received by his roster of clients&#x2014;CEOs, celebrities, Masters of the Universe&#x2014;you&#x2019;re right. &quot;They say, &#x2019;Fuck you!&#x2019;&quot; Karasu says, and laughs as only a man who charges $1,000 per hour can. &quot;They usually come around, by the way.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.2b">Night</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.2c"> You&#x2019;re sleeping wrong.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.2d"> If someone were to ask you how much sleep is enough, chances are you&#x2019;d answer, &quot;Eight hours.&quot; That response has always been the numerical equivalent of a good night&#x2019;s sleep. But Buxton, the Harvard sleep expert, thinks we need to change the conversation. There&#x2019;s only one rule that will ensure that you&#x2019;ve slept enough to fully function: You need to be able to wake up under your own power and feel rested. &quot;If you can get up at the same time each day without an alarm clock and it&#x2019;s pleasant&#x2014;that&#x2019;s important&#x2014;then you&#x2019;re getting enough sleep,&quot; he says. Every person will need to tinker with bedtimes to arrive at the right number of hours, and it varies by person (see Jim Cramer, above), but it&#x2019;s somewhere between seven and nine hours. That number, it turns out, is genetically ifluenced and is &quot;not likely to change dramatically unless you have an illness or unusual pain, anxiety, or stress.&quot; (Buxton&#x2019;s is seven hours forty-five minutes.)</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.2e"> Sleep isn&#x2019;t just important because a lack of it causes us to feel drowsy, lethargic, and run-down. &quot;It&#x2019;s during sleep that the body recovers,&quot; Buxton says, and the payoff of that can be increased mental and physical energy. A sleep-deprived brain will be weak in the areas of &quot;ecutive function&quot;&#x2014;creativity and decision-making&#x2014;and while you can still learn &quot;explicit things,&quot; Buxton explains, you will not be able to experience as many &quot;implicit learning moments.&quot; These are the aha! moments when &quot;there&#x2019;s a pattern that&#x2019;s not completely obvious and then suddenly you see it.&quot; What&#x2019;s more, sleep debt can prevent the brain from converting short-term memories to long-term memories and, as your grandmother said, really does elevate your risk of getting sick. Buxton cites &quot;some very elegant studies where they make people sniff rhinovirus&quot; that showed that people who sleep less are far more likely to develop colds. So, final lesson: Sleep more, which really means go to bed earlier.</p><p data-reactid=".20wl84nsem8.1.1.0.0.4.2f"><em>Josh Dean wrote about <a
