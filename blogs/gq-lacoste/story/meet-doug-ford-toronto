  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AOne frigid day last winter, I had a long hot cup of coffee with Rob Ford\u0027s older brother Doug, who\u0027s now trying to finish the job his charismatic, crack-smoking sibling could not. Who the hell is this crazy DoFo? And could be actually win?\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AUntil last week, it seemed that no matter how fucked up the story got, and it took some hairy turns, it was impossible that anything could stop Rob Ford. In a twisted version of Greasers vs. Socs, the downtown liberals up here in Toronto were freaking out because our mayor was (still) a fat, glow-in-the-dark white guy from the \u0027burbs while the Ford Nation diehards couldn\u0027t stop gloating that the elites were (still) getting their smarmy asses handed to them. Not only was RoFo still standing, he was gaining on John Tory, the leader in the mayoral race.\u000A\u000AIn the end, it wasn\u0027t the crack video that looked like an episode of A&amp;E\u0027s Intervention that put RoFo on the mat. Or the late-night drunken rant at a fast food joint, or the bear tackle of a female councilor at City Hall, or the celebrity style stint in rehab, or even the best comment about cunnilingus since Tony Soprano lamented the unfortunate intersection between psychiatry and eating pussy. After all the larger than life, crazy-ass, catch me if you can shit, it was the cruelly ordinary \u0022abdominal mass\u0022 that interrupted the most epic mayoral election in Toronto\u0027s history. Last Thursday, after Ford\u0027s doctors biopsied his tumor, Ford withdrew from the race and for about 20 minutes, Torontonians played nice again. Most people in the city wished him well, including his harshest critics, until the next day when his big brother Doug took his place on the ballot and the city went into spasms of outrage, again.\u000A\u000ADoug Ford has been part of this Daliesque sideshow from the beginning. He ran his brother\u0027s 2010 campaign and took over his city council seat when RoFo upgraded to mayor. He stood by his brother through denials, confessions, failed attempts at sobriety and rehab. DoFo is four years older than Rob with a much quieter life. He married young, 23, and was a father to four girls before he was 30. Since hitching his wagon to Rob, he\u0027s taken more than a few nut punches from the media. He\u0027s been compared to Dick Cheney and the dumb guy in Dumb and Dumber. He has been called Etobicoke\u0027s very own Pablo Escobar for allegedly dealing hash in the 80\u0027s. Some consider him trailer trash pretending to be a Kennedy; others a Kennedy pretending to be trailer trash. Most recently, a Toronto newspaper columnist compared Doug and Rob to the North Korean Jong family. That really happened. It wasn\u0027t clear if the columnist was being deliberately hyperbolic or if she was actually hysterical.\u000A\u000AI spent a couple of hours with Doug Ford back in January, in the middle of our polar vortex. It was minus 27 degrees Celsius, and after a month of texts and phone calls, he agreed to meet me for a late-morning coffee at his favorite diner out near the airport. In the parking lot of the Holiday Inn, jumbo jets looked like they were going to land on my car. That seemed about right. Even more surreally perfect, Doug handed me a small gift bag with a dozen mini potatoes and a Ford Nation XL tee shirt inside. The day before our meeting, I\u0027d accidently sent him a text intended for someone else: \u0022Btw, I ate most of those potatoes. Sorry!\u0022 Long story, but DoFo rolled with it.\u000A\u000ADoug is not as hefty as Rob but they share the same oddly reedy voice. In public, neither of them can sell sincerity, which is bizarrely refreshing. Their patter is so canned that it comes off as a gutsy effort to play a cynical game they are too sincere to pull off. It\u0027s an audacious kind of switcheroo, or the real thing, depending on whom you ask. But despite some superficial similarities, within minutes of our sit down, it\u0027s obvious that RoFo and DoFo are not made of interchangeable parts. It\u0027s easier to rattle Doug\u0027s cage. The fat jokes about his brother, the comments about how Rob talks, are hard bait for Doug to resist.\u000A\u000A\u0022I mean this is going to sound crazy and I don\u0027t want you falling off your bench here when I tell you, and I\u0027m being honest: We don\u0027t start fights, we get involved with them,\u0022 he tells me. \u0022When they come after us, we drop the gloves and I go right in there and just hammer the crap out of them. But I don\u0027t go out looking for a fight.\u0022\u000A\u000ADoFo is a nuts and bolts guy who likes to figure out how shit works, especially politics. Rob is shy but somehow connects across a wide base of voters. His fuck ups are heartbreaking because on an especially crappy day, he might even make you picture yourself with your pants down around your ankles in the photocopy room at the office Christmas party. Doug doesn\u0027t give you that feeling. Maybe it\u0027s the 12 years he spent running the family business (a company that makes tags and labels) in Chicago or being the most level-headed of the Ford siblings or the steeliness that comes from shoveling shit at the back of the parade, but DoFo is a different kind of cat. He has the same hard-on for what Rob calls the \u0022liberal elites\u0022 but there\u0027s an edge to his grudge that you don\u0027t hear in his brother—a darker version of the old Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to be part of any club that would have him.\u000A\u000A\u0022In the real world,\u0022 he says, \u0022I\u0027ve seen people come out brilliant, they\u0027re academics, they have their doctorate but their social skills are dreadful. They have no leadership skills, no work ethic. You bring the brightest guy out there and if they can\u0027t work with others and lead the team, they won\u0027t be successful no matter what they do. I don\u0027t care if it\u0027s a doctor, lawyer or whatever.\u0022\u000A\u000ADuring our coffee talk, Doug slipped in and out of his role as Rob\u0027s more articulate, sober-as-a-judge mouthpiece. In-between, I saw glimpses of the same maddening likeability that has driven Toronto liberals bonkers. He loves his kids. He\u0027s protective of his brother. He sees large swaths of Toronto getting the short shrift.\u000A\u000A\u0022Drive through any Tim Horton\u0027s and the people working behind the glass or the counter are making ten, 12 dollars and hour. And you go through and you\u0027re like a hero. They\u0027re cheering you on,\u0027go get \u0027em!\u0027 because those folks, nothing drives them more crazy than bringing home their 300 or 400 dollar paycheck and they see there\u0027s corruption in the government and then the government is asking them for more tas and they can barely put food on the table.\u0022\u000A\u000AOn the way out of the diner, a rough-looking guy with a neck tattoo stops Doug. He\u0027s with three other people who are working their way through heaps of bacon and morning-after home fries. He shakes Doug\u0027s hand and tells him he\u0027s a huge fan and appreciates everything he and his brother have done for his neighborhood. It\u0027s a remarkable exchange when you consider the Ford family business makes $100 million each year and both Rob and Doug forgo their yearly council salary.\u000A\u000AToronto\u0027s frequently apoplectic anti-Ford camp has been trying unsuccessfully to take RoFo out at the knees for four years. They\u0027ve treated Ford Nation like Appalachian cousins, too dumb or too blind from inbreeding to see the truth about the Ford brothers. They did their best to dismantle the notion that the Fords were populists but could never tear that idea down. In part because they never saw the connection RoFo and DoFo have with their constituents is real, despite the weird staginess. On the other side, Ford supporters saw every foible, every hair-raising meltdown, and every undeniably horrific viral video, as a thumb in the eye of the fat-cat liberals who despised them.\u000A\u000ANow, both camps have a new contender in the ring. Doug Ford officially launched his last minute mayoral campaign yesterday. He\u0027s polling at 34 percent, in second place behind leader John Tory, the front-runner.\u000A\u000ADoug Ford is not his brother, but it\u0027s a safe bet that Toronto\u0027s wild and wooly ride is far from over.",

last winter, I had a long hot cup of coffee with Rob Ford&apos;s older brother Doug, who&apos;s now trying to finish the job his charismatic, crack-smoking sibling could not. Who the hell is this crazy DoFo? And could be actually win?</em></p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.3">Until last week, it seemed that no matter how fucked up the story got, and it took some hairy turns, it was impossible that anything could stop Rob Ford. In a twisted version of Greasers vs. Socs, the downtown liberals up here in Toronto were freaking out because our mayor was (still) a fat, glow-in-the-dark white guy from the &apos;burbs while the Ford Nation diehards couldn&apos;t stop gloating that the elites were (still) getting their smarmy asses handed to them. Not only was RoFo still standing, he was gaining on John Tory, the leader in the mayoral race.</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.5">In the end, it wasn&apos;t the crack video that looked like an episode of A&amp;E&apos;s Intervention that put RoFo on the mat. Or the late-night drunken rant at a fast food joint, or the bear tackle of a female councilor at City Hall, or the celebrity style stint in rehab, or even the best comment about cunnilingus since Tony Soprano lamented the unfortunate intersection between psychiatry and eating pussy. After all the larger than life, crazy-ass, catch me if you can shit, it was the cruelly ordinary &quot;abdominal mass&quot; that interrupted the most epic mayoral election in Toronto&apos;s history. Last Thursday, after Ford&apos;s doctors biopsied his tumor, Ford withdrew from the race and for about 20 minutes, Torontonians played nice again. Most people in the city wished him well, including his harshest critics, until the next day when his big brother Doug took his place on the ballot and the city went into spasms of outrage, again.</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.6">Doug Ford has been part of this Daliesque sideshow from the beginning. He ran his brother&apos;s 2010 campaign and took over his city council seat when RoFo upgraded to mayor. He stood by his brother through denials, confessions, failed attempts at sobriety and rehab. DoFo is four years older than Rob with a much quieter life. He married young, 23, and was a father to four girls before he was 30. Since hitching his wagon to Rob, he&apos;s taken more than a few nut punches from the media. He&apos;s been compared to Dick Cheney and the dumb guy in Dumb and Dumber. He has been called Etobicoke&apos;s very own Pablo Escobar for allegedly dealing hash in the 80&apos;s. Some consider him trailer trash pretending to be a Kennedy; others a Kennedy pretending to be trailer trash. Most recently, a Toronto newspaper columnist compared Doug and Rob to the North Korean Jong family. That really happened. It wasn&apos;t clear if the columnist was being deliberately hyperbolic or if she was actually hysterical.</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.7">I spent a couple of hours with Doug Ford back in January, in the middle of our polar vortex. It was minus 27 degrees Celsius, and after a month of texts and phone calls, he agreed to meet me for a late-morning coffee at his favorite diner out near the airport. In the parking lot of the Holiday Inn, jumbo jets looked like they were going to land on my car. That seemed about right. Even more surreally perfect, Doug handed me a small gift bag with a dozen mini potatoes and a Ford Nation XL tee shirt inside. The day before our meeting, I&apos;d accidently sent him a text intended for someone else: &quot;Btw, I ate most of those potatoes. Sorry!&quot; Long story, but DoFo rolled with it.</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.8">Doug is not as hefty as Rob but they share the same oddly reedy voice. In public, neither of them can sell sincerity, which is bizarrely refreshing. Their patter is so canned that it comes off as a gutsy effort to play a cynical game they are too sincere to pull off. It&apos;s an audacious kind of switcheroo, or the real thing, depending on whom you ask. But despite some superficial similarities, within minutes of our sit down, it&apos;s obvious that RoFo and DoFo are not made of interchangeable parts. It&apos;s easier to rattle Doug&apos;s cage. The fat jokes about his brother, the comments about how Rob talks, are hard bait for Doug to resist.</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.9">&quot;I mean this is going to sound crazy and I don&apos;t want you falling off your bench here when I tell you, and I&apos;m being honest: We don&apos;t start fights, we get involved with them,&quot; he tells me. &quot;When they come after us, we drop the gloves and I go right in there and just hammer the crap out of them. But I don&apos;t go out looking for a fight.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.a">DoFo is a nuts and bolts guy who likes to figure out how shit works, especially politics. Rob is shy but somehow connects across a wide base of voters. His fuck ups are heartbreaking because on an especially crappy day, he might even make you picture yourself with your pants down around your ankles in the photocopy room at the office Christmas party. Doug doesn&apos;t give you that feeling. Maybe it&apos;s the 12 years he spent running the family business (a company that makes tags and labels) in Chicago or being the most level-headed of the Ford siblings or the steeliness that comes from shoveling shit at the back of the parade, but DoFo is a different kind of cat. He has the same hard-on for what Rob calls the &quot;liberal elites&quot; but there&apos;s an edge to his grudge that you don&apos;t hear in his brother&#x2014;a darker version of the old Groucho Marx joke about not wanting to be part of any club that would have him.</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.b">&quot;In the real world,&quot; he says, &quot;I&apos;ve seen people come out brilliant, they&apos;re academics, they have their doctorate but their social skills are dreadful. They have no leadership skills, no work ethic. You bring the brightest guy out there and if they can&apos;t work with others and lead the team, they won&apos;t be successful no matter what they do. I don&apos;t care if it&apos;s a doctor, lawyer or whatever.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.c">During our coffee talk, Doug slipped in and out of his role as Rob&apos;s more articulate, sober-as-a-judge mouthpiece. In-between, I saw glimpses of the same maddening likeability that has driven Toronto liberals bonkers. He loves his kids. He&apos;s protective of his brother. He sees large swaths of Toronto getting the short shrift.</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.d">&quot;Drive through any Tim Horton&apos;s and the people working behind the glass or the counter are making ten, 12 dollars and hour. And you go through and you&apos;re like a hero. They&apos;re cheering you on,&apos;go get &apos;em!&apos; because those folks, nothing drives them more crazy than bringing home their 300 or 400 dollar paycheck and they see there&apos;s corruption in the government and then the government is asking them for more tas and they can barely put food on the table.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.e">On the way out of the diner, a rough-looking guy with a neck tattoo stops Doug. He&apos;s with three other people who are working their way through heaps of bacon and morning-after home fries. He shakes Doug&apos;s hand and tells him he&apos;s a huge fan and appreciates everything he and his brother have done for his neighborhood. It&apos;s a remarkable exchange when you consider the Ford family business makes $100 million each year and both Rob and Doug forgo their yearly council salary.</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.f">Toronto&apos;s frequently apoplectic anti-Ford camp has been trying unsuccessfully to take RoFo out at the knees for four years. They&apos;ve treated Ford Nation like Appalachian cousins, too dumb or too blind from inbreeding to see the truth about the Ford brothers. They did their best to dismantle the notion that the Fords were populists but could never tear that idea down. In part because they never saw the connection RoFo and DoFo have with their constituents is real, despite the weird staginess. On the other side, Ford supporters saw every foible, every hair-raising meltdown, and every undeniably horrific viral video, as a thumb in the eye of the fat-cat liberals who despised them.</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.g">Now, both camps have a new contender in the ring. Doug Ford officially launched his last minute mayoral campaign yesterday. He&apos;s polling at 34 percent, in second place behind leader John Tory, the front-runner.</p><p data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.4.h">Doug Ford is not his brother, but it&apos;s a safe bet that Toronto&apos;s wild and wooly ride is far from over.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".11t5qxl9ips.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col
