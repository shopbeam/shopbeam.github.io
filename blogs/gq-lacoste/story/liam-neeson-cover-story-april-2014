  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A He is Lincolnian. The large head with that bor\u0027s nose. The heavy brow. In fact, Steven Spielberg cast Neeson to play the part before it wound up in Daniel Day-Lewis\u0027s hands. But that\u0027s a story for later.\u000A\u000AI meet him at his Manhattan office. Really a pied-&amp;#xE0;-terre. He lives north of the city. A big house near a small town in the country, where he is raising his sons. He\u0027s a single father now, ever since his wife, Natasha Richardson, died after a ski accident in 2009. But he keeps this place for meetings with people like me, or to, as he says, \u0022sit and read and think.\u0022\u000A\u000ANeeson has been acting since he was 11, when he took a part in a school play to impress a girl. That was in Northern Ireland. His first movie role was in 1977, when he played Christ in a movie produced by an American evangelist. The past thirty or so years, you probably know. Solid leading man, everything from The Phantom Menace to Gangs of New York. And of course Schindler\u0027s List. It was an Actor\u0027s Life. Then something strange happened. Neeson did a smallish film called Taken, now a franchise that has earned more than $600 million. At 61, he has become an action star.\u000A\u000AIn person, Neeson speaks with a bit of a brogue. He has small tics, like knocking wood after any hopeful comment. He will interject your name into an answer, like a good bartender. He also carries a supply of toothpicks, a habit since he quit smoking. After offering me wine, he takes a mug of tea and sits down on the couch. He places the toothpick box on the coffee table before us.\u000A\u000A\u0022All right, then,\u0022 he says. \u0022Let\u0027s have at it.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A GQ: How did you come to the decision to do Taken?\u000A\u000A LN: I wanted to do more physical stuff. I really thought it would be kind of a little side road from my so-called career. Really thought it would go straight to video. But it just got great word of mouth. I was stunned.\u000A\u000A And how did you prep for your new film, Non-Stop?\u000A\u000AI train a lot. I don\u0027t try and do all this washboard-abs stuff. That\u0027s not real. I take bits and bobs from everywhere to train. Kettlebells. Power walks. Heavy bag. It\u0027s about stamina.\u000A\u000A Is there anyone you want to work with that you haven\u0027t?\u000A\u000AI\u0027d love to work with Denzel. I have such admiration for him as an actor. I see an incredible nuance of someone who\u0027s so comfortable in front of a camera. There\u0027s an intelligence there; there\u0027s an absolute truth. I\u0027ve never seen that man portray anything less than the truth. It\u0027s pure. I don\u0027t see any little acting signs, any kind of what we would call \u0022chewing the scenery.\u0022 Never, never, never.\u000A\u000A What was it like working with Woody Allen on Husbands and Wives?\u000A\u000AIt was a good experience. Like Mr. Eastwood, he was great, just this... There was a lull; a quiet came over the set when he came on, and he would start: \u0022Okay, I see the camera here. Liam, I think you\u0027re coming down the stairs. I\u0027m going to follow you. You see Judy [Davis], and...\u0022 \u0022Okay.\u0022 \u0022Okay, and let\u0027s do it.\u0022\u000A\u000A Not a lot of takes, right?\u000A\u000AOh no, no, no.\u000A\u000A Because he wants to be done by six o\u0027clock every day.\u000A\u000AOh, we were out at four in the afternoon. It was fucking great. However, there was one incident—people think I\u0027ve made this up, but no. There\u0027s a scene where I\u0027m going down on Judy Davis, right. Judy and I are in bed—obviously covered up—and as I\u0027m going down, Judy\u0027s having this monologue in her head. And the crew are all ready, and we\u0027re waiting for Woody. No-show. It\u0027s starting to get a bit uncomfortable—it\u0027s a bed scene. Anyway, he came out after about twenty minutes and said, \u0022Okay. Camera starts on Judy. Liam, I want to just see the top of your head. Okay, we know where you\u0027re going....\u0022 So there was no apology; nothing. What happened: His lawyer had gotten in touch with him to say Ms. Farrow has found naked photographs of her adopted daughter [Soon-Yi].\u000A\u000A Really?\u000A\u000AYep. That all started on Husbands and Wives. In fact, we did a couple of reshoots with Mia, and then Mia—a few months later, Mia was doing a film with Natasha in Ireland. And Mia, Natasha, and myself became very good friends. She\u0027s lovely. We had a couple of Guinnesses one night, and I told her I was going to marry this woman, and Mia gives this talk about pillars of wisdom: There are certain pillars of wisdom she\u0027d stick to and never veer from. It was quite a beautiful thing about what it is to love someone, respect them, be with them through thick and thin. It was fantastic.\u000A\u000A You\u0027ve done plenty of theater. Did you ever meet Beckett?\u000A\u000ANo, no. I was going to get a tattoo done, because my elder boy wanted a tattoo. I thought I\u0027d do one—like one of those father-son bonding things. Then you have to think, \u0022Well, what the fuck would I get tattooed?\u0022 This quote that my wife has, I wish I had it here. It\u0027s Beckett, and anytime we were onstage [they met on Broadway, when they were in Anna Christie together], we\u0027d put it in our dressing room as inspiration, and it says, \u0022No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.\u0022\u000A\u000A Would that be your motto?\u000A\u000AI think it\u0027s a pretty damn good one. There\u0027s some pessimism there, but there\u0027s also the hope. It\u0027s part of a longer quote. I think it\u0027s: \u0022Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.\u0022\u000A\u000A Who is your best friend?\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s one friend I\u0027ve known since I was 8 or 9. He\u0027s a retired schoolteacher.\u000A\u000A What\u0027s the quality that you respect most in him?\u000A\u000ALoyalty, steadfastness. We talk about everything. We always did. At the age of 8—it\u0027s like, you meet someone and it\u0027s like falling in love. You think, \u0022Wow, this person\u0027s going to be in my life forever.\u0022\u000A\u000A Do you have a treasured memory from those early years of friendship with him?\u000A\u000APlaying Rob Roy MacGregor. Borrowing one of his sister\u0027s skirts. It was plaid, and the pair of us were sword fighting. I don\u0027t know where we got Rob Roy from; I must\u0027ve seen it. It was an early Disney film, I think.\u000A\u000AThere was an old castle that burnt down in our town. But what was left—the gatepost was this sword-shaped piece of metal. Exactly like Excalibur, and I remember us playing Excalibur and discovering this thing: \u0022Fuck! There it is! The sword in the stone!\u0022 And I believed it for years, that just a ten-minute canter from my house was the real sword in the stone. So the childhood was very much idyllic. We were poor, working-class; we didn\u0027t know that. Friends to play with...\u000A\u000A Were you close to your grandparents?\u000A\u000AMy grandfather Jackie was a steam-engine driver. When he retired, he\u0027d always get the newspaper and see who had died. \u0022O\u0027Rafferty? There was an O\u0027Rafferty who was a coal tender for me in 1950.\u0022 And he\u0027d walk out to the funeral and be the only one there. I was 6 or 7 and often was taken to those, walking for fucking miles. Just my grandfather, the priest and the altar boy, and me.\u000A\u000A What did that teach you?\u000A\u000AEverybody matters. Everybody.\u000A\u000A Your mother—what qualities of hers do you have?\u000A\u000ADefinitely stamina, definitely stick at something. She\u0027s 88 now. She was an assistant cook at a girls\u0027 convent school for thirty-four years, and she\u0027s still alive because she walked to work a mile—there and back, all weathers. And coming back, she\u0027d be carrying leftover food that we\u0027d be fed—stuff that would be going to waste, you know? So that\u0027s sort of a lesson: You don\u0027t stick at the job because you loved it; you have to. My father wasn\u0027t bringing enough in. Yeah, they\u0027re a different generation. [pauses] I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen. Our kids now—every generation worries about their kids.\u000A\u000A How old are your boys now?\u000A\u000ASeventeen and 18.\u000A\u000A What are you most proud of, as a father, that you\u0027ve taught them?\u000A\u000AI think they do know that I\u0027ll always be there, no matter what happens. But the thing Tasha and I really wanted to instill in them was manners. That may sound like such a basic thing, but I\u0027ve heard so many adults say, \u0022Oh, my God, your sons—they look you straight in the eye. They\u0027re very polite and mannered.\u0022 It makes me proud. And it can get you through a lot, in a way. Just showing respect for your fellow man.\u000A\u000A What\u0027s the hardest part about being a single father?\u000A\u000AUm, I can\u0027t answer that. It\u0027s just still a day-to-day thing, you know? My boys are teenagers. They\u0027re experimenting. They\u0027re flexing muscles and sometimes dangerous avenues, and you think, \u0022Fuck. If Tasha was here, someone could share this.\u0022 But yeah, we\u0027re doing all right, you know?\u000A\u000AYou just—there\u0027s a worry nowadays, with every parent I\u0027ve spoken to. It\u0027s fucking drugs. It\u0027s a virus. A teenager can take it and suddenly they can be hooked, and it changes their life and their family\u0027s forever. That\u0027s my constant worry. And I trust them, and they\u0027re sensible boys, but it can be just that chemistry that doesn\u0027t work.\u000A\u000AAnd now there\u0027s talk of legalizing it.... It\u0027s like, fuck.... I was never into drugs, but I had a bad motorbike accident in 2000 and broke my pelvis, my heel. I wasn\u0027t supposed to last the night. And when they took me to the hospital and gave me morphine, ugh, I thought, \u0022This is how I want to go, with a big fuckin\u0027 jar of this stuff.\u0022 And then when they give you that drip that you give yourself every six minutes...I knew I was hooked, because I was counting those fucking drips, the seconds until I could push that button, and it was instantaneous, that high was.\u000A\u000A  [He gestures at my wineglass.] \u000A\u000AAre you happy with that, Michael?\u000A\u000A I\u0027m very happy.\u000A\u000AI\u0027m glad you like that wine. It\u0027s a very light Pinot Noir. But I gave up drinking about a year ago.\u000A\u000A What made you decide to do that?\u000A\u000AWell, I was just—I was drinking too much. It started since my wife died. It was like, so easy to just... Never at work, never would do it like that, but this time of night? Sitting with you, I\u0027d easily have—I\u0027d be on my second bottle. Before we finished, I would have been halfway down a third—and be totally fine! Pinot Noir: That\u0027s all I drink. I was never into spirits or liquor, hard liquor. And I gave up the Guinness years ago, because it just—past an age, it sticks to you, you know? So last year, I just thought—they\u0027ve been throwing these action movies at me, and I thought, \u0022Okay, let\u0027s just change it a little bit.\u0022 And it\u0027s been great. I love it. [knocks on wood]\u000A\u000A Will you date again? Are you dating?\u000A\u000AI\u0027m keeping myself to myself. And I like it that way. I\u0027m not hunting. I\u0027m the opposite of a—what would a male cougar be? Is there such a thing? Whatever it is, I\u0027m not that.\u000A\u000A You were raised Catholic, were an altar boy—what residue has that left in you?\u000A\u000AUm, there was the classic sort of sense of theater, the celebration of the Mass and the Benediction: lighting the candles, putting on the costume. One of my jobs was to light the charcoal in the thurible.\u000A\u000A I love that you know the name of that.\u000A\u000AYeah, and the monstrance, where the Host is kept. In those days, we were saying Mass in Latin, which I had learned phonetically from a priest who was training us for the altar. It was beautiful. Mea culpa, mea culpa: my fault, my fault, my most grievous fault. Beautiful language, you know? But yeah, the ceremony of it all was fantastic. Every so often, little droplets of the power of this ceremony would filter down through to you.\u000A\u000AAnd then we\u0027d have these missionaries who would arrive from Gabon and fuckin\u0027 Congo, and they were weird guys. They\u0027d have rosary beads wrapped around their waist with a huge cross. I remember going to confession once, and I had to learn the word masturbation in order to confess it. I wound up confessing it to one of these missionaries, and he fucking just lit into me. \u0022YOU DID WHAT? YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS EVIL PRACTICE.\u0022 Then I remember opening the door, and I could see all these old ladies waiting, and... Fuck\u0027s sake.\u000A\u000A I was raised Catholic, too. Do you ever find that when you tell someone, their response is like, \u0022So, what happened?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022What\u0027s your story?\u0022\u000A\u000A I say, \u0022I\u0027m sorry to disappoint you, but I had the best priests in the world.\u0022\u000A\u000AMe, too. And they won\u0027t believe it: \u0022Oh, come on. They must have fiddled your willy.\u0022 No, there were a lot of good men—and women, too. We had one nun, Sister Attracta—I think Mary Caulfield was her name before marriage to Christ. Oh, she was a terror—but she taught me the Irish language for this play that we were doing. Years later, I was doing a play in Dublin, and I get a knock on my dressing-room door, and it was Sister Attracta. She was just beaming with delight. I\u0027ve never forgot it.\u000A\u000A That first movie you made, Pilgrim\u0027s Progress, where you played Jesus—tell me how that came to be.\u000A\u000AI was in a theater in Belfast; this evangelical-outreach organization came. They were holding auditions for the local actors to make a film. They saw all the local actors, saw me, and I was the evangelist who\u0027s the Christ figure. We shot it in Cavehill, which is just overlooking Belfast. I don\u0027t know what I got paid. Peanuts, but it was a lot, it seemed. There was quite a bit of praying going on, too, which is very lovely, but I couldn\u0027t wait to get back to the theater and go into the pub. There were some born-again, my first experience with them. Lovely people. Yeah, that was my first experience in front of a camera.\u000A\u000A What do you remember about it?\u000A\u000AJust how time-consuming it was, you know? You\u0027re ready to do your thing, and then, \u0022You have to wait ten minutes. That cloud has to pass.\u0022 Henry Fonda\u0027s definition of screen acting is learning how to wait. Absolutely right.\u000A\u000A Most people don\u0027t know that you\u0027d been originally cast to play Lincoln. Was it hard to let go of that?\u000A\u000ANo. I had a real thunderbolt moment with that. Steven had approached me to play it—fuck, it must be ten years ago. Sent me a script, and I was like, \u0022God.\u0022 And he told me roughly when he might want to shoot it, so I started researching. I maybe did four years\u0027 worth of research. Anyway, so then Doris Kearns Goodwin\u0027s book came out, [Team of] Rivals. Then we get a new screenwriter—ugh, his name just slipped.\u000A\u000A Kushner?\u000A\u000ATony. Tony was on board, and I was sent the script. I had—it was different to what had been before. Before it had been, I thought, a wonderful kind of old-fashioned biography of Lincoln, you know, from his inauguration to his death. And Tony\u0027s was very—it was that period between passing the Proclamation and... Anyway, Natasha died in March, and then—I want to think it was toward the end of April, Steven got together a reading, and we all sat: Sally Field, John Lithgow. Oh, just great actors. And Doris Kearns Goodwin, and Steven, of course. We started reading this, and there was an intro, and then I see \u0022Lincoln:\u0022 where I have to start speaking, and I just—a thunderbolt moment. I thought, \u0022I\u0027m not supposed to be here. This is gone. I\u0027ve passed my sell-by date. I don\u0027t want to play this Lincoln. I can\u0027t be him.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo the next two and a half, three hours of reading through it... This extraordinary piece of writing, but it had no connection with me whatsoever. It was a very strange feeling, and it was partly grief. I read very, very poorly by any standards, but then some people come up afterward and say, \u0022Oh, you\u0027re made to play Lincoln.\u0022 I just was cringing with embarrassment. Afterward, Steven came over, and I said, \u0022Steven, you have to recast this now.\u0022 And he said, \u0022What are you talking about?\u0022 And I said, \u0022I\u0027m serious. You have to recast it.\u0022 So I went back home, and that night I called Doris, and I had a wee chat with her. And then I called Steven, and I said, \u0022Steven, this is not for me. I can\u0027t explain it. It\u0027s gone. It\u0027s not...\u0022 And he got it. He said, \u0022Okay.\u0022 And that was it.\u000A\u000ADaniel is—Daniel Day\u0027s an old pal, and I think Daniel maybe had been approached first; I don\u0027t know the history of that, but I was thrilled that Daniel played him, and when I saw the film, I was like, \u0022He\u0027s fuckin\u0027 Abraham Lincoln. This is perfect.\u0022 Perfect.\u000A\u000AHowever, it\u0027s inspired me: I\u0027d still like to do Lincoln\u0027s story. As much as I admired the film, there\u0027s all of America and all of the rest of the world who haven\u0027t a fucking clue who Lincoln is, who he was. I think the film shows him, yes, but I think I\u0027d still like to do an old-fashioned biography of Lincoln.\u000A\u000A Did your grief cloud you in that moment? I mean, as you mentioned...\u000A\u000ASure, it certainly—it was in there somewhere.\u000A\u000A Do you have a favorite parable from the Bible?\u000A\u000AWhat my wife has on her tombstone, I guess that\u0027s my favorite now: \u0022Cast your bread upon the water, and it will be returned tenfold.\u0022 That\u0027s not the direct quote, but that\u0027s what I put on her gravestone. She was always saying that to me, you know? Where I\u0027d be going, \u0022Eh, I\u0027m not sure.\u0022 She\u0027d say the opposite. I would always say the glass is half empty, and she would always say half full. Always. But I\u0027m changing, I think.\u000A\u000A Do you still have faith?\u000A\u000AI think I do. I mean, I don\u0027t practice. But it\u0027s not far from me. And I have faith in the power of theater, which is quite similar—a body of people seeing something being enacted. It\u0027s at least 4,000 years old; I see how that can move people and change attitudes, the power. I believe in that faith. Since my wife passed away, do I believe in an afterlife? I don\u0027t know.\u000A\u000A What\u0027s your epitaph?\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t know. Tasha, she\u0027s buried up near our house. Old cemetery. Her grandmother, too. I go see Tasha once or twice a week. Just to talk. I like it.... There\u0027s a Civil War soldier near her. I look at his headstone a lot. All it says is GRIT AND GRACE.\u000A\u000A MICHAEL HAINEY (@michaelhainey) is GQ\u0027s deputy editor and the author of the memoir After Visiting Friends: A Son\u0027s Story.",

The large head with that bor&#x2019;s nose. The heavy brow. In fact, Steven Spielberg cast Neeson to play the part before it wound up in Daniel Day-Lewis&#x2019;s hands. But that&#x2019;s a story for later.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.2">I meet him at his Manhattan office. Really a pied-&amp;#xE0;-terre. He lives north of the city. A big house near a small town in the country, where he is raising his sons. He&#x2019;s a single father now, ever since his wife, Natasha Richardson, died after a ski accident in 2009. But he keeps this place for meetings with people like me, or to, as he says, &quot;sit and read and think.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.3">Neeson has been acting since he was 11, when he took a part in a school play to impress a girl. That was in Northern Ireland. His first movie role was in 1977, when he played Christ in a movie produced by an American evangelist. The past thirty or so years, you probably know. Solid leading man, everything from <em>The Phantom Menace</em> to <em>Gangs of New York.</em> And of course <em>Schindler&#x2019;s List.</em> It was an Actor&#x2019;s Life. Then something strange happened. Neeson did a smallish film called <em>Taken,</em> now a franchise that has earned more than $600 million. At 61, he has become an action star.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.5">In person, Neeson speaks with a bit of a brogue. He has small tics, like knocking wood after any hopeful comment. He will interject your name into an answer, like a good bartender. He also carries a supply of toothpicks, a habit since he quit smoking. After offering me wine, he takes a mug of tea and sits down on the couch. He places the toothpick box on the coffee table before us.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.6">&quot;All right, then,&quot; he says. &quot;Let&#x2019;s have at it.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.7"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.8"> <strong>GQ: How did you come to the decision to do <em>Taken</em>?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.9"> <strong>LN:</strong> I wanted to do more physical stuff. I really thought it would be kind of a little side road from my so-called career. Really thought it would go straight to video. But it just got great word of mouth. I was stunned.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.a"> <strong>And how did you prep for your new film, <em>Non-Stop</em>?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.b">I train a lot. I don&#x2019;t try and do all this washboard-abs stuff. That&#x2019;s not real. I take bits and bobs from everywhere to train. Kettlebells. Power walks. Heavy bag. It&#x2019;s about stamina.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.c"> <strong>Is there anyone you want to work with that you haven&#x2019;t?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.d">I&#x2019;d love to work with Denzel. I have such admiration for him as an actor. I see an incredible nuance of someone who&#x2019;s so comfortable in front of a camera. There&#x2019;s an intelligence there; there&#x2019;s an absolute truth. I&#x2019;ve never seen that man portray anything less than the truth. It&#x2019;s pure. I don&#x2019;t see any little acting signs, any kind of what we would call &quot;chewing the scenery.&quot; Never, never, never.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.e"> <strong>What was it like working with Woody Allen on <em>Husbands and Wives</em>?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.f">It was a good experience. Like Mr. Eastwood, he was great, just this... There was a lull; a quiet came over the set when he came on, and he would start: &quot;Okay, I see the camera here. Liam, I think you&#x2019;re coming down the stairs. I&#x2019;m going to follow you. You see Judy [Davis], and...&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;Okay, and let&#x2019;s do it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.g"> <strong>Not a lot of takes, right?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.h">Oh no, no, no.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.i"> <strong>Because he wants to be done by six o&#x2019;clock every day.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.j">Oh, we were out at four in the afternoon. It was fucking great. However, there was one incident&#x2014;people think I&#x2019;ve made this up, but no. There&#x2019;s a scene where I&#x2019;m going down on Judy Davis, right. Judy and I are in bed&#x2014;obviously covered up&#x2014;and as I&#x2019;m going down, Judy&#x2019;s having this monologue in her head. And the crew are all ready, and we&#x2019;re waiting for Woody. No-show. It&#x2019;s starting to get a bit uncomfortable&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a bed scene. Anyway, he came out after about twenty minutes and said, &quot;Okay. Camera starts on Judy. Liam, I want to just see the top of your head. Okay, we know where you&#x2019;re going....&quot; So there was no apology; nothing. What happened: His lawyer had gotten in touch with him to say Ms. Farrow has found naked photographs of her adopted daughter [Soon-Yi].</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.k"> <strong>Really?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.l">Yep. That all started on <em>Husbands and Wives.</em> In fact, we did a couple of reshoots with Mia, and then Mia&#x2014;a few months later, Mia was doing a film with Natasha in Ireland. And Mia, Natasha, and myself became very good friends. She&#x2019;s lovely. We had a couple of Guinnesses one night, and I told her I was going to marry this woman, and Mia gives this talk about pillars of wisdom: There are certain pillars of wisdom she&#x2019;d stick to and never veer from. It was quite a beautiful thing about what it is to love someone, respect them, be with them through thick and thin. It was fantastic.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.m"> <strong>You&#x2019;ve done plenty of theater. Did you ever meet Beckett?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.n">No, no. I was going to get a tattoo done, because my elder boy wanted a tattoo. I thought I&#x2019;d do one&#x2014;like one of those father-son bonding things. Then you have to think, &quot;Well, what the fuck would I get tattooed?&quot; This quote that my wife has, I wish I had it here. It&#x2019;s Beckett, and anytime we were onstage [they met on Broadway, when they were in <em>Anna Christie</em> together], we&#x2019;d put it in our dressing room as inspiration, and it says, &quot;No matter.

Borrowing one of his sister&#x2019;s skirts. It was plaid, and the pair of us were sword fighting. I don&#x2019;t know where we got Rob Roy from; I must&#x2019;ve seen it. It was an early Disney film, I think.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.w">There was an old castle that burnt down in our town. But what was left&#x2014;the gatepost was this sword-shaped piece of metal. Exactly like Excalibur, and I remember us playing Excalibur and discovering this thing: &quot;Fuck! There it is! The sword in the stone!&quot; And I believed it for years, that just a ten-minute canter from my house was the real sword in the stone. So the childhood was very much idyllic. We were poor, working-class; we didn&#x2019;t know that.

When he retired, he&#x2019;d always get the newspaper and see who had died. &quot;O&#x2019;Rafferty? There was an O&#x2019;Rafferty who was a coal tender for me in 1950.&quot; And he&#x2019;d walk out to the funeral and be the only one there. I was 6 or 7 and often was taken to those, walking for fucking miles.

She was an assistant cook at a girls&#x2019; convent school for thirty-four years, and she&#x2019;s still alive because she walked to work a mile&#x2014;there and back, all weathers. And coming back, she&#x2019;d be carrying leftover food that we&#x2019;d be fed&#x2014;stuff that would be going to waste, you know? So that&#x2019;s sort of a lesson: You don&#x2019;t stick at the job because you loved it; you <em>have</em> to. My father wasn&#x2019;t bringing enough in. Yeah, they&#x2019;re a different generation. <em>[pauses]</em> I don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s going to happen.

But the thing Tasha and I really wanted to instill in them was manners. That may sound like such a basic thing, but I&#x2019;ve heard so many adults say, &quot;Oh, my God, your sons&#x2014;they look you straight in the eye. They&#x2019;re very polite and mannered.&quot; It makes me proud. And it can get you through a lot, in a way.

It&#x2019;s just still a day-to-day thing, you know? My boys are teenagers. They&#x2019;re experimenting. They&#x2019;re flexing muscles and sometimes dangerous avenues, and you think, &quot;Fuck. If Tasha was here, someone could share this.&quot; But yeah, we&#x2019;re doing all right, you know?</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.19">You just&#x2014;there&#x2019;s a worry nowadays, with every parent I&#x2019;ve spoken to. It&#x2019;s fucking drugs. It&#x2019;s a virus. A teenager can take it and suddenly they can be hooked, and it changes their life and their family&#x2019;s forever. That&#x2019;s my constant worry. And I trust them, and they&#x2019;re sensible boys, but it can be just that chemistry that doesn&#x2019;t work.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1a">And now there&#x2019;s talk of legalizing it.... It&#x2019;s like, fuck.... I was never into drugs, but I had a bad motorbike accident in 2000 and broke my pelvis, my heel. I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to last the night. And when they took me to the hospital and gave me morphine, ugh, I thought, &quot;This is how I want to go, with a big fuckin&#x2019; jar of this stuff.&quot; And then when they give you that drip that you give yourself every six minutes...I knew I was hooked, because I was counting those fucking drips, the seconds until I could push that button, and it was instantaneous, that high was.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1b"> <strong> <em>[He gestures at my wineglass.]</em> </strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1c">Are you happy with that, Michael?</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> <strong>I&#x2019;m very happy.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1e">I&#x2019;m glad you like that wine.

It started since my wife died. It was like, so easy to just... Never at work, never would do it like that, but this time of night? Sitting with you, I&#x2019;d easily have&#x2014;I&#x2019;d be on my second bottle. Before we finished, I would have been halfway down a third&#x2014;and be totally fine! Pinot Noir: That&#x2019;s all I drink. I was never into spirits or liquor, hard liquor. And I gave up the Guinness years ago, because it just&#x2014;past an age, it sticks to you, you know? So last year, I just thought&#x2014;they&#x2019;ve been throwing these action movies at me, and I thought, &quot;Okay, let&#x2019;s just change it a little bit.&quot; And it&#x2019;s been great.

One of my jobs was to light the charcoal in the thurible.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1l"> <strong>I love that you know the name of that.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1m">Yeah, and the monstrance, where the Host is kept. In those days, we were saying Mass in Latin, which I had learned phonetically from a priest who was training us for the altar. It was beautiful. <em>Mea culpa, mea culpa:</em> my fault, my fault, my most grievous fault. Beautiful language, you know? But yeah, the ceremony of it all was fantastic. Every so often, little droplets of the power of this ceremony would filter down through to you.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1n">And then we&#x2019;d have these missionaries who would arrive from Gabon and fuckin&#x2019; Congo, and they were weird guys. They&#x2019;d have rosary beads wrapped around their waist with a huge cross. I remember going to confession once, and I had to learn the word <em>masturbation</em> in order to confess it. I wound up confessing it to one of these missionaries, and he fucking just lit into me. &quot;YOU DID WHAT? YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS EVIL PRACTICE.&quot; Then I remember opening the door, and I could see all these old ladies waiting, and... Fuck&#x2019;s sake.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1o"> <strong>I was raised Catholic, too.

And they won&#x2019;t believe it: &quot;Oh, come on. They must have fiddled your willy.&quot; No, there were a lot of good men&#x2014;and women, too. We had one nun, Sister Attracta&#x2014;I think Mary Caulfield was her name before marriage to Christ. Oh, she was a terror&#x2014;but she taught me the Irish language for this play that we were doing. Years later, I was doing a play in Dublin, and I get a knock on my dressing-room door, and it was Sister Attracta. She was just beaming with delight. I&#x2019;ve never forgot it.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1s"> <strong>That first movie you made, <em>Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress,</em> where you played Jesus&#x2014;tell me how that came to be.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1t">I was in a theater in Belfast; this evangelical-outreach organization came. They were holding auditions for the local actors to make a film. They saw all the local actors, saw me, and I was the evangelist who&#x2019;s the Christ figure. We shot it in Cavehill, which is just overlooking Belfast. I don&#x2019;t know what I got paid. Peanuts, but it was a lot, it seemed. There was quite a bit of praying going on, too, which is very lovely, but I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get back to the theater and go into the pub. There were some born-again, my first experience with them. Lovely people. Yeah, that was my first experience in front of a camera.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1u"> <strong>What do you remember about it?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1v">Just how time-consuming it was, you know? You&#x2019;re ready to do your thing, and then, &quot;You have to wait ten minutes. That cloud has to pass.&quot; Henry Fonda&#x2019;s definition of screen acting is learning how to wait. Absolutely right.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1w"> <strong>Most people don&#x2019;t know that you&#x2019;d been originally cast to play Lincoln. Was it hard to let go of that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1x">No. I had a real thunderbolt moment with that. Steven had approached me to play it&#x2014;fuck, it must be ten years ago. Sent me a script, and I was like, &quot;God.&quot; And he told me roughly when he might want to shoot it, so I started researching. I maybe did four years&#x2019; worth of research. Anyway, so then Doris Kearns Goodwin&#x2019;s book came out, <em>[Team of] Rivals.</em> Then we get a new screenwriter&#x2014;ugh, his name just slipped.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1y"> <strong>Kushner?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.1z">Tony. Tony was on board, and I was sent the script. I had&#x2014;it was different to what had been before. Before it had been, I thought, a wonderful kind of old-fashioned biography of Lincoln, you know, from his inauguration to his death. And Tony&#x2019;s was very&#x2014;it was that period between passing the Proclamation and... Anyway, Natasha died in March, and then&#x2014;I want to think it was toward the end of April, Steven got together a reading, and we all sat: Sally Field, John Lithgow. Oh, just great actors. And Doris Kearns Goodwin, and Steven, of course. We started reading this, and there was an intro, and then I see &quot;Lincoln:&quot; where I have to start speaking, and I just&#x2014;a thunderbolt moment. I thought, &quot;I&#x2019;m not supposed to be here. This is gone. I&#x2019;ve passed my sell-by date. I don&#x2019;t want to play this Lincoln. I can&#x2019;t be him.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.20">So the next two and a half, three hours of reading through it... This extraordinary piece of writing, but it had no connection with me whatsoever. It was a very strange feeling, and it was partly grief. I read very, very poorly by any standards, but then some people come up afterward and say, &quot;Oh, you&#x2019;re made to play Lincoln.&quot; I just was cringing with embarrassment. Afterward, Steven came over, and I said, &quot;Steven, you have to recast this now.&quot; And he said, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; And I said, &quot;I&#x2019;m serious. You have to recast it.&quot; So I went back home, and that night I called Doris, and I had a wee chat with her. And then I called Steven, and I said, &quot;Steven, this is not for me. I can&#x2019;t explain it. It&#x2019;s gone. It&#x2019;s not...&quot; And he got it. He said, &quot;Okay.&quot; And that was it.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.21">Daniel is&#x2014;Daniel Day&#x2019;s an old pal, and I think Daniel maybe had been approached first; I don&#x2019;t know the history of that, but I was thrilled that Daniel played him, and when I saw the film, I was like, &quot;He&#x2019;s fuckin&#x2019; Abraham Lincoln. This is perfect.&quot; Perfect.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.22">However, it&#x2019;s inspired me: I&#x2019;d still like to do Lincoln&#x2019;s story. As much as I admired the film, there&#x2019;s all of America and all of the rest of the world who haven&#x2019;t a fucking clue who Lincoln is, who he was. I think the film shows him, yes, but I think I&#x2019;d still like to do an old-fashioned biography of Lincoln.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.23"> <strong>Did your grief cloud you in that moment? I mean, as you mentioned...</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.24">Sure, it certainly&#x2014;it was in there somewhere.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.25"> <strong>Do you have a favorite parable from the Bible?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.26">What my wife has on her tombstone, I guess that&#x2019;s my favorite now: &quot;Cast your bread upon the water, and it will be returned tenfold.&quot; That&#x2019;s not the direct quote, but that&#x2019;s what I put on her gravestone. She was always saying that to me, you know? Where I&#x2019;d be going, &quot;Eh, I&#x2019;m not sure.&quot; She&#x2019;d say the opposite. I would always say the glass is half empty, and she would always say half full. Always. But I&#x2019;m changing, I think.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.27"> <strong>Do you still have faith?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.28">I think I do. I mean, I don&#x2019;t practice. But it&#x2019;s not far from me. And I have faith in the power of theater, which is quite similar&#x2014;a body of people seeing something being enacted. It&#x2019;s at least 4,000 years old; I see how that can move people and change attitudes, the power. I believe in that faith. Since my wife passed away, do I believe in an afterlife? I don&#x2019;t know.</p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.29"> <strong>What&#x2019;s your epitaph?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".16vmdf8l4w.1.1.0.0.4.2a">I don&#x2019;t know. Tasha, she&#x2019;s buried up near our house. Old cemetery. Her grandmother, too. I go see Tasha once or twice a week. Just to talk. I like it.... There&#x2019;s a Civil War soldier near her.
