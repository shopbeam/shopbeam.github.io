  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AJanuary is never kind to the NBA. It\u0027s a dead spot, a temporary respite, the empty shuffling before the storm. The initial buzz of the new season has worn off; the All-Star break and the onset of real basketball is just over the horizon. In between there\u0027s … nothing. (And lots of NFL playoff action.) Even die-hards such as yours truly have been known to take a little breather.\u000A\u000AThis season, though, things are different. Instead of the mid-winter doldrums, your National Basketball Association is alive and poppin\u0027. The Hawks, the surprise team of the year (the decade?) are sitting atop the East and riding a 14-game win streak. The post-Josh Smith Pistons have come to life, thanks to a combination of Stan Van Gundy\u0027s coaching and raw talents like Brandon Jennings, Andre Drummond, and Greg Monroe achieving some measure of consistency. The Warriors, Blazers, and Wizards continue to play well, suggesting that we\u0027re witnessing a changing of the elite guard—not just an off-year fluke.\u000A\u000ABut the NBA still revolves around its biggest names, and while the likes of Steph Curry and Damian Lillard have emerged as full-fledged superstars, they\u0027re still a long way from two guys you may have heard of: LeBron James and Kevin Durant. These two remain the NBA\u0027s top players—at this point, the exact order seems irrelevant—and yet both have somehow flown under the radar this season. That is, until now.\u000A\u000AHeading into 2014-15, James and Durant were expected to once again dominate the NBA. The two would continue their battle for world supremacy. KD would continue to up his game while LeBron would keep being LeBron James. The debate over which one was the best in the league would rage on; Durant would have to defend his MVP and LeBron would seek to reclaim an award that has, more or less, belonged to him for the last five years.\u000A\u000AMost importantly, though, both had clear-cut narratives behind them. LeBron had come home to Cleveland and assembled a roster expected to immediately contend. It was a new beginning that rinsed away the noxious stain of the Heat years. Durant, on the other hand, would yet again try to get the Thunder over the hump and win his first title—and spend all year deflecting questions about his upcoming free agency.\u000A\u000AThings haven\u0027t quite worked out as expected. The Cavs have been all over the place. LeBron hasn\u0027t been himself. He\u0027s been injured. His team can\u0027t play defense. Rookie coach David Blatt might be in over his head. The Thunder lost Durant before the season even started and then lost Russell Westbrook soon after that. They\u0027re both back now and firing on most, if not all, cylinders—but there\u0027s still a very real chance that Oklahoma City won\u0027t make the playoffs in the ultra-competitive West. By any measure, it\u0027s been a disappointing year so far for James and Durant.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AUsually, when players of this caliber don\u0027t have their teams in immediate contention, they catch flack for it. Except that\u0027s not happening with these two. With Durant, it\u0027s understandable. His team is more a victim of circumstance and bad luck than anything he (or Westbrook, who is having a career year) have done wrong. In LeBron\u0027s case, something\u0027s just not quite right with the King or his new team.  Given that he returned to Cleveland as a man on a mission, the current state of the Cavs would seem to be a direct indictment of James. Instead, like KD, James has emerged as unlikely underdog—a nearly ridiculous sentence to write about the two best player of their generation.\u000A\u000AMore so than even the Hawks or the Warriors, the Thunder—a juggernaut that usually rolls through the first 82 games—have emerged as the feel-good story of the NBA season. It helps that Durant is impossibly likeable and Westbrook, when he\u0027s playing well, is the most dynamic player in the game. Still, as the team fights for a chance to prove itself in the postseason, it\u0027s hard not to pull for them. They were expected to get yet another fair shot at a title, to prove they weren\u0027t just regular season phenoms. But the injures to KD and Westbrook put them at the bottom of the stands and now they\u0027re playing from behind, trying to dig themselves out of that hole. Instead of scrutinizing the Thunder, we\u0027re just hoping they get a chance to be themselves in April.\u000A\u000ALeBron is a far more interesting case. With him poised to redeem the entire recent sports history of Ohio, there were good vibes around the Cavs as soon as he made his announcement. It possibly hurt his cause that Cleveland morphed into another ad hoc super-team but such is the new reality of the NBA. Talent attracts more talent, and the naysayers are powerless to prevent it.\u000A\u000AThe Cavaliers\u0027 struggles and LeBron\u0027s own up and down year have gotten in the way of these prophetic aspirations. But James\u0027s homecoming has made him into a far more sympathetic figure. And unlike the Heat, who practically begged us to hate them, this is a Cavs team many of us want to like. At first blush, the Heat were a mercenary killing machine gone horribly awry; the Cavs, on the other hand, could be a lot of fun if they ever got it together. That\u0027s where James finds himself now: Trying to rally himself and his fans not for reputation\u0027s sake, but to do right by everyone who invested so much in his 2014-15. He\u0027s not worrying about his legacy or his own past performance. LeBron James is just out to make everyone happy. And for once, it comes across as genuine.\u000A\u000AWho knows how long this warm and fuzzy feeling will last. At some point, the Thunder will probably go white-hot, soar into the postseason, and scare the living shit out of whomever has to face them in the first round. This will happen and we\u0027ll forget all about OKC\u0027s adversity. The Cavs will eventually exhaust our patience and quite possibly take a mulligan on this season. At some point, \u0022what\u0027s going on with LeBron?\u0022 could morph into \u0022what\u0027s wrong with LeBron?\u0022 Lucky for them, they\u0027ll always be in the mix in the woeful East—a security blanket of sorts, but hardly reassurance.\u000A\u000AUnfortunately, only one of these two players can end up with the title we expected them to compete for. For now, though, it\u0027s exciting to watch them both have to fight and claw like mere mortals.",

kind to the NBA. It&apos;s a dead spot, a temporary respite, the empty shuffling before the storm. The initial buzz of the new season has worn off; the All-Star break and the onset of real basketball is just over the horizon. In between there&apos;s &#x2026; nothing. (And lots of NFL playoff action.) Even die-hards such as yours truly have been known to take a little breather.</p><p data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.2">This season, though, things are different. Instead of the mid-winter doldrums, your National Basketball Association is alive and poppin&apos;. The Hawks, the surprise team of the year (the decade?) are sitting atop the East and riding a 14-game win streak. The post-Josh Smith Pistons have come to life, thanks to a combination of Stan Van Gundy&apos;s coaching and raw talents like Brandon Jennings, Andre Drummond, and Greg Monroe achieving some measure of consistency. The Warriors, Blazers, and Wizards continue to play well, suggesting that we&apos;re witnessing a changing of the elite guard&#x2014;not just an off-year fluke.</p><p data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.3">But the NBA still revolves around its biggest names, and while the likes of Steph Curry and Damian Lillard have emerged as full-fledged superstars, they&apos;re still a long way from two guys you may have heard of: LeBron James and Kevin Durant. These two remain the NBA&apos;s top players&#x2014;at this point, the exact order seems irrelevant&#x2014;and yet both have somehow flown under the radar this season. That is, until now.</p><p data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.5">Heading into 2014-15, James and Durant were expected to once again dominate the NBA. The two would continue their battle for world supremacy. KD would continue to up his game while LeBron would keep being LeBron James. The debate over which one was the best in the league would rage on; Durant would have to defend his MVP and LeBron would seek to reclaim an award that has, more or less, belonged to him for the last five years.</p><p data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.6">Most importantly, though, both had clear-cut narratives behind them. LeBron had come home to Cleveland and assembled a roster expected to immediately contend. It was a new beginning that rinsed away the noxious stain of the Heat years. Durant, on the other hand, would yet again try to get the Thunder over the hump and win his first title&#x2014;and spend all year deflecting questions about his upcoming free agency.</p><p data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.7">Things haven&apos;t quite worked out as expected. The Cavs have been all over the place. LeBron hasn&apos;t been himself. He&apos;s been injured. His team can&apos;t play defense. Rookie coach David Blatt might be in over his head. The Thunder lost Durant before the season even started and then lost Russell Westbrook soon after that. They&apos;re both back now and firing on most, if not all, cylinders&#x2014;but there&apos;s still a very real chance that Oklahoma City won&apos;t make the playoffs in the ultra-competitive West. By any measure, it&apos;s been a disappointing year so far for James and Durant.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.8"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55828dd1e52bc4b477a98730/master/w_768/blogs-the-feed-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nba-season-2015-02.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nba-season-2015-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flebron-james-kevin-durant-2015s-most-exciting-underdogs&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nba-season-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flebron-james-kevin-durant-2015s-most-exciting-underdogs&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nba-season-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flebron-james-kevin-durant-2015s-most-exciting-underdogs&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828dd1e52bc4b477a98730%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nba-season-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nba-season-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flebron-james-kevin-durant-2015s-most-exciting-underdogs&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828dd1e52bc4b477a98730%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nba-season-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-lebron-james-kevin-durant-nba-season-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.9">Usually, when players of this caliber don&apos;t have their teams in immediate contention, they catch flack for it. Except that&apos;s not happening with these two. With Durant, it&apos;s understandable. His team is more a victim of circumstance and bad luck than anything he (or Westbrook, who is having a career year) have done wrong. In LeBron&apos;s case, something&apos;s just not quite right with the King or his new team.  Given that he returned to Cleveland as a man on a mission, the current state of the Cavs would seem to be a direct indictment of James. Instead, like KD, James has emerged as unlikely underdog&#x2014;a nearly ridiculous sentence to write about the two best player of their generation.</p><p data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.a">More so than even the Hawks or the Warriors, the Thunder&#x2014;a juggernaut that usually rolls through the first 82 games&#x2014;have emerged as the feel-good story of the NBA season. It helps that Durant is impossibly likeable and Westbrook, when he&apos;s playing well, is the most dynamic player in the game. Still, as the team fights for a chance to prove itself in the postseason, it&apos;s hard not to pull for them. They were expected to get yet another fair shot at a title, to prove they weren&apos;t just regular season phenoms. But the injures to KD and Westbrook put them at the bottom of the stands and now they&apos;re playing from behind, trying to dig themselves out of that hole. Instead of scrutinizing the Thunder, we&apos;re just hoping they get a chance to be themselves in April.</p><p data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.b">LeBron is a far more interesting case. With him poised to redeem the entire recent sports history of Ohio, there were good vibes around the Cavs as soon as he made his announcement. It possibly hurt his cause that Cleveland morphed into another ad hoc super-team but such is the new reality of the NBA. Talent attracts more talent, and the naysayers are powerless to prevent it.</p><p data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.c">The Cavaliers&apos; struggles and LeBron&apos;s own up and down year have gotten in the way of these prophetic aspirations. But James&apos;s homecoming has made him into a far more sympathetic figure. And unlike the Heat, who practically begged us to hate them, this is a Cavs team many of us <em>want</em> to like. At first blush, the Heat were a mercenary killing machine gone horribly awry; the Cavs, on the other hand, could be a lot of fun if they ever got it together. That&apos;s where James finds himself now: Trying to rally himself and his fans not for reputation&apos;s sake, but to do right by everyone who invested so much in his 2014-15. He&apos;s not worrying about his legacy or his own past performance. LeBron James is just out to make everyone happy. And for once, it comes across as genuine.</p><p data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.d">Who knows how long this warm and fuzzy feeling will last. At some point, the Thunder will probably go white-hot, soar into the postseason, and scare the living shit out of whomever has to face them in the first round. This will happen and we&apos;ll forget all about OKC&apos;s adversity. The Cavs will eventually exhaust our patience and quite possibly take a mulligan on this season. At some point, &quot;what&apos;s going on with LeBron?&quot; could morph into &quot;what&apos;s wrong with LeBron?&quot; Lucky for them, they&apos;ll always be in the mix in the woeful East&#x2014;a security blanket of sorts, but hardly reassurance.</p><p data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.4.e">Unfortunately, only one of these two players can end up with the title we expected them to compete for. For now, though, it&apos;s exciting to watch them both have to fight and claw like mere mortals.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".2f9hccp51j4.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
