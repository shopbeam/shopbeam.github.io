  	    "articleBody": "The Internet blew up a few weeks ago when The Weeknd and Bella Hadid finally deigned to hold hands in front of paparazzi as they went on a date during New York Fashion Week. Now Hadid herself is even giving interviews about her \u0022new\u0022 boyfriend to the press. \u000A\u000ABut true XO fansâ€”as Abel Tesfaye\u0027s followers refer to themselvesâ€”already knew about these two long before the rumors started circulating about them in the mainstream and tabloid press. Unlike the rest of us, they didn\u0027t need the couple to appear in the same frame together. Instead, they were stringing their evidence together by screenshotting likes and comments between the two, or matching a man\u0027s jacket in one photo to another one. \u000A\u000ATheir relationship exemplifies the power that fans have when armed with the innate social media skills that elude the rest of us who grew up, at least partially, before the Internet was a thing. Social media fandoms have the power to break stories, like the recent Demi Lovato \u0022mugs are my favorite dish\u0022 incident, or to be the story themselves, such as when the Beyhive turned on their flawless leader after her Vegan diet announcement. \u000A\u000AYou\u0027d be surprised how much you can find by simply just searching their names onto Twitter/Tumblr/Instagram. Keep your DMs open, ALWAYS!Twitter\u000A\u000AThe Weeknd/Bella Hadid account @abelxbella, has been name-checked in The New York Times, and its meticulous documentation shows how no celebrity relationship is truly private, especially if you\u0027re showing your affection by double-tapping seven of your significant others\u0027 Instagrams in a row.\u000A\u000ATo get inside the obsession, we traded DMs with the anonymous proprietor of @abelxbella about the real timeline of The Weeknd and Hadid\u0027s relationship, and how they were on the trail before anyone else.\u000A\u000ALoadingView on Instagram\u000A\u000AWhy did you decide to make an Instagram account like this? I\u0027ve been a fan of Abel Tesfaye (The Weeknd) for a few years now and he had never date publicly or dated anyone in the public eye, so when I started speculating that he (Abel) was dating Bella, it came as a surprise. I guess the fact that they are truly unlikely pairing intrigued me, and made me want to know more.\u000A\u000AWhat makes them an unlikely pairing? Also how did you start suspecting that they were dating?Answer to first q: Through Abel\u0027s lyrics, we have learned a lot about his view of women, relationships and love. In fact he\u0027s often said he\u0027s \u0022immune to love\u0022 yet [I] get the feeling that he craves love, because he\u0027s never experienced it. Whereas Bella is a complete contrast. \u000A\u000ASecond q: At first they started liking each other\u0027s photos on Instagram, but I thought nothing of it. Then I saw pictures/videos of them together at Coachella, and it was at that point that I started speculating things. \u000A\u000ASo did you see Abel like a bunch of Bella\u0027s photos in a row through the Instagram follow feature? Is that how you started following Bella?Yes. I kept seeing that he\u0027d like about 7 photos at a time, some from a few weeks down her account, so he\u0027d obviously been on her page. I had been following Bella for a while prior to this as I had found her through her sister, Gigi Hadid.\u000A\u000AWhen did you suspect they started dating?  I started seeing the likes around March. It wasn\u0027t Coachella. It was before that. Abel posted a picture of Bella wearing a XO chain over her top, with no bra on. [The] XO fanbase went into a COMPLETE frenzy. It wasn\u0027t until Coachella that they even acknowledged Bella. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWhy did people hate the idea of him being in a relationship so much? What kind of messages would you get?     They (XO fans) are so passionate about Abel, they really do love him. So I guess it\u0027s hard for them to see someone they love, in a relationship. Part of [it] is jealousy but I also think part of it is that they don\u0027t want to see Abel get hurt. \u000A\u000AWas this on Instagram? Also would you say that most of his fan base is girls?  In reply to the hate message question: They were never serious hate messages, just people angry at me for making this account as they thought I was making things up. Some of them were really aggressive but I\u0027ve received so many positive messages since I\u0027ve made this account that I don\u0027t dwell on the small minority of hate messages. \u000A\u000AI wouldn\u0027t say that most of his fanbase is female, because he has [a] huge male fanbase too. I know so many males (that are straight) and 100% fuck with Abel and his music. \u000A\u000ALoadingView on Instagram\u000A\u000AIs this your first Instagram fandom account or do you run others? And what tips would you share for anyone who would like to gather evidence themselves?This is my first Instagram fandom account, I never actually thought I\u0027d run one but here I am!! Social media is the key for finding evidence, utilize that to your advantage. You\u0027d be surprised how much you can find by simply just searching their names onto Twitter/Tumblr/Instagram. Keep your DMs open, ALWAYS! \u000A\u000AWhen did people start sending in tips to you? Do you depend more on tips or do you try and find evidence yourself?   I\u0027ve always been open to DMs. Even since I started this account, I\u0027ve relied on other people giving me information/evidence a lot. I\u0027m one person so it\u0027s hard keeping track of them both. \u000A\u000AHowever, I do try and find new evidence myself. There might be a week where there\u0027s no evidence at all, so I don\u0027t spend any time on here, yet some weeks are just crazy! For example a few days ago Bella &amp; Abel made their first public appearance together, so now I\u0027m constantly on the lookout for pictures. Yesterday I probably spent over an hour just scouring the Internet for photos. If I find something that I think is good to post, I\u0027ll post it!  \u000A\u000ADo you ever interact with either Abel or Bella over social media? Do they know about this Instagram? Have you ever seen them together IRL?  They both know this account exists because Abel did an interview with New York Times where they made a reference to this account. Abel has never noticed me however Bella has replied to my DMs on a few occasions. \u000A\u000ALoadingView on Instagram\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve also never seen them together in real life. I\u0027m from a small town in the U.K. so I doubt that will ever happen but I would die (metaphorically not literally ðŸ˜‰ to meet either of them.) \u000A\u000AI\u0027m curious how you were able to track down certain information, like how you knew Bella was wearing Abel\u0027s jacket, or where her hotel was when she visited Toronto...If I see Bella wearing an item of clothing that I\u0027ve seen Abel wear before hand, I assume it\u0027s Abel\u0027s. I could be wrong, maybe they just share clothes? Or buy the same clothes? Hahah I don\u0027t know but the first one sounds more accurate. I knew Bella was staying at the Trump Hotel in Toronto because fans had met here there (and tweeted about it) and they said how she explained to them that she was only staying in Toronto for a few days. \u000A\u000ALoadingView on Instagram\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s funny though that there were so many private details hidden in plain sight on social media. Is Abel\u0027s tendency towards privacy something you keep in mind while running his account?Definitely. For example back in July someone hacked into Bella\u0027s email and released multiple personal photos of Abel &amp; Bella. It was at that point that I decided that I needed to keep their privacy in mind. I never posted the photos but it was frustrating to see how in the space of an hour they were all over the Internet. It felt like an invasion of their privacy and that\u0027s one thing I don\u0027t want this account to be known for.\u000A\u000AWhat have your DMs with Bella been like? What does documenting their relationship mean to you?  Bella\u0027s only ever replied with emojis. XO fans will always want to know about his relationships and personal life, whether they agree with it or accept it. I think that just comes with being a fan of someone in the public eye. Some are happy that he\u0027s found love yet some are scared that he\u0027ll get his heart broken. \u000A\u000AThis interview has been edited and condensed.",

data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.0">The Internet blew up a few weeks ago when <a href="../gallery/the-weeknd-kanye-west-yeezy-adidas">The Weeknd</a> and <a href="../gallery/bella-hadid-sexy-photos-bikini">Bella Hadid</a> finally deigned to hold hands in front of paparazzi as they went on a date during New York Fashion Week. Now Hadid herself is even giving interviews about her &#x201C;new&#x201D; boyfriend to the press. </p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.1">But true XO fans&#x2014;as Abel Tesfaye&apos;s followers refer to themselves&#x2014;already knew about these two long before the rumors started circulating about them in the mainstream and tabloid press. Unlike the rest of us, they didn&#x2019;t need the couple to appear in the same frame together. Instead, they were stringing their evidence together by screenshotting likes and comments between the two, or matching a man&#x2019;s jacket in one photo to another one. </p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.2">Their relationship exemplifies the power that fans have when armed with the innate social media skills that elude the rest of us who grew up, at least partially, before the Internet was a thing. Social media fandoms have the power to break stories, like the recent Demi Lovato &#x201C;<a href="http://greatideas.people.com/2015/09/14/demi-lovato-favorite-dish-mugs/">mugs are my favorite dish</a>&#x201D; incident, or to be the story themselves, such as when the Beyhive turned on their flawless leader after her Vegan diet announcement. </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.3"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>You&#x2019;d be surprised how much you can find by simply just searching their names onto Twitter/Tumblr/Instagram.

I guess the fact that they are truly unlikely pairing intrigued me, and made me want to know more.</p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>What makes them an unlikely pairing? Also how did you start suspecting that they were dating?</strong><br>Answer to first q: Through Abel&#x2019;s lyrics, we have learned a lot about his view of women, relationships and love. In fact he&#x2019;s often said he&#x2019;s &#x201C;immune to love&#x201D; yet [I] get the feeling that he craves love, because he&#x2019;s never experienced it. Whereas Bella is a complete contrast. </p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.a">Second q: At first they started liking each other&#x2019;s photos on Instagram, but I thought nothing of it. Then I saw pictures/videos of them together at Coachella, and it was at that point that I started speculating things. </p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>So did you see Abel like a bunch of Bella&#x2019;s photos in a row through the Instagram follow feature? Is that how you started following Bella?</strong><br>Yes. I kept seeing that he&#x2019;d like about 7 photos at a time, some from a few weeks down her account, so he&#x2019;d obviously been on her page. I had been following Bella for a while prior to this as I had found her through her sister, Gigi Hadid.</p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>When did you suspect they started dating?</strong>  <br>I started seeing the likes around March. It wasn&#x2019;t Coachella. <a href="http://adaptedtoxo.tumblr.com/post/117461758524/the-weeknd-x-bella-hadid">It was before that</a>. Abel posted a picture of Bella wearing a XO chain over her top, with no bra on. [The] XO fanbase went into a COMPLETE frenzy. It wasn&#x2019;t until Coachella that they even acknowledged Bella. </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.d"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/560ed84fe8a83977119f339f/master/w_806/Screen Shot 2015-10-02 at 3.17.10 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-10-02 at 3.17.10 PM.png"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-weeknd-bella-hadid-instagram-fans&amp;t=Screen%20Shot%202015-10-02%20at%203.17.10%20PM.png"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-weeknd-bella-hadid-instagram-fans&amp;t=Screen%20Shot%202015-10-02%20at%203.17.10%20PM.png" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-weeknd-bella-hadid-instagram-fans&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F560ed84fe8a83977119f339f%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FScreen%20Shot%202015-10-02%20at%203.17.10%20PM.png&amp;description=Screen%20Shot%202015-10-02%20at%203.17.10%20PM.png"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-weeknd-bella-hadid-instagram-fans&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F560ed84fe8a83977119f339f%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FScreen%20Shot%202015-10-02%20at%203.17.10%20PM.png&amp;description=Screen%20Shot%202015-10-02%20at%203.17.10%20PM.png" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>Why did people hate the idea of him being in a relationship so much? What kind of messages would you get?</strong>     <br>They (XO fans) are so passionate about Abel, they really do love him. So I guess it&#x2019;s hard for them to see someone they love, in a relationship. Part of [it] is jealousy but I also think part of it is that they don&#x2019;t want to see Abel get hurt. </p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Was this on Instagram? Also would you say that most of his fan base is girls?</strong>  <br>In reply to the hate message question: They were never serious hate messages, just people angry at me for making this account as they thought I was making things up. Some of them were really aggressive but I&#x2019;ve received so many positive messages since I&#x2019;ve made this account that I don&#x2019;t dwell on the small minority of hate messages. </p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.g">I wouldn&#x2019;t say that most of his fanbase is female, because he has [a] huge male fanbase too. I know so many males (that are straight) and 100% fuck with Abel and his music. </p><div class="embed instagram" data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.h"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="true" data-instgrm-version="2" data-type="instagram"><div class="instagram-media-container"><div class="instagram-media-wrapper"><div class="instagram-media-inner"><div class="instagram-media-view"></div><span class="instagram-media-loading">Loading</span></div></div><p class="instagram-media-more"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/2bvFWiHAw2/?taken-by=abelxbella" target="blank">View on Instagram</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Is this your first Instagram fandom account or do you run others? And what tips would you share for anyone who would like to gather evidence themselves?</strong><br>This is my first Instagram fandom account, I never actually thought I&#x2019;d run one but here I am!! Social media is the key for finding evidence, utilize that to your advantage. You&#x2019;d be surprised how much you can find by simply just searching their names onto Twitter/Tumblr/Instagram. Keep your DMs open, ALWAYS! </p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>When did people start sending in tips to you? Do you depend more on tips or do you try and find evidence yourself?</strong>   <br>I&#x2019;ve always been open to DMs. Even since I started this account, I&#x2019;ve relied on other people giving me information/evidence a lot. I&#x2019;m one person so it&#x2019;s hard keeping track of them both. </p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.k">However, I do try and find new evidence myself. There might be a week where there&#x2019;s no evidence at all, so I don&#x2019;t spend any time on here, yet some weeks are just crazy! For example a few days ago Bella &amp; Abel made their first public appearance together, so now I&#x2019;m constantly on the lookout for pictures. Yesterday I probably spent over an hour just scouring the Internet for photos. If I find something that I think is good to post, I&#x2019;ll post it!  </p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>Do you ever interact with either Abel or Bella over social media? Do they know about this Instagram? Have you ever seen them together IRL?</strong>  <br>They both know this account exists because Abel did an interview with <em>New York Times</em> where they made a reference to this account. Abel has never noticed me however Bella has replied to my DMs on a few occasions. </p><div class="embed instagram" data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.m"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="true" data-instgrm-version="2" data-type="instagram"><div class="instagram-media-container"><div class="instagram-media-wrapper"><div class="instagram-media-inner"><div class="instagram-media-view"></div><span class="instagram-media-loading">Loading</span></div></div><p class="instagram-media-more"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/5pIka9nAxN/" target="blank">View on Instagram</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.n">I&#x2019;ve also never seen them together in real life. I&#x2019;m from a small town in the U.K. so I doubt that will ever happen but I would die (metaphorically not literally &#x1F609; to meet either of them.) </p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>I&apos;m curious how you were able to track down certain information, like how you knew Bella was wearing Abel&apos;s jacket, or where her hotel was when she visited Toronto...</strong><br>If I see Bella wearing an item of clothing that I&#x2019;ve seen Abel wear before hand, I assume it&#x2019;s Abel&#x2019;s. I could be wrong, maybe they just share clothes? Or buy the same clothes? Hahah I don&#x2019;t know but the first one sounds more accurate. I knew Bella was staying at the Trump Hotel in Toronto because fans had met here there (and tweeted about it) and they said how she explained to them that she was only staying in Toronto for a few days. </p><div class="embed instagram" data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.p"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="true" data-instgrm-version="2" data-type="instagram"><div class="instagram-media-container"><div class="instagram-media-wrapper"><div class="instagram-media-inner"><div class="instagram-media-view"></div><span class="instagram-media-loading">Loading</span></div></div><p class="instagram-media-more"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/6j37IfnA_y/?taken-by=abelxbella" target="blank">View on Instagram</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>It&#x2019;s funny though that there were so many private details hidden in plain sight on social media. Is Abel&#x2019;s tendency towards privacy something you keep in mind while running his account?</strong><br>Definitely. For example back in July someone hacked into Bella&#x2019;s email and released multiple personal photos of Abel &amp; Bella. It was at that point that I decided that I needed to keep their privacy in mind. I never posted the photos but it was frustrating to see how in the space of an hour they were all over the Internet. It felt like an invasion of their privacy and that&#x2019;s one thing I don&#x2019;t want this account to be known for.</p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>What have your DMs with Bella been like? What does documenting their relationship mean to you?</strong>  <br>Bella&#x2019;s only ever replied with emojis. XO fans will always want to know about his relationships and personal life, whether they agree with it or accept it. I think that just comes with being a fan of someone in the public eye. Some are happy that he&#x2019;s found love yet some are scared that he&#x2019;ll get his heart broken. </p><p data-reactid=".1fns7ciam0w.1.1.0.0.4.s"><em>This interview has been edited and
