  	    "articleBody": "Anyone who\u0027s been handed a high school diploma can tick off the classic novels from the twentieth century: The Great Gatsby, A Farewell to Arms, The Grapes of Wrath. But cross into this millennium and things are suddenly murkier, Kindle-ier, less classed up with age. Then again, it\u0027s been an affirming thirteen years, enough time to breed a whole new body of post-2000 lit we\u0027re happy to call the new classicsand we\u0027re not afraid to name names. We spent months chiseling down a list* of not just our favorite books from the 2000s but also the works of fiction that we most readily recommend to our fathers, brothers, and non-blood-related bros. Then we asked a bunch of those authors to pick an overlooked bookstories, poetry, memoirfrom that same period of time. Dig in quick: This is your chance to right some wrongs and hit the new musts you missed the first time around.\u000A\u000A*Numbered, but not ranked\u000A\u000A1.  The Corrections, Jonathan Franzen (2001)\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABecause: Let\u0027s be real, he wrote two of the very best books (Freedom\u0027s the other) of the millenniumor, if you\u0027re guzzling haterade, at least the two best books on, among other things, family, anti-anxiety drugs, marriage, fate, songbirds, and Minnesota.\u000A\u000AAuthor\u0027s pick: \u0022Ms. Hempel Chronicles (2008), by Sarah Shun-lien Bynum, is a deftly constructed novel masquerading as a collection of linked stories; you don\u0027t even realize it\u0027s a love story until you read the last chapter. Its heroine, Ms. Hempel, is a young private-school teacher whose troubles include haziness about the distinction between student and teacher. Chapter by chapter, as you watch her interact with her pupils, you realize that she\u0027s as lost and confused as they are, and the result is an extraordinary sympathy for all concerned. Bynum seems incapable of writing a sentence that doesn\u0027t have something fresh or funny or true going on in it. She gets you laughing and then she whacks you in the heart.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A2. The Human Stain, Philip Roth (2000)\u000A\u000ABecause: he\u0027s written eight pretty great novels since the turn, but only one masterpiece. Beginning in the summer \u0022that Bill Clinton\u0027s secret emerged,\u0022 it\u0027s the best book on sex, scandal (Roth coined the famous phrase \u0022ecstasy of sanctimony\u0022), and political correctness in the Lewinsky Moment.\u000A\u000A3. The Road, Cormac McCarthy (2006)\u000A\u000ABecause: While plugging this book is sorta like plugging a weekend getaway to Pittsburgh in February, it\u0027s irresponsible not to, for the sheer tactful feat of turning a post-apocalyptic skin-crawler into both a critical stick of dynamite (the Pulitzer Prize) and a commercial windfall (Oprah\u0027s Book Club). McCarthy, who rarely lifts a fingernail to promote his work, is better than hermetic: Doesn\u0027t care about the fame or money but isn\u0027t such a nutbag that he frantically hides from it. He\u0027s operating in the new millennium as actively as the younger generation, this prime-time gunner, now 79, who so clearly has still got it. Notice, on the other hand, the absence of those other stalwarts of the 1960s1990s: Updike, DeLillo, Morrison, Pynchon, Ford, et al.\u000A\u000A4. White Teeth, Zadie Smith (2000)\u000A\u000ABecause: Smith\u0027s debut (published when she was just 24!)about the friendship and family fates of two polar-opposite and yet instantly identifiable British menis better than any recent book at answering the question: What was life like in London last century?  \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A5. True History of the Kelly Gang, Peter Carey (2000)\u000A\u000ABecause: the voice in this fictional autobiography of Australia\u0027s most famous outlawNed Kelly, bushrangeris so convincing that you\u0027d swear it came from his own dirt-and-blood-soaked hands.\u000A\u000AAuthor\u0027s pick: \u0022Kent Haruf is one of the great poets of the modern novel. He has an extraordinary capacity for love. He will give you the smell of the dirt and grasses of the High Plains of Colorado. He will never fail to engage your heart, but because he is an honest man, he will have you grasp the nettles. If you have never entered his beautiful singing sentences, I envy you your first time. If you do already know that Plainsong and Eventide are masterpieces, get ready for Benediction, out this year. This is why writers write and readers read.\u000A\u000A6. 2666, Roberto Bolao (2008)\u000A\u000ABecause: Big novels always arrive with an aura of ridiculousness, overpraised by critics, under-read by readers, slowly eroding an indent into the bottom shelf of your bookcase. Worse is a posthumous publication (which usually requires someone to defy the author\u0027s last wishes) that\u0027s as rickety as improperly assembled Ikea furniture. This book was both: the English translation of 898 pages showing up five years after Roberto Bolao\u0027s death from liver failure. But pick it up with two hands and you\u0027ll find a masterpiece just swarming with stories, of hapless critics and too many murdered women; earnest, haunted investigators who don\u0027t find the answers they need; and vanished geniuses who don\u0027t want to be found.\u000A\u000A7. Tree of Smoke, Denis Johnson (2007)\u000A\u000ABecause: The best book about Vietnam took thirty-odd years to brewresulting in the finest first few pages (and subsequent 600) written on the subject.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A8. Everything Ravaged, Everything Burned Wells Tower (2009)\u000A\u000ABecause: This is the voice lots of writers are most excited about today, the one whose story collection they\u0027ll hand you, dog-eared, if you ask for an urgently ass-kicking must-read. Spend a few hours with these damaged, defiant, uncomfortably familiar men (yep, including Vikings) and watch as Tower unravels and stitches up their lives. There\u0027s no way you\u0027re giving this book back.\u000A\u000AAuthor\u0027s pick: \u0022Haven Kimmel\u0027s A Girl Named Zippy (2001) is a joyous, humane memoir of a midwestern childhood, wrought in sentences whose epigrammatic hilariousness makes you want to applaud at each period. Recalling her early years, Kimmel writes, \u0027If I could have gotten my nose close enough I would have inhaled leaded gasoline until I was retarded.\u0027 For my money, this whups Proust and his doughnut any day of the week.\u000A\u000A9. Fortress of Solitude, Jonathan Lethem (2003)\u000A\u000ABecause: A lot of people write about Brooklynbut Lethem\u0027s epic take on gentrification and racial tension is the first and last word on the subject.\u000A\u000AAuthor\u0027s pick: \u0022The appearance in 2010 of What Is All This?a 600-page career-spanning anthology of stories from Stephen Dixonwas a welcome reminder of the continued existence of a literary cornucopia still steadily blurting out nourishment and fascination, now for fifty years and counting. Dixon\u0027s surely a candidate for the most prolific short-story writer of all time. Every one of his hundreds of tales long and short hinges on the singular miracle of his voiceas sprung and uncanny as Donald Barthelme\u0027s, yet as rooted in the urban vernacular as Bernard Malamud\u0027sand from there takes nothing besides that voice for granted, promising constant surprise. Read Dixon to be staggered by his humanity, fearlessness, comic despair, and formal genius. In my opinion he ought to get the Nobel Prize.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A10. Pastoralia, George Saunders (2000)\u000A\u000ABecause: The title story alonethe depressive ramblings of an employee in a vaguely dystopian caveman-themed amusement park (trust us)was proof that we had found a new king of literary tragicomedy.\u000A\u000AAuthor\u0027s pick: \u0022Stuart Dybek, an American master, is the literary embodiment of essential Chicagoness: deep emotion expressed in language that is street-smart, lyrical, and full of heart. The stories in I Sailed with Magellan are technically amazing, but always to emotional purpose. The book is full of the romantic, exotic, ethnic, story-rich Chicago I remember from my childhood. His story \u0027Hot Ice,\u0027 from the amazing earlier collection The Coast of Chicago, was the first contemporary story that ever completely cleaned my clock.\u000A\u000A11. Runaway, Alice Munro (2004)\u000A\u000ABecause: In any of the five collections she\u0027s put out since 2000, but especially in this one, she so totally nails the short story that one could be forgiven for thinking writing them is easy. It ain\u0027t.\u000A\u000A12. Austerlitz, W.G. Sebald (2001)\u000A\u000ABecause: Austerlitz is possessed of a form all its own. It\u0027s long been in vogue to blur the lines between fiction and non-, between novel and memoir, and W.G. did that before it was cool. But Austerlitz, which is basically about Sebald wandering around Europe, doesn\u0027t do it as a gimmick. You get the sense that this is simply what he had to write. Austerlitz is about the intricate, horrifying, inhuman destruction upon which all societies, certainly Western ones, are built. An understandable thing for a German to have been obsessed about. Its message is that we all live in the silent, beautiful ruins of sadistic disaster. And it falls to Sebald to uncover those ruins. To read it is to stop and smell the roses, except, you know, roses that smell like sadistic destruction.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A13. Cloud Atlas, David Mitchell (2004)\u000A\u000ABecause: Forget the endless movie: Mitchell\u0027s original novelsix rollicking story lines connecting disparate-seeming characters through  reincarnationwas big without being dense, and ambitious without being overbearing.\u000A\u000A14. Gilead, Marilynne Robinson (2004)\u000A\u000ABecause: Conversation about religion in America in the twenty-first century is so batshit insane that when someone tries to strip it down to the parts that were interesting to people, like, 2,000 years ago, it\u0027s worth listening. While Robinson\u0027s novela long, elegiac, wisdom-bleeding letter from a much older father to a much younger son that\u0027s also a meditation on just about every question of God and humanitysure ain\u0027t easy, it socks you in the face and then hands you some ice to cool the bruise. Which is what religion\u0027s supposed to do, right?\u000A\u000AAuthor\u0027s pick: \u0022I\u0027ve read a book that comes out this month. It is Christian Wiman\u0027s My Bright Abyss: Meditation of a Modern Believer. Wiman is the editor of Poetry magazine and has now accepted a professorship at Yale. His book is a memoir, his coming to terms with cancer and a very dark prognosiswhich he has outlived. The thing that is exceptional about this book, aside from its intelligence and its language, is the quality of its theological reflection. It is very lucid and not at all simple, a book in the great tradition of truly serious thought.\u000A\u000A15. The Art of Fielding, Chad Harbach (2011)\u000A\u000ABecause: Bros will never not love baseball and bros will never not love college and together, that pairing made us love reading a book more than the sum of our love of baseball and college. (Also: For guys who get through max two books a year, this is the surest rec on the list.)\u000A\u000AAuthor\u0027s pick: \u0022Sam Lipsyte\u0027s The Ask, from 2010, is my favorite novel of the past few years, and his new story collection, The Fun Parts, out this year, is just as good. Since 2000, the battle for Funniest Writer in America has been a mano a mano mountaintop clash between Lipsyte and George Saunders, and everybody else just stands around laughing.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A16. Netherland, Joseph O\u0027Neill (2008)\u000A\u000ABecause: Shoveling down the language in this bookabout a man\u0027s lonely assimilation in New York after his wife and kid leave him to move back to London in the wake of 9/11is like dining out gourmet for a week straight. Plus: murder, banking, spanking, andseriously, this will work on you, as anyone from the former Colonies has long insistedthe awesome draw of cricket.\u000A\u000AAuthor\u0027s pick: \u0022Skeletally, Leaving the Atocha Station (2011), Ben Lerner\u0027s first novel, is the chronicle of a young American poet\u0027s fellowship in Madrid. In substance, and not to mince words, this is a very intelligent, very funny, verbally brilliant, relentlessly perceptive investigation of the ethical-linguistic-political morass in which the American abroad must wade. Truly tip-top.\u000A\u000A17. The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot Diaz (2007)\u000A\u000ABecause: We\u0027ve never heard a book talk like this one: \u0022Dude, you don\u0027t want to be dead. Take it from me. No-pussy is bad. But dead is like no-pussy times ten.\u0022\u000A\u000AAuthor\u0027s pick: \u0022I guess I\u0027ll go for two. Aracelis Girmay\u0027s landmark poetry collection, Kingdom Animalia, because of \u0027Oh, body, be held now by whom you love. / Whole years will be spent, underneath these impossible stars, / when dirt\u0027s the only animal who will sleep with you / &amp; touch you with / its mouth.\u0027 And Alexander Chee\u0027s incomparable Edinburgh, because of its bravery, its wisdom, its vitality, and because it\u0027s a novel that never stops haunting.\u000A\u000A18. The Line of Beauty, Alan Hollinghurst (2004)\u000A\u000ABecause: Although the story is simplea recent grad spends the summer of \u002783 stumbling into his attraction to men while living in the home of a member of ParliamentHollinghurst tells it with the metronomic consistency of early Cheever, the wide-eyed sexuality of Updike\u0027s Rabbit series, and the bloodlust for men of wealth and class that launched Fitzgerald. And because Hollinghurst easily carries the torch for all three.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A19. Saturday, Ian McEwan (2005)\u000A\u000ABecause: No novel, by McEwan or anyone else, so precisely and gorgeously conjures the thought processes of its protagonist. Here the synaptic crackle and fizz of Henry Perowne\u0027s formidable brain as the neurosurgeon absorbs a body blow from a street thug: \u0022The blow that\u0027s aimed at Perowne\u0027s heart...lands on his sternum with colossal force, so that...there surges throughout his body a sharp ridge, a shock wave, of high blood pressure, a concussive thrill that carries with it not so much pain as  an electric jolt of stupefaction and a brief deathly chill that has a visual component of blinding, snowy whiteness.\u0022\u000A\u000A20. The Yellow Birds, Kevin Powers (2012)\u000A\u000ABecause: What happens when poets write novels is you get sentences with chiseled precision, chapters with an elliptical swirl. What happens when a soldier-poet writes a novel is you get the best book yet on the post-9/11 wars.\u000A\u000AAuthor\u0027s pick: \u0022It\u0027s not exactly underratedit was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2006but then again, poetry collections aren\u0027t exactly overplayed. Elegy on Toy Piano, by Dean Young, is a sad and vibrant shock of a book. Moving between the ridiculous and the sublime, often within the same poem, this collection is a perfect introduction to the reckless humanity of Young\u0027s poetry.\u000A\u000A21. The Namesake, Jhumpa Lahiri (2003)\u000A\u000ABecause: No other novel this century has so fully, meticulously described the life of a man, from birth to middle age, and all the choices and obsessions that guide him through it.",

Great Gatsby, A Farewell to Arms, The Grapes of Wrath</em>. But cross into this millennium and things are suddenly murkier, Kindle-ier, less classed up with age. Then again, it&apos;s been an affirming thirteen years, enough time to breed a whole new body of post-2000 lit we&apos;re happy to call the new classicsand we&apos;re not afraid to name names. We spent months chiseling down a list* of not just our favorite books from the 2000s but also the works of fiction that we most readily recommend to our fathers, brothers, and non-blood-related bros. Then we asked a bunch of those authors to pick an overlooked bookstories, poetry, memoirfrom that same period of time. Dig in quick: This is your chance to right some wrongs and hit the new musts you missed the first time around.</p><p data-reactid=".1kwcwz6t81s.1.1.0.0.4.1">*<em>Numbered, but not ranked</em></p><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".1kwcwz6t81s.1.1.0.0.4.2"><h2>1.

Its heroine, Ms. Hempel, is a young private-school teacher whose troubles include haziness about the distinction between student and teacher. Chapter by chapter, as you watch her interact with her pupils, you realize that she&apos;s as lost and confused as they are, and the result is an extraordinary sympathy for all concerned. Bynum seems incapable of writing a sentence that doesn&apos;t have something fresh or funny or true going on in it.

McCarthy, who rarely lifts a fingernail to promote his work, is better than hermetic: Doesn&apos;t care about the fame or money but isn&apos;t such a nutbag that he frantically hides from it.

The stories in <em>I Sailed with Magellan</em> are technically amazing, but always to emotional purpose.

It&apos;s long been in vogue to blur the lines between fiction and non-, between novel and memoir, and W.G. did that before it was cool. But Austerlitz, which is basically about Sebald wandering around Europe, doesn&apos;t do it as a gimmick. You get the sense that this is simply what he had to write. Austerlitz is about the intricate, horrifying, inhuman destruction upon which all societies, certainly Western ones, are built. An understandable thing for a German to have been obsessed about. Its message is that we all live in the silent, beautiful ruins of sadistic disaster. And it falls to Sebald to uncover those ruins. To read it is to stop and smell the roses, except, you know, roses that smell like sadistic destruction.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1kwcwz6t81s.1.1.0.0.4.11"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5591dcad92f8de6464367a95/master/w_806/books-13-15.jpg" alt="books-13-15.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-new-canon-the-21-books-from-the-21st-century-every-man-should-read&amp;t=books-13-15.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-new-canon-the-21-books-from-the-21st-century-every-man-should-read&amp;t=books-13-15.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-new-canon-the-21-books-from-the-21st-century-every-man-should-read&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5591dcad92f8de6464367a95%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fbooks-13-15.jpg&amp;description=books-13-15.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-new-canon-the-21-books-from-the-21st-century-every-man-should-read&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5591dcad92f8de6464367a95%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fbooks-13-15.jpg&amp;description=books-13-15.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".1kwcwz6t81s.1.1.0.0.4.12"><h2>13.

His book is a memoir, his coming to terms with cancer and a very dark prognosiswhich he has outlived.
