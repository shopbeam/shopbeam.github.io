  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Early this year, A$AP Rocky hit #1 with his debut album, Long.Live.A$AP. Tomorrow (August 20), A$AP Mob cohort A$AP Ferg\u0027s debut album, Trap Lord, will make it crystal clear—if it wasn\u0027t already from anthemic singles like \u0022Work\u0022 and \u0022Shabba\u0022—that he\u0027s anything but an understudy.\u000A\u000A Aggressive and spiritual, grandiose and sincere, A$AP Ferg is poised to bring the Mob to greater heights, while distinguishing himself as a fully formed force. He jumps between snarling bars and emotional sing-song verses, selects exotic and ethereal beats from a team of little-known producers, and wraps it all up in his trap lord brand. The Harlem native came to the GQ offices to talk about his album, his favorite designers, and what he thinks about that Kendrick verse.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A What went on during the filming of the \u0022Shabba\u0022 video that we didn\u0027t see on camera? And where was that shot, by the way?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: That was shot in Yonkers, at this castle-looking house. It was a crazy old crib, probably 2 or 300 years old. Dusty books, wood carvings in the ceilings, moose heads all over the place, it was just a beautiful, dope house. And besides that, just me being in bed with the two wonderful ladies, you know what I\u0027m saying? They had bikinis on under that, so my hands were kind of wandering under that mink sheet...\u000A\u000A You set out to make a mixtape and then it became an album, right?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: Well, the plan was to just work. They were calling it a mixtape at first, but I went into this project with thoughts of making an album. I never put out a demo or mixtape or anything, so this is my first impression to the world. I just wanted it to be great and grand.\u000A\u000A Which of the songs made you the most proud?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: \u0022Cocaine Castle.\u0022 I feel like everyone knows someone who\u0027s been hooked on drugs, and has vices they\u0027re fighting that are taking over their life. Growing up around drugs and crack houses inspired me to write that song. Harlem is known for a lot of people selling crack, and I just wanted to touch on that subject.\u000A\u000A As a \u0022hood pope,\u0022 what are three lessons you\u0027d give in a sermon?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: First, I would tell everybody from my hood that they can do what I did, which is make it out. I would also tell them to be themselves, and to venture off and see other things.\u000A\u000A You\u0027re a young guy but you\u0027ve already been a painter, designed clothing, and rap—is there a link between all these things?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: I\u0027m sort of like Jean-Paul Goude, the graphic designer who used to style Grace Jones and shoot all her visuals, just meaning that I use all mediums in one—music, fashion, and art. I\u0027m hitting it from all angles.\u000A\u000A You always have Marty Baller and Lord Tarz with you as your hypemen and fellow traplordians. What made you choose them?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: I felt like it was my time, and it was time for me to pull my little brothers up with me. You don\u0027t want to be in this game on top by yourself. I still have A$AP Mob around and I\u0027m helping everyone with their projects and endeavors, but these kids I practically raised and put them on the game. Marty went to the same school I went to, and Tarz, I practically raised him when he was younger. I just wanted to see them shine.\u000A\u000A You\u0027re one of the most exciting breakout artists of 2013; where do you see yourself in a year and five years?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: Wow... I\u0027ve got high expectations for myself. I see myself on top, doing what I love to do, and doing it the way I want to do it. No rules, just doing my own thing.\u000A\u000A This is GQ and ASAP Mob is huge in the style game; who are the freshest designers for you right now?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: I\u0027m really into simple things, things you could wear every day. I like lifestyle designers like Ralph Lauren, Alexander Wang, and Jeremy Scott. Jeremy Scott reminds me of Harmony Korine, mixing all worlds and making them into one—you just never know what he\u0027s up to. Alexander Wang is a young designer and his style is so profound. He took sports and street and kind of combined it into upscale high fashion. He made a white T-shirt a luxury. And Ralph Lauren just never gets old. I love his stuff. I painted my walls with Ralph Lauren paint, so I have suede walls at my crib—it\u0027s olive, but it has instructions on how to paint your walls to give them this suede effect. For him to think of that, I felt like that was an innovative idea.\u000A\u000A Tell me about the writing session you had with Waka for \u0022Murda Something.\u0022\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: That was so dope. Me and Waka, we really cool; we fam. We linked up in Miami to write, and the first day I was there with Jim Johnson and we didn\u0027t really come up with anything. The second day is when I saw Waka, and the chemistry of us being homies, we just said \u0022We\u0027re here, we might as well do a track together.\u0022 I never knew he was so into his work—he sits down with the engineer and he tells them what effects to do, what traps to make... He was telling me, \u0022Yo, Ferg, I think you could do this better,\u0022 and I would tell him, \u0022Yo, Waka, I think you should put this effect on your voice.\u0022 We were totally involved, and it was all good.\u000A\u000A How would you define a \u0022trap lord\u0022?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: A trap lord is basically the lord of the trap, and my trap is rap.\u000A\u000A Sometimes we call Michael Hainey, GQ\u0027s deputy editor, the \u0022trap lord.\u0022 Are you okay with that?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: Is he a hustler? As long as he\u0027s jiggy, I\u0027m cool with it.\u000A\u000A I also heard you might be cooking up some songs with GQ\u0027s own Stelios Phili.\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: Definitely, definitely in the works. He\u0027s one of the up and coming producers that I respect. It started off as a friendship, and it\u0027s always a blessing when you get to work with your friends and family. I\u0027m definitely looking forward to that.\u000A\u000A Last week Kenrick called himself the king of New York. What\u0027s your response?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: What\u0027s a king to a lord?\u000A\u000A Anything else we should know about the album?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: No, this is just about to be a great time for hip-hop, I think. A lot of the fun was taken away when people started dumbing down music and making only party songs, but I feel like my album has a lot more to offer. You can walk the runway to this music, you can use it as movie scores, you can clean your house to it, you can even play video games to it. I think it\u0027s going to inspire a lot of young kids to not be scared and just do what they really want to do.\u000A\u000A Yeah, especially with \u0022Hood Pope\u0022 there\u0027s really the feeling of you helping people out and being there for them. A pope is a father; do you feel kind of like a father figure?\u000A\u000A A$AP Ferg: Definitely like a father figure! When I was young, I always hung out with my pops and his friends before he passed away, so I was schooled to a lot of knowledge. I was advanced for my age, because I was doing a lot of grinding and working for myself. My father had a big crew, and all of his friends were like Puff Daddy, Biggie, and all of these people. He brought me around them, and I saw their lives and how they lived, and I was kind of prepared to help people now.\u000A\u000APhoto: Jace Lumley",

A$AP Rocky hit #1 with his debut album, <em>Long.Live.A$AP.</em> Tomorrow (August 20), A$AP Mob cohort A$AP Ferg&#x2019;s debut album, <em><a href="https://t.co/cFnGIv7yfU">Trap Lord</a></em>, will make it crystal clear&#x2014;if it wasn&#x2019;t already from anthemic singles like &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Es0sDqWnAZY">Work</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXZxipry6kE">Shabba</a>&quot;&#x2014;that he&#x2019;s anything but an understudy.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.2"> Aggressive and spiritual, grandiose and sincere, A$AP Ferg is poised to bring the Mob to greater heights, while distinguishing himself as a fully formed force. He jumps between snarling bars and emotional sing-song verses, selects exotic and ethereal beats from a team of little-known producers, and wraps it all up in his trap lord brand. The Harlem native came to the <em>GQ</em> offices to talk about his album, his favorite designers, and what he thinks about that Kendrick verse.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.3"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>What went on during the filming of the &quot;Shabba&quot; video that we didn&#x2019;t see on camera? And where was that shot, by the way?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.6"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> That was shot in Yonkers, at this castle-looking house. It was a crazy old crib, probably 2 or 300 years old. Dusty books, wood carvings in the ceilings, moose heads all over the place, it was just a beautiful, dope house. And besides that, just me being in bed with the two wonderful ladies, you know what I&#x2019;m saying? They had bikinis on under that, so my hands were kind of wandering under that mink sheet...</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>You set out to make a mixtape and then it became an album, right?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.8"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> Well, the plan was to just work. They were calling it a mixtape at first, but I went into this project with thoughts of making an album. I never put out a demo or mixtape or anything, so this is my first impression to the world. I just wanted it to be great and grand.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.9"> <strong>Which of the songs made you the most proud?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.a"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> &quot;Cocaine Castle.&quot; I feel like everyone knows someone who&#x2019;s been hooked on drugs, and has vices they&#x2019;re fighting that are taking over their life. Growing up around drugs and crack houses inspired me to write that song. Harlem is known for a lot of people selling crack, and I just wanted to touch on that subject.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.b"> <strong>As a &quot;hood pope,&quot; what are three lessons you&#x2019;d give in a sermon?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.c"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> First, I would tell everybody from my hood that they can do what I did, which is make it out. I would also tell them to be themselves, and to venture off and see other things.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.d"> <strong>You&#x2019;re a young guy but you&#x2019;ve already been a painter, designed clothing, and rap&#x2014;is there a link between all these things?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.e"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> I&#x2019;m sort of like Jean-Paul Goude, the graphic designer who used to style Grace Jones and shoot all her visuals, just meaning that I use all mediums in one&#x2014;music, fashion, and art. I&#x2019;m hitting it from all angles.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.f"> <strong>You always have Marty Baller and Lord Tarz with you as your hypemen and fellow traplordians. What made you choose them?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.g"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> I felt like it was my time, and it was time for me to pull my little brothers up with me. You don&#x2019;t want to be in this game on top by yourself. I still have A$AP Mob around and I&#x2019;m helping everyone with their projects and endeavors, but these kids I practically raised and put them on the game. Marty went to the same school I went to, and Tarz, I practically raised him when he was younger. I just wanted to see them shine.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.h"> <strong>You&#x2019;re one of the most exciting breakout artists of 2013; where do you see yourself in a year and five years?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.i"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> Wow... I&#x2019;ve got high expectations for myself. I see myself on top, doing what I love to do, and doing it the way I want to do it. No rules, just doing my own thing.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.j"> <strong>This is GQ and ASAP Mob is huge in the style game; who are the freshest designers for you right now?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.k"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> I&#x2019;m really into simple things, things you could wear every day. I like lifestyle designers like Ralph Lauren, Alexander Wang, and Jeremy Scott. Jeremy Scott reminds me of Harmony Korine, mixing all worlds and making them into one&#x2014;you just never know what he&#x2019;s up to. Alexander Wang is a young designer and his style is so profound. He took sports and street and kind of combined it into upscale high fashion. He made a white T-shirt a luxury. And Ralph Lauren just never gets old. I love his stuff. I painted my walls with Ralph Lauren paint, so I have suede walls at my crib&#x2014;it&#x2019;s olive, but it has instructions on how to paint your walls to give them this suede effect. For him to think of that, I felt like that was an innovative idea.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.l"> <strong>Tell me about the writing session you had with Waka for &quot;Murda Something.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.m"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> That was so dope. Me and Waka, we really cool; we fam. We linked up in Miami to write, and the first day I was there with Jim Johnson and we didn&#x2019;t really come up with anything. The second day is when I saw Waka, and the chemistry of us being homies, we just said &quot;We&#x2019;re here, we might as well do a track together.&quot; I never knew he was so into his work&#x2014;he sits down with the engineer and he tells them what effects to do, what traps to make... He was telling me, &quot;Yo, Ferg, I think you could do this better,&quot; and I would tell him, &quot;Yo, Waka, I think you should put this effect on your voice.&quot; We were totally involved, and it was all good.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.n"> <strong>How would you define a &quot;trap lord&quot;?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.o"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> A trap lord is basically the lord of the trap, and my trap is rap.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.p"> <strong>Sometimes we call Michael Hainey, <em>GQ&#x2019;</em>s deputy editor, the &quot;trap lord.&quot; Are you okay with that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.q"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> Is he a hustler? As long as he&#x2019;s jiggy, I&#x2019;m cool with it.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.r"> <strong>I also heard you might be cooking up some songs with <em>GQ&#x2019;</em>s own Stelios Phili.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.s"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> Definitely, definitely in the works. He&#x2019;s one of the up and coming producers that I respect. It started off as a friendship, and it&#x2019;s always a blessing when you get to work with your friends and family. I&#x2019;m definitely looking forward to that.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.t"> <strong>Last week Kenrick called himself the king of New York. What&#x2019;s your response?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.u"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> What&#x2019;s a king to a lord?</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.v"> <strong>Anything else we should know about the album?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.w"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> No, this is just about to be a great time for hip-hop, I think. A lot of the fun was taken away when people started dumbing down music and making only party songs, but I feel like my album has a lot more to offer. You can walk the runway to this music, you can use it as movie scores, you can clean your house to it, you can even play video games to it. I think it&#x2019;s going to inspire a lot of young kids to not be scared and just do what they really want to do.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.x"> <strong>Yeah, especially with &quot;Hood Pope&quot; there&#x2019;s really the feeling of you helping people out and being there for them. A pope is a father; do you feel kind of like a father figure?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.y"> <strong>A$AP Ferg:</strong> Definitely like a father figure! When I was young, I always hung out with my pops and his friends before he passed away, so I was schooled to a lot of knowledge. I was advanced for my age, because I was doing a lot of grinding and working for myself. My father had a big crew, and all of his friends were like Puff Daddy, Biggie, and all of these people. He brought me around them, and I saw their lives and how they lived, and I was kind of prepared to help people now.</p><p data-reactid=".2g3c4ni56v4.1.1.0.0.4.z"><em>Photo: Jace
