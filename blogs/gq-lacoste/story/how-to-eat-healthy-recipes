  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe verdict is in: We need to eat healthier. More veggies, more lean meat, less chemistry-set junk. And we\u0027re into that—we just need some inspiration. Luckily, the country\u0027s most interesting chefs are on our side, reinventing the idea of \u0022healthy\u0022 until it rhymes with \u0022damn tasty.\u0022 So we stole their favorite no-regrets recipes and techniques. Now go use \u0027em to make a mind-blowing meal out of something green (or red, or purplish, or all three).\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADevour the Whole Damn Veggie\u000A\u000AStarring the Do-It-All Beet\u000A\u000AThe next time you\u0027re hacking away at a beet (or radish, or turnip, or rutabaga), save the scraps. Brooks Headley, chef at Superiority Burger in N.Y.C., says they\u0027re actually your ticket to a full plate of mouthwatering sides.—Debbie Lee\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABreaded Beet Greens\u000A\u000A\u0022Chop raw beet greens and toss them in a smoking-hot pan for one minute, until they\u0027re gently scorched, then transfer to a bowl and season with salt, ground black pepper, and a sprinkle of chile flakes for heat. Dress lightly with olive oil and a splash of white-wine vinegar. Add a pinch of fine breadcrumbs—made yourself with good stale bread—and toss everything to coat the barely cooked, chewy leaves. The rest of the beet? Roast the root. Pickle the stems. You\u0027re using what others toss, so you can feel a little virtuous if you want, man.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASay Good Night to Eating Garbage\u000A\u000AOne unexpected downside of shorting yourself on sleep is that it makes you eat like a college freshman. Even one night without proper rest turns us into junk-food zombies. Our bodies crave sugary, fatty foods; our brains balk at considering the cons of double-fisting Oreos. Turns out the most important meal of the day is actually bedtime.—Jon Wilde\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMeet Your Salad\u0027s New Hero\u000A\u000ABlack-Garlic Vinaigrette\u000A\u000AEating healthier somehow, inevitably, involves salad. And a salad lives or dies by what\u0027s poured on top. Tal Ronnen, chef at L.A.\u0027s Crossroads and author of a just-released cookbook with the same name, understands. He believes in \u0022plant-based cuisine\u0022—cough, he\u0027s vegan—but no carnivore would leave his restaurant whining about rabbit food. Ronnen\u0027s darker, deeper vinaigrette is one reason why: It uses black garlic—an aged version of garden-variety garlic, and available at balsajo.com—to build in the tart-smoky-sweet, umami-rich flavors that hit your meat-eater pleasure receptors. You could pour it on a pound of raw spinach and go back for seconds.—Besha Rodell\u000A\u000ABlack-Garlic VinaigretteMakes About 1 Cup  \u000A\u000A½ cup white balsamic vinegar¼ cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, coarsely chopped6 black-garlic cloves2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped from the stems1 shallot, coarsely chopped1 tsp. agave nectar½ tsp. kosher salt⅛ tsp. freshly ground black pepperPinch red-pepper flakes¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil  \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADirections\u000A\u000AIn the bowl of a food processor, combine the vinegar, parsley, black garlic, thyme, shallot, agave, salt, black pepper, and red-pepper flakes and process for a few seconds, until the garlic is completely incorporated.With the motor running, pour in the oil in a steady stream, making sure it directly hits the blade for quick emulsification. The vinaigrette will be brown in color and somewhat thick.When ready to serve, warm the vinaigrette over low heat. Leftover vinaigrette can be kept covered in the refrigerator for up to five days.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAll Hail the Roast-Chicken Everything\u000A\u000ASee that $6.99 grocery-store roast chicken basking in the sunset glow of a red heat lamp? Unless you\u0027ve installed a pro-grade rotisserie next to your Mr. Coffee, you can\u0027t do better. So give in to what soccer moms have long known: that this somersaulting chicken is the healthier, helluva-lot cheaper replacement for a week\u0027s worth of lazy, greasy, MSG-filled takeout. \u000A\u000AYou can stretch those seven bucks over two, three meals. Use the breast meat in a lunch salad. Those twine-bound drumsticks? They\u0027re the centerpiece of an Asian stir-fry. And tacos! Try this recipe from food stylist Susie Theodorou, who\u0027s worked on cookbooks for Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Gordon Ramsay and still sees the beauty in grocery-store chicken.—D.L.\u000A\u000ASoft Chicken TacosMakes 3 Tacos  \u000A\u000A1 small red onion1 lime, halvedSalt1 avocado1 radish1 jalapeño1 roast chicken1 tsp. vegetable oil1 package Frontera Red Chile Enchilada Sauce3 corn tortillas1 bunch arugula  \u000A\u000ADirections\u000A\u000AThinly slice the onion into a bowl and sprinkle with half a lime\u0027s worth of juice and a pinch of salt.Chop the avocado, radish, and jalapeño.Pull the meat from a chicken thigh and a drumstick.Heat the oil in a skillet on medium-high, add the meat, and heat for two to three minutes. Then add ½ cup of the sauce and heat, stirring, for two more minutes.Wipe out the skillet and heat the tortillas.Assemble! Pile the tortillas with everything, including arugula, and squeeze on some lime and a little extra sauce.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ATHE FRY IS ALIVE! (JUST NOT THE POTATO KIND)\u000A\u000AGood news: Frying isn\u0027t so evil if what\u0027s being fried is healthy and the oil is packed with good-for-ya monounsaturated fats, as in sunflower and rice-bran oils. That\u0027s why you get a free pass for a seafood fritto misto spread like the one from N.Y.C. Mediterranean joint Santina (scroll down for the recipe), or these mayo-dipped chickpea fritters from chef Ari Taymor of Alma in L.A. that\u0027ll make you forget French fries exist.—D.L.\u000A\u000AChickpea FrittersMakes 30 Fritters  \u000A\u000A3¼ cups waterSalt1⅔ cups chickpea flour2½ tsp. corn flour1 garlic clove, MicroplanedJuice of 1 lemon1 bunch cilantro, finely choppedOlive oil3 egg yolks1 egg whiteZest and juice of 2 Meyer lemons4 cups grapeseed oilRice-bran oil  \u000A\u000ADirections\u000A\u000ABring the water to a boil. Season with salt. Whisk in both flours (add slowly) and cook 20 minutes.When the mixture resembles a paste, add the garlic, regular-lemon juice, and cilantro. Salt to taste and spread evenly on a 13 × 9-inch parchment-covered baking sheet rubbed with olive oil. Refrigerate.For the mayo: In a food processor with the motor running, add the eggs and lemon zest. Drizzle in the grapeseed oil until the mix gets really thick, then thin with Meyer-lemon juice. Set in fridge.Once cool, cut the chickpea sheet into rectangles.To fry, bring the rice-bran oil to 350 degrees. Drop in the chickpea rectangles a few at a time and fry until golden. Season with salt and serve with the mayo on the side.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABuild a Smarter Sandwich in Two Steps\u000A\u000AStep 1Don\u0027t Go Soft on Bread\u000A\u000AGreat news: Bread isn\u0027t dead. Yes, most supermarket loaves—even the stuff labeled \u0022whole wheat\u0022—are just preservative-pumped, nutrition-free white bread with a bad tan. But at new-wave bakeries like She Wolf in Brooklyn, throwback methods (natural sourdough starters, longer fermentation times) meet good-for-you ingredients (organic flours, sprouted-spelt grains) to make a loaf that actually brings flavor to the table. So hit up your local yeast-master and get rustic. Maybe snag a quality bread knife, too—you\u0027ll be slicing your own.\u000A\u000AStep 2Leave the Meat, Take the Broccoli\u000A\u000ANow comes the filling. Cold cuts are evil, but a slop pile of roasted vegetables is too close to obligatory Subway-style vegetarianism. Be brilliant and lazy at the same time by paring your sandwich down to a single star ingredient. Like...broccoli? No, not raw. C\u0027mon—no one\u0027s that masochistic. Chef Amanda Cohen of veggie-centric gastro-mecca Dirt Candy in N.Y.C. deep-fries the florets, then utilizes the stems—both pickled and in a creamy slaw (full recipe just below). You get plenty of dense, layered flavors, none of the pressed meat.—D.L. \u000A\u000AHot &amp; Juicy Broccoli SandwichAmanda Cohen, Dirt Candy, N.Y.C.Makes 2 sandwiches  \u000A\u000A½ cup peeled broccoli stalks, cut into rounds¾ cup + 1 Tbsp. lime juice2 Tbsp. sliced scallion1½ tsp. salt plus additional for seasoning4 peeled broccoli stalks, cut into matchsticks½ cup thinly sliced purple cabbage2 carrots, cut into matchsticks¼ cup thinly sliced red onion2 Tbsp. cilantro¼ cup mayonnaise½ cup + 1 Tbsp. unbleached all-purpose flour½ cup seltzer1 cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)Canola oil for deep-frying2 cups broccoli florets4 Tbsp. butter¾ cup piri piri hot sauce2 rolls or 4 slices bread  \u000A\u000ADirections\u000A\u000A1. For the pickled broccoli, combine the broccoli-stalk rounds, ½ cup of the lime juice, scallion, and ½ tsp. of the salt in a bowl and let sit for at least 10 minutes.2. For the broccoli slaw, place the broccoli matchsticks, cabbage, carrots, red onion, and cilantro in a large mixing bowl. Add the remaining lime juice and the mayonnaise. Mix to coat. Salt to taste.3. Set out two bowls. In the first, mix the flour and seltzer into a paste. In the second, place the panko and the remaining 1 tsp. of salt.4. Heat a heavy-bottomed pot of the canola oil to 350 degrees. (Use a thermometer to make sure—if it\u0027s not hot enough your broccoli will wind up greasy.)5. Dip the florets into the batter paste, roll in the panko, and drop into the oil. Cook until golden brown. Pull the florets out as the bubbles slow but before they stop completely.6. Combine the butter and hot sauce. Add the fried florets and turn to coat fully.7. Cut and toast the rolls. Repeat. Layer each with the pickled broccoli, broccoli slaw, and fried broccoli florets.  \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ANUTS SAFE FOR WORK\u000A\u000AYour job is stressful, boring, and on particularly bad days, both, which is why you find yourself staring at the office vending machine every afternoon at 4:17 p.m., choosing from options like Sweaty Trail Mix, Mom Cookies (only 37 calories!), and Sex-Toy-Sized Kit Kat. A better option: DIY your weekday-snack game with a weekend trek to Whole Foods for some all-natural, drawer-stashable bites. Remember: Stick to a snack-size handful. An open container very quickly becomes an empty one.—J.W.\u000A\u000AClockwise, from the top: - Dry-roasted nuts. Mmm—buttery, mineral-dense cashews. - Popcorn. And sprinkle with some addictive, cheesy, nutritional yeast. - Coconut. A pile of sweet, appetite-quashing fiber. - Goji berries. Nutrient-rich, and taste like smoky dried cherries. - Beef jerky. Get the all-natural stuff, packed with lean protein. - Candied ginger. Sugar-laden, but better than lab-grown candy bars. - Dried fruits. So tasty, so sugary. So go easy.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADear Egg, We Missed You\u000A\u000ATruth be told, we never stopped eating eggs, even when science swore that they were killing us. Now the lab coats have exonerated them and set us down a yolk-golden path of gastronomic joy. It turns out that chicken fruit doesn\u0027t necessarily crank our cholesterol levels—that it\u0027s actually stocked with good fats, filling proteins, and a GNC\u0027s worth of vitamins. To celebrate, we\u0027re putting an egg on damn near everything. Here, a simple visual guide to determine if what\u0027s in front of you can be improved with an over-medium egg topper.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMake It Grain!\u000A\u000APssst, there are good carbs. Really! (Thankfully!) They\u0027re grains, ancient ones—nutty and toothy, beloved by hippie co-op lifers and stat-crunching nutritionists. Rather than hype the health bona fides of these grains (high fiber, nutrient-heavy, and natural as hell), the smart man focuses on their chameleon ability to absorb flavors.—D.L.\u000A\u000AFive Paths to Grain Nirvana1. Ditch the empty-calorie arborio rice and make a risotto with farro, which adds a bit more bite.  \u000A\u000AToast pearl barley in a skillet before boiling it in veggie stock, then top with a thick blanket of pan-roasted parsnips and butternut squash.Use freekeh for a \u0027roided up tabbouleh. Mince every herb you can find—parsley, mint, basil, oregano—with garlic. Throw in a few chopped seedless cucumbers and cherry tomatoes. Dress with olive oil and lemon juice. Crumble in some feta. Devour.Find a soba-salad recipe, but sub buckwheat groats for noodles. Add any Asian-ish veggies (Napa cabbage, bok choy), thinly sliced. Toss in a dressing of soy sauce and rice-wine vinegar with a splash of sesame oil.Amaranth porridge! WAIT, COME BACK. The shiitake-and-thyme-laden bowl above from chef Joe Kindred of Kindred in Davidson, North Carolina, has the heft to fill a lumberjack. Here\u0027s the recipe:\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAmaranth PorridgeJoe Kindred, Kindred, Davidson, NCServes 4  \u000A\u000A½ lb. shiitake mushrooms, stems removed⅓ cup olive oil1 tsp. salt plus additional for seasoning1 small bunch of thyme sprigs plus thyme leaves for garnish2 cloves garlic, peeled4 Tbsp. butter plus additional for garnish1 cup amaranth3 cups low-sodium chicken stock  \u000A\u000ADirections\u000A\u000A1. Slice the mushroom caps into very thin strips.2. Pour the olive oil into a large heavy sauté pan on high heat. When the oil shimmers, add the mushrooms in an even layer.3. Season the mushrooms with the 1 tsp. of salt. Let the mushrooms get golden brown on one side.4. Add half the thyme sprigs to the oil, along with 1 garlic clove and 1 Tbsp. of the butter. Toss everything until the butter is foaming and you can smell the garlic and thyme.5. Pour the entire pan onto a sheet tray to let the mushrooms cool and to drain the excess oil.6. In a medium-size pot, heat the amaranth and chicken stock over medium-high and bring to a boil.7. Turn down to a simmer and cook until all the liquid is absorbed (about 15 to 20 minutes). At that point, remove from the heat and season with salt to taste.8. In a small sauté pan heat the remaining 3 Tbsp. of the butter on high. Watch closely: Just as the butter fully melts, add the remaining garlic clove.9. Stir the butter frequently, scraping the bottom of the pan. When you start to notice golden brown flecks—the butter solids browning—remove the pan from the heat, then add the remaining thyme sprigs to the butter.10. When the thyme and garlic stop \u0022frying\u0022 in the butter, remove them and scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any solids. Pour the butter into your cooked amaranth. Add the mushrooms.11. Divide into four bowls. Garnish each with a pat of butter and thyme leaves.  \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFinally, Learn to Eat Like A Lady\u000A\u000AAsk any yogurt commercial—women know more about food than you do. And though the socio-cultural reasons why are b.s., our indoctrination is your salvation. Because the best way to learn about healthy eating is to consult literally any woman. Who\u0027ll say…\u000A\u000AOf course that\u0027s bad for you.We know butter is not a carb. We know what contains B12. We know that three martini olives = a Swiss-cheese slice ·-· a baby carrot. Put aside your pride and just ask us if it\u0027s nutritious.\u000A\u000APay down what you owe.Eating is cumulative. And women implicitly know how to nullify a comfort-food bender with a next-day kale salad so that it never even happened. We can get you out of food debt.\u000A\u000APut takeout on a plate.Lame? Yes. An inefficient use of china? Sure. But upending an oil drum of pad Thai onto a plate lets you see how many human-size servings are in the thing. (Answer: like, three.) Satiation science agrees: Eat from a plate, it feels like a meal; graze from a take-out container, it\u0027s a bottomless snack.\u000A\u000AEat one whatever at a time.Ram 27 French fries into your mouth at once and you\u0027re done in five unsatisfying fistfuls, then stealing ours. Slow down and you\u0027ll scarf half as many—without having to burp to remember what you ate.—Sarah Ball\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFritto MistoSantina, N.Y.C.Serves 4  \u000A\u000AThe caper tartar sauce:1 cup + 2 Tbsp.mayonnaise1½ Tbsp. chopped gherkins (cut into ¼-inch chunks)2 Tbsp.

Combine all the ingredients for the caper tartar sauce. Set aside. (Tartar sauce can be made ahead and held for up to a week.)2. Combine the ingredients for the dredge. Set aside.3. For the sweet onions, pour the 2 Tbsp. of olive oil into a pan (ideally non-stick) and heat on medium-high. Add the onions, cover the pan with aluminum foil, and let cook for five minutes. Stir, and repeat until the onions are translucent but not burnt.4. Add the butter and salt to the pan, and stir until the butter melts. Then add the sugar and wine. Turn the temperature down to low heat and reduce until the onions are glazed. Adjust salt to taste.5. For the seafood, place the fish/shellfish in a bowl and cover with the sparkling water. Let soak for one minute, then pour off the water (but don\u0027t wipe out the bowl—a little water should stay behind).6. Add the dredge and vegetables to the bowl. Roll the fish and vegetables until they\u0027re evenly coated.7. In a deep pot or wok, heat the 4 cups of olive oil to 350 degrees (test the oil by dropping in one piece of shrimp; bubbles should form around it) and fry the dredged fish and veggies until lightly golden. Lay on a dry towel and season with salt to taste.8. Fry the basil leaves until crispy, roughly 10 to 15 seconds.9. Toss the seafood with fried basil. Add the sweet onions. Garnish with lemon slices and olives. Eat!",

<p><strong>Breaded Beet Greens</strong></p>

<p>&#x201C;Chop raw beet greens and toss them in a smoking-hot pan for one minute, until they&apos;re gently scorched, then transfer to a bowl and season with salt, ground black pepper, and a sprinkle of chile flakes for heat. Dress lightly with olive oil and a splash of white-wine vinegar. Add a pinch of fine breadcrumbs&#x2014;made yourself with good stale bread&#x2014;and toss everything to coat the barely cooked, chewy leaves. The rest of the beet? Roast the root. Pickle the stems.
