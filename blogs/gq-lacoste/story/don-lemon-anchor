  	    "articleBody": "So I say to Don Lemon, I say, let\u0027s do it, Don Lemon, let\u0027s have dessert. We\u0027ve been here awhile, eating lunch, and we\u0027re having a good time, so likable is Don Lemon, so open is he to my questions, so warm is his smile. And maybe he can be coaxed into it. We are at the restaurant at the Museum of Modern Art, and the portions are modern-art-sized, and he just had his photo shoot yesterday—he\u0027d suspended all manner of salt and other bloateries in the days leading up to it and would love to cut loose a little. But he still needs persuading, since it is a known thing that dessert is one of the principal sacrifices of people who regularly appear on TV. But he relents, because Don Lemon is not the kind of guy who will make you eat dessert alone. The negotiation: He\u0027ll do it, but it\u0027ll have to be light. I look up and down the menu and suggest that the sorbet looks promising, given his totally understandable criteria.\u000A\u000AHe leans in, big warm smile, not wanting to correct me, but needing to: \u0022Sorbette,\u0022 he says, like a news anchor. \u0022It\u0027s pronounced sorbette.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022Sorbette,\u0022 I repeat, shaky. I smile, not quite understanding the joke.\u000A\u000A\u0022Sorbette,\u0022 he says with the confidence of a man who informs hundreds of thousands of Americans each night about what is happening across this land as well as many others. \u0022It\u0027s pronounced sorbette.\u0022 Sorbette! Could he be right? I\u0027ve been saying it like a French word for years, like a complete asshole. Have I, a native English speaker, a graduate of a four-year college, a frequent eater of frozen desserts, been mispronouncing it all this time?\u000A\u000AOr we can leave room for the possibility that he is just plain wrong. This is Don Lemon, after all, the news anchor whose name has become associated with what might politely be called missteps, like asking an Islamic scholar if he supports the terrorist group ISIS, or declaring on the scene at Ferguson that there\u0027s the smell of marijuana in the air, \u0022obviously.\u0022 This is the guy who asked if a black hole could be responsible for the disappearance of Flight MH370; who asked one of Bill Cosby\u0027s alleged rape victims why she didn\u0027t stop the attack by, as he put it, \u0022the using of the teeth.\u0022\u000A\u000AYes, we have to allow for the possibility that Don Lemon might be wrong.\u000A\u000AAnd yet, and yet: When Don Lemon says this to me, I am sure that he is sure of it. And who can we turn to if not our news anchors?\u000A\u000ABut now here comes the waiter, and he asks if we\u0027ve decided, and Don Lemon asks for the sorbette, and the waiter looks at Lemon like, Are you joking? I give the waiter the silent, wide-eyed micro head shake—No, he\u0027s serious, proceed with caution—but the waiter has guts that I don\u0027t, and so he says, \u0022It\u0027s sor-bay, sir.\u0022\u000A\u000ABecause of course it\u0027s sor-bay. I am shaken from my stupor and remember that yes, for sure, absolutely, it is sor-bay. I am right. The man sitting across from me, smiling and confident—he is not right. And so I am relieved, but also nervous about what will happen next.\u000A\u000ABut Lemon is not embarrassed. \u0022Oh,\u0022 he says, and then nods, because you learn something new every day, and he doesn\u0027t look at me to say how embarrassed he is, he doesn\u0027t look with a gulp at the tape recorder, he doesn\u0027t attempt a joke to clean it all up. He just says, \u0022That\u0027s what I\u0027ll have, then.\u0022 And we move on. That he can say it, recover from it, and move on without needing to know what I think of it—this is sort of everything you need to know about Don Lemon: Don Lemon is human, and Don Lemon is not perfect, and Don Lemon is so much more fine with his humanity and his imperfection than anyone I\u0027ve ever met.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADon Lemon has a fitness tracker that he wears on his wrist, and he uses it for sleep monitoring. He\u0027s a lifelong insomniac, and his work schedule—hosting CNN Tonight at 10 P.M.—doesn\u0027t make things easier. Also he\u0027s dating someone now, a lawyer who understands his schedule, and it\u0027s going well—they spent Valentine\u0027s Day at a concert by the gay country singer Steve Grand—and there aren\u0027t enough hours in the day, are there? He shows me the tracker\u0027s attendant iPhone app, and his sleep patterns are impressive in a bad way: three hours sixteen minutes here, four hours there, two hours just a couple of nights ago. And that\u0027s total sleep, not what the device calls \u0022restful\u0022 sleep. In the weeks of data he shows me, the total never goes above six hours.\u000A\u000AYou wouldn\u0027t know it. Throughout our interview, Lemon, 49, is smiley and gregarious and energetic, alert but mostly expressionless, which probably comes from years of having to listen to people say crazy things on-air. He\u0027s an exceptional listener, my meandering questions returned in the complete sentences of a newsman who knows the power of a sound bite. He is focused when we talk, never strays for a minute; once, when I pivot away from a topic, he suggests that I might have ADD. This affable bluntness might help explain why he is so ascendant at CNN. His ratings are pretty close to Anderson Cooper\u0027s numbers at 8 P.M., and they have already eclipsed those of Piers Morgan, who was on at 9 P.M. until, mercifully, he wasn\u0027t.\u000A\u000AAs far as I can tell, the great Don Lemon gaffe-spotting fest that has become such an Internet phenomenon and journalistic pastime began on July 27, 2013, and it began not with a gaffe but with an unexpected rant about racial mores. He was anchoring the weekend desk, and he played a clip of that bastion of modernity and multicultural wisdom, Bill O\u0027Reilly, explaining everything that\u0027s wrong in the black community. This was shortly after the George Zimmerman trial, and rather than lash out at O\u0027Reilly, Lemon claimed that he hadn\u0027t gone far enough. He then addressed \u0022black people\u0022 with his own list of solutions: (5) Pull up your pants. (4) Stop using the N-word. (3) Stop littering. (\u0022I\u0027ve lived in several predominantly white neighborhoods in my life. I rarely, if ever, witness people littering.\u0022) (2) Finish school. (\u0022Stop telling kids they\u0027re acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English.\u0022) (1) \u0022Just because you can have a baby, it doesn\u0027t mean you should.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou can bury that kind of lecture on a weekend afternoon, but a shitstorm will still ensue. Critics pounced on Lemon, accusing him of blaming blacks for institutional racism. Lemon was surprised; he was just giving his point of view as a black man. \u0022I\u0027m speaking to the people from where I came from,\u0022 he explains to me. \u0022I didn\u0027t think I was saying anything bad. Just: Always respect yourself. Go to school. I mean—\u0022 and here he laughs a little—\u0022I think they\u0027re used to me just having a one-way conversation, just reading the prompter and going, \u0027Okay, what do you think? What do you think?\u0027 Maybe they were just sort of surprised that I actually have a point of view.\u0022\u000A\u000ASoon his platform grew. In March 2014, Malaysian Flight MH370 disappeared. He got the call that network president Jeff Zucker wanted to use the 10 P.M. slot for a nightly one-hour special to discuss new theories about where the hell that plane went, and he wanted Don Lemon to host it. (Good cocktail-party trivia: Nightline began the same way—a nightly update on the 1979 Iran hostage crisis that became a TV-news institution.)\u000A\u000AHere was his chance. Each night, he hosted a panel of aviation experts and theorists and gave updates on searches, but soon the searches were over, and so the updates gave way to just talking, and the hour became the sort of hour at which CNN specializes: long conversations that took the place of actual news, of which there was usually none. From a pure ratings perspective, it was a smart bet. Lemon immediately began crushing poor Lawrence O\u0027Donnell on MSNBC (still does) and even regularly held his own against Sean Hannity (ditto).\u000A\u000ABut it came with costs. CNN had installed its CNN-iest talent to anchor an hour of television that came to embody all the things that people loathe about CNN—the empty news-like product: questions, but no answers. Who knew anything new by the end of those hours? CNN\u0027s Malaysian-flight coverage became a punch line of flood-the-zone cable-news excess, and Don Lemon was the face of it.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADon Lemon knew he was gay for as long as he could remember. He knew it when he was watching Tom Jones on TV with his grandmother in his hometown of Baton Rouge when he was 5 or 6, and he knew it when he would watch Robbie on My Three Sons or the guys on Emergency! But he also knew that it was information he should keep to himself, because that\u0027s what you did in Louisiana in the 1970s.\u000A\u000AAs a child, he was molested by a teenage boy who lived nearby. He didn\u0027t tell anyone until much later; in fact, he came out publicly as a survivor of sexual abuse spontaneously and casually live on CNN, while he was doing a segment on another sexual-abuse case. That afternoon his bosses called to see if he was okay. \u0022Of course I am,\u0022 he answered.\u000A\u000AHe didn\u0027t have many close friends in high school. The black kids didn\u0027t think he was great at being black, and the white kids didn\u0027t want to bring a black kid into their sphere. Still, he was elected senior-class president: accepted by none but liked by all.\u000A\u000ALemon knew he\u0027d leave the South eventually, and he had always wanted to be a news anchor. His journalism teacher at Louisiana State told him he was aiming too high, that he\u0027d never make it on-air, which Lemon interpreted as being put in the \u0022black box\u0022—his term for the limitations others place on people of color. It didn\u0027t stop him, though. He got hired at Fox and shuttled between affiliates in St. Louis and Chicago for a few years, then jumped to NBC stations in Philadelphia and Chicago. He picked up an Emmy for a report on the real estate market and an Edward R. Murrow award for coverage of the D.C. Sniper in 2002. (Yes, Don Lemon has an Edward R. Murrow award.) In 2006, he jumped to CNN.\u000A\u000AHe claims not to have a political affiliation—he voted for Barack Obama in the past two elections, but in college he was a Republican and he voted for Reagan once, before Reagan\u0027s treatment of the AIDS crisis disenchanted him. But that doesn\u0027t make him a Democrat. \u0022People expect me to be liberal because I\u0027m gay,\u0022 he says. \u0022And I\u0027m not liberal.\u0022 But over lunch, when I describe his values as conservative, he objects to that, too. \u0022You keep saying I have conservative values. I don\u0027t. I think I have values that are important and realistic. And they\u0027re not necessarily spoon-fed by someone. I thought out what my values should be.\u0022 He brings up the example of family: He was raised by a single mother, and he loves her, but he thinks a family should have two parents. \u0022Even now my mom would say, \u0027I wish I had had some help.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ALemon has spent a lifetime so far out of sync with people\u0027s expectations of him that he seems unconcerned with them, sometimes even oblivious to them: of how a black man should act, how a gay man should act, how a survivor of sex abuse should act. All this—high school, the black box—made him into the man he is today. Someone who has learned that there are no guidebooks for a man as ambitious as he is, and who has no fucks left to give about what anyone thinks of him.\u000A\u000A\u0022Let me put it this way,\u0022 says Jeff Zucker. \u0022There\u0027s certainly a lot of interest in Don Lemon, and that\u0027s a good thing for Don and for CNN. You know, Don is a little bit of a lightning rod. Frankly, we needed a little bit of lightning.\u0022\u000A\u000ALemon\u0027s ecutive producer, Jonathan Wald, told me that \u0022none of the alleged dings at Don\u0027s performance have hurt his credibility or his appeal.\u0022 Lemon\u0027s gift, Wald says, is \u0022having a conversation, and that\u0027s really the guts of this show.\u0022 It\u0027s the mantra of all of CNN: Keep going, keep talking. People don\u0027t walk out on conversations.\u000A\u000A\u0022When you\u0027re a network-news anchor, you have a twenty-two-minute news hole, and you read not even five minutes of copy, if you read that much,\u0022 Lemon tells me. \u0022When you\u0027re a cable-news host, you\u0027re on for hours and hours and hours live. Right? Sometimes there\u0027s nothing in that box, no words.\u0022\u000A\u000AI went and watched those clips again, and it turns out none of them are quite as dumb as advertised. The black-hole question wasn\u0027t actually Lemon\u0027s question; it was submitted by a viewer over Twitter, and he passed it along to an expert, calling it \u0022preposterous.\u0022 In Ferguson, when he said \u0022obviously,\u0022 he was just (he tells me) employing one of many of the filler words an anchor uses when he has to fill in dead air. His ISIS question was intended as a point of clarification: \u0022His answer was so nebulous,\u0022 Lemon says of the Muslim human-rights lawyer Arsalan Iftikhar, who, yes, if you watch the clip, is not completely clear. Given the context, Lemon\u0027s follow-up—\u0022Do you support ISIS?\u0022—was only moderately daffy: Iftikhar was trying to give a nuanced answer, and there\u0027s no room for nuance on CNN. CNN is a place for sound bites. When I ask Lemon about his interview with the alleged Cosby victim and why he asked about the \u0022usage of the teeth,\u0022 he gives me a long answer about how the incident started a conversation about sex abuse. But it didn\u0027t do that, I tell him—it started a conversation about people who say the wrong thing to victims of sexual abuse. And shouldn\u0027t he have known better? After all, he was a victim, too. He smiles and shrugs and eats his food. Later, after dessert, I ask him again, and finally I get the real answer: Lemon tells me that when he was a child and was being forced to perform oral sex on his abuser, he told that fucker that the next time, he\u0027d bite his dick off, and that\u0027s when Don Lemon stopped getting molested.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s a thing we do now in the digital age where once we turn on someone, we find fault in everything they do, and in Don Lemon\u0027s case it seems to come from a less noble place than his not insignificant imperfections. Sure, he\u0027s said some dopey things, but lots of cable-news anchors say lots of dopey things. Why him? There\u0027s also something going on, something almost impossible to wade into and untangle, about a black gay man breaking with the rules of both groups, and so it becomes okay to make fun of Don Lemon in a way that it is not currently okay to make fun of any other black or gay public figure in America right now.\u000A\u000AAnd so here is maybe where I should confess to some sympathy. If you saw the transcripts of my interviews, you\u0027d wonder if English was my first language. Many of us who tell stories to the world have the luxury not just of an editor but also of a fact-checker and a copy editor. And how about everyone else? Very few of us have our conversations laid bare every single night. Hardly any of us are being recorded for stupid-thing-we-said Vine posterity. Most of us get to sound more or less how we want to sound; most of us get to backpedal. Not so on live TV.\u000A\u000AAnd remember, this is cable, not network news. Lemon\u0027s directive in many cases is to get up there and talk. On ratings-hungry CNN, there is virtually nothing you can say that is worse than silence.\u000A\u000AOne night, as I was writing this story, my Twitter feed came alive with two Don Lemon-related threads: first, that he had said, live on-air, \u0022Two hundred and sixty-two people are being held by ISIS, many of them men, women, and children,\u0022 and second, that he was interviewing a llama.\u000A\u000AI turned on my taped version of the broadcast, and it was immediately clear that Lemon had just misspoken: He had already said the phrase \u0022ISIS now holds more than 260 Christian hostages—men, women, children, and the elderly\u0022 during that hour—it was only the second time that he absently substituted the phrase \u0022many of them.\u0022 And for the record, he didn\u0027t interview the llama; he interviewed the llama\u0027s handler, because earlier that day the world had been captivated by an animal escape (\u0022llama drama,\u0022 in CNN parlance) in Arizona.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABut look at the pictures of Lemon next to that llama. They\u0027re irresistible, both of them staring at the camera, both of them expressionless. They are begging for a hashtag. This is 2015, and we live in an age of tweets and GIFs designed to make jokes out of people, and Don Lemon seems custom-built for perpetuating what we\u0027ve decided is his essential Don Lemonness. As he stood next to that llama, I detected something like regret or humiliation behind his eyes, but he\u0027ll never let us see more than a flicker, if that. No, Don Lemon isn\u0027t Murrow or Cronkite. He may not be the steady, infallible news anchor America needs right now. But he sure feels like the anchor we deserve.\u000A\u000AWe turn on who we turn on, I guess, and we delight in other people\u0027s mistakes, all the more so when there doesn\u0027t appear to be much contrition or self-awareness about their impact. And anyway, no one is perfect. Not him, not me with my flawless dessert pronunciation. That afternoon at the restaurant, Lemon checked out a couple of cute waiters, making aren\u0027t-you-delicious noises as they walked by, loudly enough for me to hear, still not giving a shit. Then he put his sorbet spoon down on his plate and smiled and said, \u0022That was good,\u0022 and that was that.\u000A\u000ATaffy Brodesser-Akner (@taffyakner) is a GQ  correspondent",

We&#x2019;ve been here awhile, eating lunch, and we&#x2019;re having a good time, so likable is Don Lemon, so open is he to my questions, so warm is his smile. And maybe he can be coaxed into it. We are at the restaurant at the Museum of Modern Art, and the portions are modern-art-sized, and he just had his photo shoot yesterday&#x2014;he&#x2019;d suspended all manner of salt and other bloateries in the days leading up to it and would love to cut loose a little. But he still needs persuading, since it is a known thing that dessert is one of the principal sacrifices of people who regularly appear on TV. But he relents, because Don Lemon is not the kind of guy who will make you eat dessert alone. The negotiation: He&#x2019;ll do it, but it&#x2019;ll have to be light. I look up and down the menu and suggest that the sorbet looks promising, given his totally understandable criteria.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.1">He leans in, big warm smile, not wanting to correct me, but needing to: &quot;Sorbette,&quot; he says, like a news anchor. &quot;It&#x2019;s pronounced sorbette.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.2">&quot;Sorbette,&quot; I repeat, shaky. I smile, not quite understanding the joke.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.3">&quot;Sorbette,&quot; he says with the confidence of a man who informs hundreds of thousands of Americans each night about what is happening across this land as well as many others. &quot;It&#x2019;s pronounced sorbette.&quot; Sorbette! Could he be right? I&#x2019;ve been saying it like a French word for years, like a complete asshole. Have I, a native English speaker, a graduate of a four-year college, a frequent eater of frozen desserts, been mispronouncing it all this time?</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.5">Or we can leave room for the possibility that he is just plain wrong. This is Don Lemon, after all, the news anchor whose name has become associated with what might politely be called <em>missteps,</em> like asking an Islamic scholar if he supports the terrorist group ISIS, or declaring on the scene at Ferguson that there&#x2019;s the smell of marijuana in the air, &quot;obviously.&quot; This is the guy who asked if a black hole could be responsible for the disappearance of Flight MH370; who asked one of Bill Cosby&#x2019;s alleged rape victims why she didn&#x2019;t stop the attack by, as he put it, &quot;the using of the teeth.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.6">Yes, we have to allow for the possibility that Don Lemon might be wrong.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.7">And yet, and yet: When Don Lemon says this to me, I am sure that he is sure of it. And who can we turn to if not our news anchors?</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.8">But now here comes the waiter, and he asks if we&#x2019;ve decided, and Don Lemon asks for the sorbette, and the waiter looks at Lemon like, <em>Are you joking?</em> I give the waiter the silent, wide-eyed micro head shake&#x2014;<em>No, he&#x2019;s serious, proceed with caution</em>&#x2014;but the waiter has guts that I don&#x2019;t, and so he says, &quot;It&#x2019;s sor-<em>bay,</em> sir.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.9">Because of course it&#x2019;s sor-<em>bay.</em> I am shaken from my stupor and remember that yes, for sure, absolutely, it is sor-<em>bay.</em> I am right. The man sitting across from me, smiling and confident&#x2014;he is not right. And so I am relieved, but also nervous about what will happen next.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.a">But Lemon is not embarrassed. &quot;Oh,&quot; he says, and then nods, because you learn something new every day, and he doesn&#x2019;t look at me to say how embarrassed he is, he doesn&#x2019;t look with a gulp at the tape recorder, he doesn&#x2019;t attempt a joke to clean it all up. He just says, &quot;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ll have, then.&quot; And we move on. That he can say it, recover from it, and move on without needing to know what I think of it&#x2014;this is sort of everything you need to know about Don Lemon: Don Lemon is human, and Don Lemon is not perfect, and Don Lemon is so much more fine with his humanity and his imperfection than anyone I&#x2019;ve ever met.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.b"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.c"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c9501177d66d68d589dc/master/w_806/entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-comp.jpg" alt="entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-comp.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;t=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-comp.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;t=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-comp.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9501177d66d68d589dc%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-comp.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-comp.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9501177d66d68d589dc%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-comp.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-comp.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.d">Don Lemon has a fitness tracker that he wears on his wrist, and he uses it for sleep monitoring.

Also he&#x2019;s dating someone now, a lawyer who understands his schedule, and it&#x2019;s going well&#x2014;they spent Valentine&#x2019;s Day at a concert by the gay country singer Steve Grand&#x2014;and there aren&#x2019;t enough hours in the day, are there? He shows me the tracker&#x2019;s attendant iPhone app, and his sleep patterns are impressive in a bad way: three hours sixteen minutes here, four hours there, two hours just a couple of nights ago. And that&#x2019;s total sleep, not what the device calls &quot;restful&quot; sleep. In the weeks of data he shows me, the total never goes above six hours.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.e">You wouldn&#x2019;t know it. Throughout our interview, Lemon, 49, is smiley and gregarious and energetic, alert but mostly expressionless, which probably comes from years of having to listen to people say crazy things on-air. He&#x2019;s an exceptional listener, my meandering questions returned in the complete sentences of a newsman who knows the power of a sound bite. He is focused when we talk, never strays for a minute; once, when I pivot away from a topic, he suggests that I might have ADD. This affable bluntness might help explain why he is so ascendant at CNN. His ratings are pretty close to Anderson Cooper&#x2019;s numbers at 8 P.M., and they have already eclipsed those of Piers Morgan, who was on at 9 P.M. until, mercifully, he wasn&#x2019;t.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.f">As far as I can tell, the great Don Lemon gaffe-spotting fest that has become such an Internet phenomenon and journalistic pastime began on July 27, 2013, and it began not with a gaffe but with an unexpected rant about racial mores. He was anchoring the weekend desk, and he played a clip of that bastion of modernity and multicultural wisdom, Bill O&#x2019;Reilly, explaining everything that&#x2019;s wrong in the black community. This was shortly after the George Zimmerman trial, and rather than lash out at O&#x2019;Reilly, Lemon claimed that he hadn&#x2019;t gone far enough. He then addressed &quot;black people&quot; with his own list of solutions: <em>(5)</em> Pull up your pants. <em>(4)</em> Stop using the N-word. <em>(3)</em> Stop littering. (&quot;I&#x2019;ve lived in several predominantly white neighborhoods in my life. I rarely, if ever, witness people littering.&quot;) <em>(2)</em> Finish school. (&quot;Stop telling kids they&#x2019;re acting white because they go to school or they speak proper English.&quot;) <em>(1)</em> &quot;Just because you can have a baby, it doesn&#x2019;t mean you should.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.g">You can bury that kind of lecture on a weekend afternoon, but a shitstorm will still ensue. Critics pounced on Lemon, accusing him of blaming blacks for institutional racism. Lemon was surprised; he was just giving his point of view as a black man. &quot;I&#x2019;m speaking to the people from where I came from,&quot; he explains to me. &quot;I didn&#x2019;t think I was saying anything bad. Just: Always respect yourself. Go to school. I mean&#x2014;&quot; and here he laughs a little&#x2014;&quot;I think they&#x2019;re used to me just having a one-way conversation, just reading the prompter and going, &#x2019;Okay, what do you think? What do you think?&#x2019; Maybe they were just sort of surprised that I actually have a point of view.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.h">Soon his platform grew. In March 2014, Malaysian Flight MH370 disappeared. He got the call that network president Jeff Zucker wanted to use the 10 P.M. slot for a nightly one-hour special to discuss new theories about where the hell that plane went, and he wanted Don Lemon to host it. (Good cocktail-party trivia: <em>Nightline</em> began the same way&#x2014;a nightly update on the 1979 Iran hostage crisis that became a TV-news institution.)</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.i">Here was his chance. Each night, he hosted a panel of aviation experts and theorists and gave updates on searches, but soon the searches were over, and so the updates gave way to just talking, and the hour became the sort of hour at which CNN specializes: long conversations that took the place of actual news, of which there was usually none. From a pure ratings perspective, it was a smart bet. Lemon immediately began crushing poor Lawrence O&#x2019;Donnell on MSNBC (still does) and even regularly held his own against Sean Hannity (ditto).</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.j">But it came with costs. CNN had installed its CNN-iest talent to anchor an hour of television that came to embody all the things that people loathe about CNN&#x2014;the empty news-like product: questions, but no answers. Who knew anything new by the end of those hours? CNN&#x2019;s Malaysian-flight coverage became a punch line of flood-the-zone cable-news excess, and Don Lemon was the face of it.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.k"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.l">Don Lemon knew he was gay for as long as he could remember. He knew it when he was watching Tom Jones on TV with his grandmother in his hometown of Baton Rouge when he was 5 or 6, and he knew it when he would watch Robbie on <em>My Three Sons</em> or the guys on <em>Emergency!</em> But he also knew that it was information he should keep to himself, because that&#x2019;s what you did in Louisiana in the 1970s.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.m">As a child, he was molested by a teenage boy who lived nearby. He didn&#x2019;t tell anyone until much later; in fact, he came out publicly as a survivor of sexual abuse spontaneously and casually live on CNN, while he was doing a segment on another sexual-abuse case. That afternoon his bosses called to see if he was okay. &quot;Of course I am,&quot; he answered.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.n">He didn&#x2019;t have many close friends in high school. The black kids didn&#x2019;t think he was great at being black, and the white kids didn&#x2019;t want to bring a black kid into their sphere. Still, he was elected senior-class president: accepted by none but liked by all.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.o">Lemon knew he&#x2019;d leave the South eventually, and he had always wanted to be a news anchor. His journalism teacher at Louisiana State told him he was aiming too high, that he&#x2019;d never make it on-air, which Lemon interpreted as being put in the &quot;black box&quot;&#x2014;his term for the limitations others place on people of color. It didn&#x2019;t stop him, though. He got hired at Fox and shuttled between affiliates in St. Louis and Chicago for a few years, then jumped to NBC stations in Philadelphia and Chicago. He picked up an Emmy for a report on the real estate market and an Edward R. Murrow award for coverage of the D.C. Sniper in 2002. (Yes, Don Lemon has an Edward R. Murrow award.) In 2006, he jumped to CNN.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.p">He claims not to have a political affiliation&#x2014;he voted for Barack Obama in the past two elections, but in college he was a Republican and he voted for Reagan once, before Reagan&#x2019;s treatment of the AIDS crisis disenchanted him. But that doesn&#x2019;t make him a Democrat. &quot;People expect me to be liberal because I&#x2019;m gay,&quot; he says. &quot;And I&#x2019;m not liberal.&quot; But over lunch, when I describe his values as conservative, he objects to that, too. &quot;You keep saying I have conservative values. I don&#x2019;t. I think I have values that are important and realistic. And they&#x2019;re not necessarily spoon-fed by someone. I thought out what my values should be.&quot; He brings up the example of family: He was raised by a single mother, and he loves her, but he thinks a family should have two parents. &quot;Even now my mom would say, &#x2019;I wish I had had some help.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.q">Lemon has spent a lifetime so far out of sync with people&#x2019;s expectations of him that he seems unconcerned with them, sometimes even oblivious to them: of how a black man should act, how a gay man should act, how a survivor of sex abuse should act. All this&#x2014;high school, the black box&#x2014;made him into the man he is today. Someone who has learned that there are no guidebooks for a man as ambitious as he is, and who has no fucks left to give about what anyone thinks of him.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.r">&quot;Let me put it this way,&quot; says Jeff Zucker. &quot;There&#x2019;s certainly a lot of interest in Don Lemon, and that&#x2019;s a good thing for Don and for CNN. You know, Don is a little bit of a lightning rod. Frankly, we needed a little bit of lightning.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.s">Lemon&#x2019;s ecutive producer, Jonathan Wald, told me that &quot;none of the alleged dings at Don&#x2019;s performance have hurt his credibility or his appeal.&quot; Lemon&#x2019;s gift, Wald says, is &quot;having a conversation, and that&#x2019;s really the guts of this show.&quot; It&#x2019;s the mantra of all of CNN: Keep going, keep talking. People don&#x2019;t walk out on conversations.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.t">&quot;When you&#x2019;re a network-news anchor, you have a twenty-two-minute news hole, and you read not even five minutes of copy, if you read that much,&quot; Lemon tells me. &quot;When you&#x2019;re a cable-news host, you&#x2019;re on for hours and hours and hours live. Right? Sometimes there&#x2019;s nothing in that box, no words.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.u">I went and watched those clips again, and it turns out none of them are quite as dumb as advertised. The black-hole question wasn&#x2019;t actually Lemon&#x2019;s question; it was submitted by a viewer over Twitter, and he passed it along to an expert, calling it &quot;preposterous.&quot; In Ferguson, when he said &quot;obviously,&quot; he was just (he tells me) employing one of many of the filler words an anchor uses when he has to fill in dead air. His ISIS question was intended as a point of clarification: &quot;His answer was so nebulous,&quot; Lemon says of the Muslim human-rights lawyer Arsalan Iftikhar, who, yes, if you watch the clip, is not completely clear. Given the context, Lemon&#x2019;s follow-up&#x2014;&quot;Do <em>you</em> support ISIS?&quot;&#x2014;was only moderately daffy: Iftikhar was trying to give a nuanced answer, and there&#x2019;s no room for nuance on CNN. CNN is a place for sound bites. When I ask Lemon about his interview with the alleged Cosby victim and why he asked about the &quot;usage of the teeth,&quot; he gives me a long answer about how the incident started a conversation about sex abuse. But it didn&#x2019;t do that, I tell him&#x2014;it started a conversation about people who say the wrong thing to victims of sexual abuse. And shouldn&#x2019;t he have known better? After all, he was a victim, too. He smiles and shrugs and eats his food. Later, after dessert, I ask him again, and finally I get the real answer: Lemon tells me that when he was a child and was being forced to perform oral sex on his abuser, he told that fucker that the next time, he&#x2019;d bite his dick off, and that&#x2019;s when Don Lemon stopped getting molested.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.v"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.w"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c9501177d66d68d589de/master/w_806/entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-09.jpg" alt="entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-09.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;t=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-09.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;t=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-09.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9501177d66d68d589de%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-09.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-09.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9501177d66d68d589de%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-09.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-09.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.x">There&#x2019;s a thing we do now in the digital age where once we turn on someone, we find fault in everything they do, and in Don Lemon&#x2019;s case it seems to come from a less noble place than his not insignificant imperfections. Sure, he&#x2019;s said some dopey things, but lots of cable-news anchors say lots of dopey things. Why him? There&#x2019;s also something going on, something almost impossible to wade into and untangle, about a black gay man breaking with the rules of both groups, and so it becomes okay to make fun of Don Lemon in a way that it is not currently okay to make fun of any other black or gay public figure in America right now.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.y">And so here is maybe where I should confess to some sympathy. If you saw the transcripts of my interviews, you&#x2019;d wonder if English was my first language. Many of us who tell stories to the world have the luxury not just of an editor but also of a fact-checker and a copy editor. And how about everyone else? Very few of us have our conversations laid bare every single night. Hardly any of us are being recorded for stupid-thing-we-said Vine posterity. Most of us get to sound more or less how we want to sound; most of us get to backpedal. Not so on live TV.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.z">And remember, this is cable, not network news. Lemon&#x2019;s directive in many cases is to get up there and talk. On ratings-hungry CNN, there is virtually nothing you can say that is worse than silence.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.10">One night, as I was writing this story, my Twitter feed came alive with two Don Lemon-related threads: first, that he had said, live on-air, &quot;Two hundred and sixty-two people are being held by ISIS, many of them men, women, and children,&quot; and second, that he was interviewing a llama.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.11">I turned on my taped version of the broadcast, and it was immediately clear that Lemon had just misspoken: He had already said the phrase &quot;ISIS now holds more than 260 Christian hostages&#x2014;men, women, children, and the elderly&quot; during that hour&#x2014;it was only the second time that he absently substituted the phrase &quot;many of them.&quot; And for the record, he didn&#x2019;t interview the llama; he interviewed the llama&#x2019;s <em>handler,</em> because earlier that day the world had been captivated by an animal escape (&quot;llama drama,&quot; in CNN parlance) in Arizona.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.12"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582c9511177d66d68d589e2/master/w_600/entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-08.jpg" alt="entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-08.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;t=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-08.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;t=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-08.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9511177d66d68d589e2%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-08.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-08.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fdon-lemon-anchor&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582c9511177d66d68d589e2%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-08.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2015-05-don-lemon-don-lemon-gq-magazine-may-2015-08.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.13">But look at the pictures of Lemon next to that llama. They&#x2019;re irresistible, both of them staring at the camera, both of them expressionless. They are begging for a hashtag. This is 2015, and we live in an age of tweets and GIFs designed to make jokes out of people, and Don Lemon seems custom-built for perpetuating what we&#x2019;ve decided is his essential Don Lemonness. As he stood next to that llama, I detected something like regret or humiliation behind his eyes, but he&#x2019;ll never let us see more than a flicker, if that. No, Don Lemon isn&#x2019;t Murrow or Cronkite. He may not be the steady, infallible news anchor America needs right now. But he sure feels like the anchor we deserve.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.14">We turn on who we turn on, I guess, and we delight in other people&#x2019;s mistakes, all the more so when there doesn&#x2019;t appear to be much contrition or self-awareness about their impact. And anyway, no one is perfect. Not him, not me with my flawless dessert pronunciation. That afternoon at the restaurant, Lemon checked out a couple of cute waiters, making aren&#x2019;t-you-delicious noises as they walked by, loudly enough for me to hear, still not giving a shit. Then he put his sorbet spoon down on his plate and smiled and said, &quot;That was good,&quot; and that was that.</p><p data-reactid=".3uc7q3mi2o.1.1.0.0.4.15"><em><a
