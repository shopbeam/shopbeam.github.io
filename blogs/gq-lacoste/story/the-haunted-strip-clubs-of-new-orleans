  	    "articleBody": "On the first floor of most French Quarter strip clubs, the energy isn\u0027t that much different from other dens of sexy dancing scattered across America. There\u0027s the thump-thump of a club remix, criminally overpriced drinks, and—of course—half-naked women with names like Dynasty popping and locking with varying levels of enthusiasm. When you start exploring other rooms, though, that\u0027s when everything becomes a little more, well, eerie.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s hard to tell from the street, but all those strip-club buildings on Bourbon Street are huge. I used to hate going to the upper floors and the smaller rooms in the back, because it gets spookily quiet. The hair on the back of your neck just stands up,\u0022 says Liam Deegan, a former bartender at the strip club Scores. \u000A\u000ADeegan, who now co-owns the popular bourbon bar Barrel Proof, has a particular story he can\u0027t shake.  A dancer at the club—who was known for her laid-back personality—came flying down a back staircase to the bar one night, panicked and out of breath. In an attempt to sneak past a VIP area for a smoke, she had taken a quasi-hidden, underused path out of her dressing room and passed a strange mirror along the way. When she glanced in, what she caught looking back wasn\u0027t her reflection, but a giant orb of light. The orb started moving, and chased her down the stairs like some sort of enraged spirit. \u0022I didn\u0027t go upstairs for a few weeks after that,\u0022 Deegan says.\u000A\u000AFor better or worse, many New Orleans strip clubs have a little something extra in store when you hit up a champagne room or sneak away for some private time—the promise of hauntings.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIt might seem odd, at first blush, that ghost stories and sex are sold in incredibly similar fashion in the French Quarter. Upon closer inspection, though, it becomes all too clear how the two are inextricably linked. There\u0027s an undeniable pull to people and places that are dangerous or forbidden, whether that manifests as a fascination with the undead or dating a guy with a motorcycle. What\u0027s more, the tethering of pleasure to pain in the human brain makes us animal-like in our response process, serving as the root of everything from BDSM arousal to the adrenaline rush of walking through a haunted house. \u000A\u000AThe tug-of-war between the bass-pumping, tasseled, gyrating allure of the strip club and the faux-gothic mystique of ghost tours has pushed and pulled in the French Quarter for decades, with the two competing for the almighty tourist dollar and—funny enough—turf. \u0022Ghost tours of the French Quarter became a phenomenon in the late 1990s, when Ann Rice\u0027s vampire novels were all the rage,\u0022 says Dr. Richard Campanella, author of Boubon Street: A History. \u0022On any given night today, you can see a dozen such tours milling around the lower Quarter telling their yarns. But they tend to stay away from the commercial end of Bourbon because its wholesale dedication to entertainment is incompatible with the shtick of the walking tours.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022People say that they can still see the daughter of the man who lived there before it was a brothel. They also say they can see the head servant—a bigger lady—and from time to time, a little girl.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000ALocated in the very heart of that neon-bright and beer-soaked stretch of Bourbon, Scores is the kind of strip club that somehow retains a charming, mom-and-pop feel. Harmless, potbellied men in sports-themed attire push past me onto the street, squinting like moles in the sunlight, and the lack of doorman at this strange midday hour feels like the ultimate welcome mat. \u000A\u000ASidling up to the bar on a warm Tuesday afternoon, I\u0027m curious just how close to popping bottles with ghosts I\u0027ll be able to get on my Ghostbusters-style strip-club crawl. \u000A\u000A\u0022One of the clubs I operate, Temptations, was maybe the first brothel in New Orleans back in the day,\u0022 says Chad Murray, Scores\u0027 manager, who has joined me as I sip Maker\u0027s. With his shaved head and two-sizes-too-small black T-shirt, Murray could easily win a Pitbull-look-a-like contest. \u0022People say that they can still see the daughter of the man who lived there before it was a brothel. They also say they can see the head servant—a bigger lady—and from time to time, a little girl.\u0022\u000A\u000AMost strip clubs don\u0027t publicize their supernatural sides, relying primarily on staff to keep the legends alive. A staggering percentage of entertainers in French Quarter strip clubs seem to believe ghost stories as gospel, and are more than willing to contribute their own \u0022close encounters\u0022 to the mix.\u000A\u000AWhen I surveyed my illustrious panel of strip-club experts (read: my friends) about ghoulish claims, they confirmed that Temptations often makes folks uneasy. \u0022Yeah, I went to Temptations for ‘research\u0027 purposes once and ended up paying more for an impromptu ghost tour [from an entertainer] than an actual dance,\u0022 my friend Andy recalled. \u0022Still sort of sexy and mysterious. Money well spent.\u0022 \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AScores is decked out in delicately arranged Halloween regalia that would put most haunted houses to shame. Moreover, the building has built-in, 300-year-old Victorian architectural drama—with even a fog machine blasting—that naturally oozes creep.\u000A\u000A\u0022Oh, yeah, I decorated all this myself. I decorate all my clubs,\u0022 Murray says proudly, waving his hand around at the fake spider webs that sprawl across the cobblestone arches and gilded ceilings. While we talk, I can\u0027t shake a vision of Casper the Friendly Ghost twerking in seven-inch platforms on the stage in front of us.\u000A\u000A\u0022Down the street you have the Hustle Club, and I used to run that one back in the day,\u0022 Murray says with a shiver. \u0022At night, when you\u0027re shutting down—and you\u0027re actually shutting down the club—that\u0027s when it gets to be super, super scary.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe pauses, lowering his voice and drawing in closer to me. \u000A\u000A\u0022The building that\u0027s really been a terror to go into, though, is The Penthouse Club on Iberville. You\u0027ll have to go there and figure that out for yourself,\u0022 Murray says, wincing. \u0022You have to go to the third floor, and if you can talk the manager into opening up the fourth floor—there you go. That\u0027s the scariest building I\u0027ve ever been into off of Bourbon.\u0022 \u000A\u000A\u0022I can\u0027t shake a vision of Casper the Friendly Ghost twerking in seven-inch platforms on the stage in front of us.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000ALater that evening, I sit at the Penthouse Club bar chatting with the fresh-on-the-scene floor manager, Wayne. Chad had described Wayne\u0027s look as \u0022one of those Twilight-looking werewolf guys,\u0022 but in reality he more closely resembles a well-coiffed used-car salesman. During his short time on the job, Wayne is sure he\u0027s already heard all possible rumors coming and going about the club.\u000A\u000A\u0022The biggest legend is that there\u0027s a ghost on the fourth floor. Back before we renovated the space, it was storage, and it was filthy dirty—a 200-year-old storage attic. Yet one of the windows looking out over the street was always clean from the inside. It was only clean where you would have to look out. If people put things in front of that spot, they\u0027d be moved when they came back upstairs. Rumor has it that it was ghosts from 100-plus years ago—who were murdered or something, who knows?—trying to look out and see what\u0027s going on in New Orleans.\u0022\u000A\u000AToday the space functions as a dressing room for entertainers, who remain leery of the fourth floor\u0027s paranormal activities.\u000A\u000A\u0022Ever since it has been the dressing room, [the window] has been the spot where nobody likes to stand or go. A lot of the girls will say, ‘Oh, I saw something!\u0027 but who knows if they\u0027re just trying to perpetuate it or not. It\u0027s just this one creepy little area of the window on the inside where no one likes to sit or do anything.\u0022 \u000A\u000AOf course, not everyone is so convinced. John Miller, The Penthouse Club\u0027s general manager, thinks the ghost stories across the board are a whole lot of hooey. \u0022We\u0027ve had people walk through and hold séances in the club, and say they feel things here and there,\u0022 Miller says. \u0022I don\u0027t buy it. You get people in a place, late night, drinking and already worked up. You tell them a bunch of stories, and obviously they\u0027ll believe them.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWant to get a human very excited, very fast? \u000A\u000AMake something taboo. \u000A\u000AThis is the central allure of both ghosts and peep shows for the millions of tourists who stumble their way through the French Quarter annually. \u000A\u000A\u0022Both strip clubs and ghosts play into doing the naughty thing. It\u0027s toeing that edge of the thing you\u0027re not supposed to do. It\u0027s arousing,\u0022 says Kenneth Castles, a ghost-tour guide-in-training. \u0022It\u0027s the selling of titillation for both—it\u0027s just where the excitement comes from that\u0027s different.\u0022\u000A\u000AAs we chat on the corner of Royal and Bourbon, I can\u0027t help but notice Castles\u0027 commitment to a distinctive personal brand. Hovering somewhere between Hot Topic employee and frontman for a Count Chocula–themed hair band, Castles\u0027 outfit consists of a hodgepodge of clunky silver rings, turquoise necklaces, and questionable tribal tattoos, which add a degree of flair to his otherwise pitch-black ensemble—a vest worn sans shirt and skinny jeans. \u000A\u000AIf they built a T.G.I. Friday\u0027s in hell, this would be the dress code. \u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s all so interconnected,\u0022 Castles muses, flipping his Rapunzel-length locks. \u0022Selling sex is appealing directly to the hindbrain, the groin, and the eyeball. Some ghostly things are eyeball-related…but a lot of ghost stories are more psychological.\u0022\u000A\u000ANew Orleans is a city where the line between playing pretend and real life is often blurred, with people committing so hard to a facade that sometimes it becomes impossible to remember what\u0027s genuine and what\u0027s for show. Still, most folks know that the stripper winking and flirting isn\u0027t really going to go home with them, and that the prickly-necked sensation one feels when walking into an old building is likely not an angry spirit. \u000A\u000AWhether or not it\u0027s all genuine, there\u0027s no better place in the world to suspend reality—if only for the length of a lap dance.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASarah Baird is a writer based in New Orleans.",

data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.0">On the first floor of most French Quarter strip clubs, the energy isn&#x2019;t that much different from other dens of sexy dancing scattered across America. There&#x2019;s the thump-thump of a club remix, criminally overpriced drinks, and&#x2014;of course&#x2014;half-naked women with names like Dynasty popping and locking with varying levels of enthusiasm. When you start exploring other rooms, though, that&apos;s when everything becomes a little more, well, <em>eerie</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.1">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s hard to tell from the street, but all those strip-club buildings on Bourbon Street are huge. I used to hate going to the upper floors and the smaller rooms in the back, because it gets spookily quiet. The hair on the back of your neck just stands up,&#x201D; says Liam Deegan, a former bartender at the strip club Scores. </p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.2">Deegan, who now co-owns the popular bourbon bar Barrel Proof, has a particular story he can&#x2019;t shake.  A dancer at the club&#x2014;who was known for her laid-back personality&#x2014;came flying down a back staircase to the bar one night, panicked and out of breath. In an attempt to sneak past a VIP area for a smoke, she had taken a quasi-hidden, underused path out of her dressing room and passed a strange mirror along the way. When she glanced in, what she caught looking back wasn&#x2019;t her reflection, but a giant orb of light. The orb started moving, and chased her down the stairs like some sort of enraged spirit. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t go upstairs for a few weeks after that,&#x201D; Deegan says.</p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.3">For better or worse, many New Orleans strip clubs have a little something extra in store when you hit up a champagne room or sneak away for some private time&#x2014;the promise of hauntings.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.5"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.6">It might seem odd, at first blush, that ghost stories and sex are sold in incredibly similar fashion in the French Quarter. Upon closer inspection, though, it becomes all too clear how the two are inextricably linked. There&#x2019;s an undeniable pull to people and places that are dangerous or forbidden, whether that manifests as a fascination with the undead or dating a guy with a motorcycle. What&#x2019;s more, the tethering of pleasure to pain in the human brain makes us animal-like in our response process, serving as the root of everything from BDSM arousal to the adrenaline rush of walking through a haunted house. </p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.7">The tug-of-war between the bass-pumping, tasseled, gyrating allure of the strip club and the faux-gothic mystique of ghost tours has pushed and pulled in the French Quarter for decades, with the two competing for the almighty tourist dollar and&#x2014;funny enough&#x2014;turf. &#x201C;Ghost tours of the French Quarter became a phenomenon in the late 1990s, when Ann Rice&#x2019;s vampire novels were all the rage,&#x201D; says Dr. Richard Campanella, author of <em>Boubon Street: A History</em>. &#x201C;On any given night today, you can see a dozen such tours milling around the lower Quarter telling their yarns. But they tend to stay away from the commercial end of Bourbon because its wholesale dedication to entertainment is incompatible with the shtick of the walking tours.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.8"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&quot;People say that they can still see the daughter of the man who lived there before it was a brothel.

Harmless, potbellied men in sports-themed attire push past me onto the street, squinting like moles in the sunlight, and the lack of doorman at this strange midday hour feels like the ultimate welcome mat. </p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.a">Sidling up to the bar on a warm Tuesday afternoon, I&#x2019;m curious just how close to popping bottles with ghosts I&#x2019;ll be able to get on my <em>Ghostbusters</em>-style strip-club crawl. </p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.b">&#x201C;One of the clubs I operate, Temptations, was maybe the first brothel in New Orleans back in the day,&#x201D; says Chad Murray, Scores&#x2019; manager, who has joined me as I sip Maker&#x2019;s. With his shaved head and two-sizes-too-small black T-shirt, Murray could easily win a Pitbull-look-a-like contest. &#x201C;People say that they can still see the daughter of the man who lived there before it was a brothel. They also say they can see the head servant&#x2014;a bigger lady&#x2014;and from time to time, a little girl.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.c">Most strip clubs don&#x2019;t publicize their supernatural sides, relying primarily on staff to keep the legends alive. A staggering percentage of entertainers in French Quarter strip clubs seem to believe ghost stories as gospel, and are more than willing to contribute their own &#x201C;close encounters&#x201D; to the mix.</p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.d">When I surveyed my illustrious panel of strip-club experts (read: my friends) about ghoulish claims, they confirmed that Temptations often makes folks uneasy. &#x201C;Yeah, I went to Temptations for &#x2018;research&#x2019; purposes once and ended up paying more for an impromptu ghost tour [from an entertainer] than an actual dance,&#x201D; my friend Andy recalled. &#x201C;Still sort of sexy and mysterious. Money well spent.&#x201D; </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.e"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/56328b0dacca7b7f780e5952/master/w_806/spooky-stripper.jpg" alt="spooky-stripper.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-haunted-strip-clubs-of-new-orleans&amp;t=spooky-stripper.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-haunted-strip-clubs-of-new-orleans&amp;t=spooky-stripper.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-haunted-strip-clubs-of-new-orleans&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F56328b0dacca7b7f780e5952%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fspooky-stripper.jpg&amp;description=spooky-stripper.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-haunted-strip-clubs-of-new-orleans&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F56328b0dacca7b7f780e5952%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fspooky-stripper.jpg&amp;description=spooky-stripper.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.f">Scores is decked out in delicately arranged Halloween regalia that would put most haunted houses to shame.

I decorate all my clubs,&#x201D; Murray says proudly, waving his hand around at the fake spider webs that sprawl across the cobblestone arches and gilded ceilings. While we talk, I can&apos;t shake a vision of Casper the Friendly Ghost twerking in seven-inch platforms on the stage in front of us.</p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.h">&#x201C;Down the street you have the Hustle Club, and I used to run that one back in the day,&#x201D; Murray says with a shiver. &#x201C;At night, when you&#x2019;re shutting down&#x2014;and you&#x2019;re actually shutting down the club&#x2014;that&#x2019;s when it gets to be super, super scary.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.i">He pauses, lowering his voice and drawing in closer to me. </p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.j">&#x201C;The building that&#x2019;s really been a terror to go into, though, is The Penthouse Club on Iberville. You&#x2019;ll have to go there and figure that out for yourself,&#x201D; Murray says, wincing. &#x201C;You have to go to the third floor, and if you can talk the manager into opening up the fourth floor&#x2014;there you go. That&#x2019;s the scariest building I&#x2019;ve ever been into off of Bourbon.&#x201D; </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.k"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&quot;I can&#x2019;t shake a vision of Casper the Friendly Ghost twerking in seven-inch platforms on the stage in front of us.&quot;</p></blockquote></span><div class="pullquote-share twitter"><a class="pullquote-share-icon" href="https://twitter.com/share?via=GQ&amp;text=%22%26quot%3BI%20can%E2%80%99t%20shake%20a%20vision%20of%20Casper%20the%20Friendly%20Ghost%20twerking%20in%20seven-inch%20platforms%20on%20the%20stage%20in%20front%20of%20us.%26quot%3B%22" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.l">Later that evening, I sit at the Penthouse Club bar chatting with the fresh-on-the-scene floor manager, Wayne. Chad had described Wayne&#x2019;s look as &#x201C;one of those <em>Twilight</em>-looking werewolf guys,&#x201D; but in reality he more closely resembles a well-coiffed used-car salesman. During his short time on the job, Wayne is sure he&#x2019;s already heard all possible rumors coming and going about the club.</p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.m">&#x201C;The biggest legend is that there&#x2019;s a ghost on the fourth floor. Back before we renovated the space, it was storage, and it was filthy dirty&#x2014;a 200-year-old storage attic. Yet one of the windows looking out over the street was always clean from the inside. It was only clean where you would have to look out. If people put things in front of that spot, they&#x2019;d be moved when they came back upstairs. Rumor has it that it was ghosts from 100-plus years ago&#x2014;who were murdered or something, who knows?&#x2014;trying to look out and see what&#x2019;s going on in New Orleans.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.n">Today the space functions as a dressing room for entertainers, who remain leery of the fourth floor&#x2019;s paranormal activities.</p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.o">&#x201C;Ever since it has been the dressing room, [the window] has been the spot where nobody likes to stand or go. A lot of the girls will say, &#x2018;Oh, I saw something!&#x2019; but who knows if they&#x2019;re just trying to perpetuate it or not. It&#x2019;s just this one creepy little area of the window on the inside where no one likes to sit or do anything.&#x201D; </p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.p">Of course, not everyone is so convinced. John Miller, The Penthouse Club&#x2019;s general manager, thinks the ghost stories across the board are a whole lot of hooey. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve had people walk through and hold s&#xE9;ances in the club, and say they feel things here and there,&#x201D; Miller says. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t buy it. You get people in a place, late night, drinking and already worked up. You tell them a bunch of stories, and obviously they&#x2019;ll believe them.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.q"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.r">Want to get a human very excited, very fast? </p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.s">Make something taboo. </p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.t">This is the central allure of both ghosts and peep shows for the millions of tourists who stumble their way through the French Quarter annually. </p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.u">&#x201C;Both strip clubs and ghosts play into doing the naughty thing. It&#x2019;s toeing that edge of the thing you&#x2019;re not supposed to do. It&#x2019;s arousing,&#x201D; says Kenneth Castles, a ghost-tour guide-in-training. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the selling of titillation for both&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just where the excitement comes from that&#x2019;s different.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.v">As we chat on the corner of Royal and Bourbon, I can&apos;t help but notice Castles&#x2019; commitment to a distinctive personal brand. Hovering somewhere between Hot Topic employee and frontman for a Count Chocula&#x2013;themed hair band, Castles&#x2019; outfit consists of a hodgepodge of clunky silver rings, turquoise necklaces, and questionable tribal tattoos, which add a degree of flair to his otherwise pitch-black ensemble&#x2014;a vest worn sans shirt and skinny jeans. </p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.w">If they built a T.G.I. Friday&#x2019;s in hell, this would be the dress code. </p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.x">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s all so interconnected,&#x201D; Castles muses, flipping his Rapunzel-length locks. &#x201C;Selling sex is appealing directly to the hindbrain, the groin, and the eyeball. Some ghostly things are eyeball-related&#x2026;but a lot of ghost stories are more psychological.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".pmpfyykkqo.1.1.0.0.4.y">New Orleans is a city where the line between playing pretend and real life is often blurred, with people committing so hard to a facade that sometimes it becomes impossible to remember what&#x2019;s genuine and what&#x2019;s for show. Still, most folks know that the stripper winking and flirting isn&#x2019;t really going to go home with them, and that the prickly-necked sensation one feels when walking into an old building is
