  	    "articleBody": "When you sit across from Cindy Crawford, it\u0027s sort of like sitting across from a hologram. The feeling is one of, Wait, I had this poster in my dorm room. Cool.\u000A\u000ABut she\u0027s real, and that realness has always been her great power. Ever since the early nineties, when she emerged as one of the original supermodels (along with Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, and Linda Evangelista), Crawford has been building a career that has endured now for twenty-five years.\u000A\u000AWe met at Asiate in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York. She was dressed in tight jeans and a leather motorcycle-style jacket with zippers that gleamed. She appears to have barely aged. The hair is still that same Cindy mane; the lips are those lips.\u000A\u000AShe had just come from an interview with Howard Stern, and expressed her disappointment—at his good behavior. \u0022I was all prepared for him to be filthy and ‘go there,\u0027 but he was nice. It kind of threw me off.\u0022\u000A\u000AMaybe you have that effect on guys? I suggest. Make them better?\u000A\u000AShe laughs. \u0022I don\u0027t know. I like Howard. I was all ready…\u0022\u000A\u000ACrawford, like most models, is taller than you think. I\u0027m six-three, and it feels like she\u0027s just about my height—and all of her height seems to be in her legs. As I walk into the restaurant beside her, her hips come up to my abdomen. We find a table near the window, and the waiter asks if we want bread.\u000A\u000A\u0022Not this week,\u0022 Crawford says. \u0022This week, bread is the devil. I have to get through this tour.\u0022 She\u0027s promoting her new book, Becoming, a retrospective not merely of her glossy, iconic photographs over the past thirty years, but of her life and what she has learned.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ACrawford, believe it or not, turns fifty next year. She\u0027s married to Rande Gerber, the nightlife entrepreneur, and is a mother of two teenagers, a son and a daughter. She was born in DeKalb, Illinois, a farming town thirty miles west of Chicago. She still has a whiff of the accent in her speech, saying bar as bahhrrrr. Her father was a machinist and her mother worked in a doctor\u0027s office. Her parents got married young (her mother was pregnant at sixteen), and when she was ten her baby brother died of leukemia. The family was middle-class Midwestern, and to make money she spent her summers working in the cornfields that surrounded the town (yes, guys, it is just as you picture it—she was wearing Daisy Dukes). Later she earned a full ride for academics to Northwestern University to study chemical engineering. She dropped out after her first semester, after she appeared in a bikini on the cover of the DeKalb Nite Weekly—a local newspaper—and her modeling career began to take off. She moved to New York, and the rest is Cindy, Inc.\u000A\u000AYears before the idea of \u0022branding\u0022 yourself and developing \u0022platforms\u0022 to share that brand became the clichés they are today, Cindy Crawford was a major brand with multiple platforms. She not only was a founding member of the \u0022supermodel\u0022 world; she was also the first model to use modeling to build a multi-prong business empire. She wasn\u0027t just walking the runway and doing magazine covers; she also made it big in TV, hosting House of Style on MTV; she created a fitness video; she published a calendar that sold bazillions of copies.\u000A\u000AWhat comes across in her new book is, in fact, how savvy she is. It might sound strange to say about a woman who started as \u0022just\u0022 a model, but here it is: Crawford\u0027s book has smart advice and valuable insights for anyone looking to make their way in a world where everyone is trying to stand out from the pack. One of my favorite moments: Crawford is in a business meeting, getting pitched an idea. Instead of thinking like so many men and trying to hit the ball out of the park, she asked the guys who were pitching her: \u0022What does a single look like?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s a smart way to look at business,\u0022 she tells me. \u0022I\u0027ve always thought about business that way. And I don\u0027t like to let someone down in business. So you need to know if you just get on base, is that a success? Will we all be happy with that? I like the analogy, because time is money for all of us. For every decision I make, it comes down to \u0027How much time am I going to have to spend on this, and what am I going to get back?\u0027 So I always think, Okay, what\u0027s the single? And is this too much work for just a single? And then I still want to know what the home run is, because of course I still want that.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat would you tell an MBA student who was doing a case study on you and your brand, I ask her. On how you built it and maintain it?\u000A\u000A\u0022I got lucky, kind of,\u0022 she says. \u0022I made some good decisions and did some of my own projects that helped me. If I had to describe my brand, I would say all-American, sexy girl next door. But maybe now I\u0027m the MILF next door. And I was accessible. Not elitist. I did Pepsi. Revlon. They were accessible. As I started making bigger decisions, it was about access. Even the book—I could have made it big and expensive. But that\u0027s not my audience. That\u0027s not me. I\u0027m Midwestern. I always think of my sisters—could they afford the book?\u0022\u000A\u000AIn a way, her accomplishments are all the more impressive when you consider that it all happened in a pre-digital, pre–social-media world.\u000A\u000AIf you were asked to advise the supermodels of today—Karlie Kloss or anyone else in Taylor Swift\u0027s \u0022Bad Blood\u0022 video—on how to build a brand, what would you tell them?\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m envious of the young models today that they have social media as another tool in their arsenals. My generation—how the world saw us is how the different photographers saw us. We weren\u0027t responsible for our output. If Mr. Penn shot you classical, that\u0027s what the world saw. And that was it. But I did House of Style, so I got to reveal a little bit of personality. But now, Cara Delevingne can look one way in pictures, but she can present another way, the way she wants to portray herself, through social media. That\u0027s a great advantage. And a great responsibility. And not everyone handles it with equal skill.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat advice would you give them for careers?\u000A\u000A\u0022One, it\u0027s a business. Understand that. All these people want to use you, and if you are smart, you learn how to use them back. It\u0027s commerce. And ideally, the two [sides] are in alignment. So you elevate each other. I look at jobs, and you have two bank accounts. One bank account is credibility, and the other is money. Over the years, I realized everyone has their own agenda. And I realized I am the number-one expert on Cindy Crawford. It was not till I was in my thirties that I felt that confidence. In the end, you are your brand expert.\u000A\u000A \u0022And this goes along with that: In my generation, agencies were not looking at you as a long-term investment. They saw you as a girl with a short career. I left my agency and went with a theatrical agency because they only took ten percent. Model agencies would take up to twenty percent, and then charge the client twenty percent on top. So I thought, if you are taking ten from me and twenty from the client, who do you really work for? In my late twenties, I made that change. Agents are great at making deals, but not building you. I wanted a business daddy. And I tried so many different business daddies on for size. In the end, I had to be my own business daddy.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestHerb Ritts\u000A\u000AWas there a moment when you knew you would run things for yourself?   \u000A\u000A\u0022I was sitting in a meeting with licensing guys, and I thought, I know more than them. I already know all this. So why would I pay them? I then took all my licensing in house…Models are like athletes. We have this in common: a sell-by date. Everyone is aware of it. So you want to make the most while you can, but also set yourself up for when you are not big. And you can channel it in other directions that are authentic to who you are. That\u0027s something I\u0027d tell a young girl. Make sure the \u0027role\u0027 fits you.\u0022\u000A\u000A And what about your daughter? What would you advise her?\u000A\u000A\u0022She wants to model. At fourteen. Here\u0027s the difference between the generations: I built my craft. I modeled for two years in Chicago before I came to NY. I had done Sears. I paid my dues. And then I came here, and I still paid dues with catalog work before I hit. And over that time you learn, so when your moment comes you are prepared. I would tell my daughter to slow down, enjoy it, make the relationships, do the work, and the right thing will come. I did not get into modeling to become famous. It was not like now. Fame is so different now. Fame used to be associated with a certain kind of success. Now fame is just fame. With no weight behind it.\u0022\u000A\u000AIn her book, Crawford talks about how she didn\u0027t live a crazy, dancing-on-tables model life. She\u0027s the opposite of Kate Moss. She tells me she\u0027s not sure if it was her Midwestern-ness, but she has always wanted to be professional and on time. \u0022I was always reading a book backstage. In some ways I missed out on things, and maybe I should have taken more chances, but I never wanted to put myself in a bad position. I said no too often…I would have said yes more.\u0022\u000A\u000AIs there a book you read back then that still means something to you?\u000A\u000A\u0022House of Mirth, by Edith Wharton. I wrote a paper in high school about it. It sticks with me. The idea that her goodness illuminated the ugliness in others, who were trying to destroy her and bring her down. I was just talking to my daughter because the mean-girl stuff has started. She\u0027s fourteen. She\u0027s conflicted and confused. I had to tell her that sometimes people try and bring people down to their level. So that\u0027s what I got from that book. To see that behavior, and be aware of it, and not do it yourself.\u0022",

The feeling is one of, <em>Wait, I had this poster in my dorm room. Cool</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.1">But she&apos;s real, and that realness has always been her great power. Ever since the early nineties, when she emerged as one of the original supermodels (along with Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, and Linda Evangelista), Crawford has been building a career that has endured now for twenty-five years.</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.2">We met at Asiate in the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York. She was dressed in tight jeans and a leather motorcycle-style jacket with zippers that gleamed. She appears to have barely aged. The hair is still that same Cindy mane; the lips are those lips.</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.3">She had just come from an interview with Howard Stern, and expressed her disappointment&#x2014;at his good behavior. &quot;I was all prepared for him to be filthy and &#x2018;go there,&#x2019; but he was nice. It kind of threw me off.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.5"><em>Maybe you have that effect on guys?</em> I suggest. <em>Make them better?</em></p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.6">She laughs. &quot;I don&apos;t know. I like Howard. I was all ready&#x2026;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.7">Crawford, like most models, is taller than you think. I&apos;m six-three, and it feels like she&apos;s just about my height&#x2014;and all of her height seems to be in her legs. As I walk into the restaurant beside her, her hips come up to my abdomen. We find a table near the window, and the waiter asks if we want bread.</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.8">&quot;Not this week,&quot; Crawford says. &quot;This week, bread is the devil. I have to get through this tour.&quot; She&apos;s promoting her new book, <em>Becoming,</em> a retrospective not merely of her glossy, iconic photographs over the past thirty years, but of her life and what she has learned.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.9"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/560eb0b2e8a83977119f2e77/master/w_806/cindy-crawford-book-cover.jpg" alt="cindy-crawford-book-cover.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcindy-crawford-model-interview&amp;t=cindy-crawford-book-cover.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcindy-crawford-model-interview&amp;t=cindy-crawford-book-cover.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcindy-crawford-model-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F560eb0b2e8a83977119f2e77%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fcindy-crawford-book-cover.jpg&amp;description=cindy-crawford-book-cover.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcindy-crawford-model-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F560eb0b2e8a83977119f2e77%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fcindy-crawford-book-cover.jpg&amp;description=cindy-crawford-book-cover.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.a">Crawford, believe it or not, turns fifty next year. She&apos;s married to Rande Gerber, the nightlife entrepreneur, and is a mother of two teenagers, a son and a daughter. She was born in DeKalb, Illinois, a farming town thirty miles west of Chicago. She still has a whiff of the accent in her speech, saying bar as <em>bahhrrrr</em>. Her father was a machinist and her mother worked in a doctor&apos;s office. Her parents got married young (her mother was pregnant at sixteen), and when she was ten her baby brother died of leukemia. The family was middle-class Midwestern, and to make money she spent her summers working in the cornfields that surrounded the town (yes, guys, it is just as you picture it&#x2014;she was wearing Daisy Dukes). Later she earned a full ride for academics to Northwestern University to study chemical engineering. She dropped out after her first semester, after she appeared in a bikini on the cover of the <em>DeKalb Nite Weekly</em>&#x2014;a local newspaper&#x2014;and her modeling career began to take off. She moved to New York, and the rest is Cindy, Inc.</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.b">Years before the idea of &quot;branding&quot; yourself and developing &quot;platforms&quot; to share that brand became the clich&#xE9;s they are today, Cindy Crawford was a major brand with multiple platforms. She not only was a founding member of the &quot;supermodel&quot; world; she was also the first model to use modeling to build a multi-prong business empire. She wasn&apos;t just walking the runway and doing magazine covers; she also made it big in TV, hosting <em>House of Style</em> on MTV; she created a fitness video; she published a calendar that sold bazillions of copies.</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.c">What comes across in her new book is, in fact, how savvy she is. It might sound strange to say about a woman who started as &quot;just&quot; a model, but here it is: Crawford&apos;s book has smart advice and valuable insights for anyone looking to make their way in a world where everyone is trying to stand out from the pack. One of my favorite moments: Crawford is in a business meeting, getting pitched an idea. Instead of thinking like so many men and trying to hit the ball out of the park, she asked the guys who were pitching her: &quot;What does a single look like?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.d">&quot;It&apos;s a smart way to look at business,&quot; she tells me. &quot;I&apos;ve always thought about business that way. And I don&apos;t like to let someone down in business. So you need to know if you just get on base, is that a success? Will we all be happy with that? I like the analogy, because time is money for all of us. For every decision I make, it comes down to &apos;How much time am I going to have to spend on this, and what am I going to get back?&apos; So I always think, <em>Okay, what&apos;s the single?</em> And is this too much work for just a single? And then I still want to know what the home run is, because of course I still want that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.e"><em>What would you tell an MBA student who was doing a case study on you and your brand,</em> I ask her. <em>On how you built it and maintain it?</em></p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.f">&quot;I got lucky, kind of,&quot; she says. &quot;I made some good decisions and did some of my own projects that helped me. If I had to describe my brand, I would say all-American, sexy girl next door. But maybe now I&apos;m the MILF next door. And I was accessible. Not elitist. I did Pepsi. Revlon. They were accessible. As I started making bigger decisions, it was about <em>access</em>. Even the book&#x2014;I could have made it big and expensive. But that&apos;s not my audience. That&apos;s not me. I&apos;m Midwestern. I always think of my sisters&#x2014;could they afford the book?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.g">In a way, her accomplishments are all the more impressive when you consider that it all happened in a pre-digital, pre&#x2013;social-media world.</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.h"><em>If you were asked to advise the supermodels of today&#x2014;Karlie Kloss or anyone else in Taylor Swift&apos;s &quot;Bad Blood&quot; video&#x2014;on how to build a brand, what would you tell them?</em></p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;I&apos;m envious of the young models today that they have social media as another tool in their arsenals. My generation&#x2014;how the world saw us is how the different photographers saw us. We weren&apos;t responsible for our output. If Mr. Penn shot you classical, that&apos;s what the world saw. And that was it. But I did <em>House of Style</em>, so I got to reveal a little bit of personality. But now, Cara Delevingne can look one way in pictures, but she can present another way, the way she wants to portray herself, through social media. That&apos;s a great advantage. And a great responsibility. And not everyone handles it with equal skill.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.j"><em>What advice would you give them for careers</em>?</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.k">&quot;One, it&apos;s a business. Understand that. All these people want to use you, and if you are smart, you learn how to use them back. It&apos;s commerce. And ideally, the two [sides] are in alignment. So you elevate each other. I look at jobs, and you have two bank accounts. One bank account is credibility, and the other is money. Over the years, I realized everyone has their own agenda. And I realized I am the number-one expert on Cindy Crawford. It was not till I was in my thirties that I felt that confidence. In the end, you are your brand expert.</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.l">&#x2028;&quot;And this goes along with that: In my generation, agencies were not looking at you as a long-term investment. They saw you as a girl with a short career. I left my agency and went with a theatrical agency because they only took ten percent. Model agencies would take up to twenty percent, and then charge the client twenty percent on top. So I thought, if you are taking ten from me and twenty from the client, who do you really work for? In my late twenties, I made that change. Agents are great at making deals, but not building you. I wanted a business daddy. And I tried so many different business daddies on for size. In the end, I had to be my own business daddy.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.m"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/560eb14c6349dcfa15f221a1/master/w_806/cindy-crawford-bw-02.jpg" alt="cindy-crawford-bw-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcindy-crawford-model-interview&amp;t=cindy-crawford-bw-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcindy-crawford-model-interview&amp;t=cindy-crawford-bw-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcindy-crawford-model-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F560eb14c6349dcfa15f221a1%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fcindy-crawford-bw-02.jpg&amp;description=cindy-crawford-bw-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fcindy-crawford-model-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F560eb14c6349dcfa15f221a1%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fcindy-crawford-bw-02.jpg&amp;description=cindy-crawford-bw-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Herb Ritts</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.n"><em>Was there a moment when you knew you would run things for yourself?</em>&#x2028;  </p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.o">&quot;I was sitting in a meeting with licensing guys, and I thought, <em>I know more than them. I already know all this. So why would I pay them?</em> I then took all my licensing in house&#x2026;Models are like athletes. We have this in common: a sell-by date. Everyone is aware of it. So you want to make the most while you can, but also set yourself up for when you are not big. And you can channel it in other directions that are authentic to who you are. That&apos;s something I&apos;d tell a young girl. Make sure the &apos;role&apos; fits you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.p">&#x2028;<em>And what about your daughter? What would you advise her?</em></p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.q">&quot;She wants to model. At fourteen. Here&apos;s the difference between the generations: I built my craft. I modeled for two years in Chicago before I came to NY. I had done Sears. I paid my dues. And then I came here, and I still paid dues with catalog work before I hit. And over that time you learn, so when your moment comes you are prepared. I would tell my daughter to slow down, enjoy it, make the relationships, do the work, and the right thing will come. I did not get into modeling to become famous. It was not like now. Fame is so different now. Fame used to be associated with a certain kind of success. Now fame is just fame. With no weight behind it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.r">In her book, Crawford talks about how she didn&apos;t live a crazy, dancing-on-tables model life. She&apos;s the opposite of Kate Moss. She tells me she&apos;s not sure if it was her Midwestern-ness, but she has always wanted to be professional and on time. &quot;I was always reading a book backstage. In some ways I missed out on things, and maybe I should have taken more chances, but I never wanted to put myself in a bad position. I said no too often&#x2026;I would have said yes more.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.s"><em>Is there a book you read back then that still means something to you?</em></p><p data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.4.t">&quot;<em>House of Mirth</em>, by Edith Wharton. I wrote a paper in high school about it. It sticks with me. The idea that her goodness illuminated the ugliness in others, who were trying to destroy her and bring her down. I was just talking to my daughter because the mean-girl stuff has started. She&apos;s fourteen. She&apos;s conflicted and confused. I had to tell her that sometimes people try and bring people down to their level. So that&apos;s what I got from that book. To see that behavior, and be aware of it, and not do it yourself.&quot;</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".w49bprbbwg.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div
