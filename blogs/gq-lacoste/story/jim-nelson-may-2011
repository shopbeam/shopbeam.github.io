  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A To celebrate GQ\u0027s relaunch of our new, advanced, superfancy iPad app—guaranteed to solve your mobile reading needs, dazzle you with new levels of visual geegaw-itude, and crush human loneliness once and for all—I thought I\u0027d tell you a story about my recently being assaulted by Nicolas Cage. There really is no connection here between the iPad and Cage except that both are looking thinner these days. But maybe when Sir Nicolas reads this, he\u0027ll feel a sense of remorse akin to a moral hangover and agree to do an exclusive GQ iPad video in which he apologizes to me and the roomful of New Orleans diners whose gourmet meals he drunkenly interrupted.\u000A\u000A I was down there for Mardi Gras; Cage was probably down there to buy human skulls. I arrived early for my dinner at Stella! (an excellent restaurant whose only crime against taste is that exclamation point), so I decided to wait for my friends at the fine bar. There were four stools, three of them occupied: by a fortyish couple and a man in a Mardi Gras mask who was buying them flamboyant beverages. The man sounded an awful lot like Milton from Drive Angry 3D. He wore rings the size of iguana heads. I took a seat at the bar, and when I looked over again, I saw Cage, unmasked.\u000A\u000A The woman was showing Cage cell-phone pics of the couple\u0027s adorable Latino-American kids. They must have been cute, because it drove him to melodramatic heights. \u0022Now, that\u0027s AMERICA!\u0022 he declared, pounding the bar. More drinks!\u000A\u000A He wanted to be friends forever. \u0022Gimme your card. I want your card!\u0022 said Cage to the husband. The guy didn\u0027t have a card to give.\u000A\u000A \u0022How do I get in contact with you?\u0022 Cage nearly screamed. \u0022GIVE ME YOUR DIGITS!!!\u0022\u000A\u000A Someone from the restaurant later explained to me that Cage had had \u0022an altercation\u0022 with his wife and 5-year-old son earlier that evening in the dining room.&amp;sup1; They\u0027d stormed out. He stayed and continued to let les bons temps rouler.\u000A\u000A Now a nervous waiter appeared, cradling rare wines, and presented Cage with two sick picks, an \u002782 Mouton Rothschild and a \u002759 Château Latour—an alcoholic Sophie\u0027s Choice if there ever was one. Cage leaned into the bottles, sniffed their labels. \u0022Okayokayokay how much?\u0022 I was trying not to listen (not really), but the answer Botod my face into full-on sticker shock: $3,500 for the Mouton, $6,000 for the, er, pricey one.&amp;sup2;\u000A\u000A Even this was too profligate for the mad spender who, before his financial meltdown, owned fifteen houses (two of which were in New Orleans and recently foreclosed), twenty-two cars, a Gulfstream jet, an island in the Bahamas, and apparently a Liberace lifetime of finger-jewelry.\u000A\u000A \u0022Now, come on!\u0022 he shouted at the waiter, waving the bottles away and pounding the bar again. \u0022Give me something more RRRRREAL!\u0022\u000A\u000A My guests, Karen and Marie, arrived, and we were taken gingerly past this scene to our table. But we were seated within wine-spitting distance of the bar and could still see Cage literally bouncing off the walls, spilling vino down his sleeve, as if he were performing Leaving Las Vegas: The Musical for some perverse dinner theater.\u000A\u000A Two cute women from the dining room went to scope out the commotion. Cage bought them both drinks. They skittered back to their meals. The couple Cage had befriended soon left, backing out the door and waving. They\u0027d seemed to have had enough. Bye-bye, crazy man who now has my digits.\u000A\u000A Our appetizers arrived like an elite rescue operation, and we dug into dishes of nouveau Louisiana. Sweet relief! That\u0027s when His Shadow appeared.\u000A\u000A He stood at the entrance of the room, clutching the hostess stand for balance, and glared out at the diners. The entire place went stone silent. He moved, stumbled, came closer to our tables.\u000A\u000A \u0022Where\u0027s the REAL girls?\u0022 he moaned.\u000A\u000A Huh? A few more paces. He\u0027s a foot away from my andouille sausage. Quick. Someone feed him.\u000A\u000A \u0022WHERE\u0027S THE REAL GIRLS?\u0022\u000A\u000A He spotted them in the corner, and moved toward them like a drugged Sasquatch. The room seemed to sway like an uncertain boat. The two ladies, alas, had manly company at the table. This did not dissuade Cage.\u000A\u000A \u0022You.\u0022 He pointed at the brunette. \u0022You\u0027re a contender.\u0022 He turned to the blonde. \u0022You\u0027re not.\u0022\u000A\u000A He was soon escorted out of the restaurant by a couple armfuls of hospitality. A manager type stood in the driveway outside and tried to gently scoot him off, the way you might shoo a raccoon you\u0027re not sure is feral. Nearby you could hear the carnival howls of Mardi Gras. The room sighed, slowly went back to digesting.\u000A\u000A Then we heard another tussle. Cage was at the doorway, trying to get past the manager dude, grabbing onto the walls, his arms extended out as if he were desperate to catch an existential football. His hand went through a panel in the door, shattering the glass. \u0022You LOVE ME!\u0022 he shouted to the restaurant staff, who surely at one point did.\u000A\u000A Cops were called. In New Orleans that usually means nothing happens. But they turned up—for a drunk-and-disorderly at Mardi Gras, no less. He was taken home, not arrested. But he suffered, I imagine, a head-cracking case of morning shame.\u000A\u000A That\u0027s my story, which I lived to tell. I\u0027m hoping Cage will do a dramatic reading of it for next month\u0027s iPad app.\u000A\u000A Jim Nelson editor-in-chief\u000A\u000A 1. How exactly one has an altercation with a 5-year-old remains unclear, even if the kid, Kal-el, is named after the origin-character in Superman.\u000A\u000A2. Dear Saturday Night Live: Isn\u0027t it time for \u0022Nicolas Cage: Sommelier\u0022? I\u0027d watch that every night.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Update (04-18-2011):  Just a few days after we posted about our editor\u0027s exciting run-in with national treasure Nicolas Cage at Stella! in New Orleans, the actor was arrested on a street corner in the French Quarter. (According to TMZ.com, Cage yelled, \u0022Why don\u0027t you just arrest me?\u0022 The police obliged. You see, he still has some of that Oscar-winning gravitas!) Just today we received yet another juicy update, this one from a woman who actually appears in our story: the brunette \u0022contender.\u0022 Quick highlight: \u0022Be my new mother\u0022 is in the arsenal of Cagian pick-up lines. (If this night becomes fodder for Cage\u0027s next movie we\u0027d like to suggest the title Drink Angry 3D.) The brunette contender, a.k.a Erin\u0027s full dispatch:\u000A\u000A My boyfriend, his brother and sister, and I had reservations at Stella! at 8:15 for dinner. We had gone to Napoleon House beforehand for a drink and arrived at the restaurant at 7:45. We were seated immediately in the dining room, which was rather full, at a table against the front wall. Allison and I sat near the wall, facing into the room, and Zach and Kellen sat across from us, facing us. I didn\u0027t notice anything particularly unusual but thought that it was odd that the couple across from us had a small child. Allison looked closer and noticed that that couple was Nicolas Cage and his wife, sitting roughly 15 feet from the table directly across from us. They appeared to be about to have the second course of their meal and had two bottles of wine at the table, though they were not drinking noticeably. They seemed to be having an intense conversation and Cage, who was sitting on the left side of the table, frequently stared at the large black and red rings he was wearing on his right hand. He was also wearing a gold watch on his right hand. His hair didn\u0027t look great but wasn\u0027t too disheveled at this point. I also noticed him looking over at our table, though at the time I thought that was my imagination (I don\u0027t have very good eyes so this would be kind of hard for me to tell anyway). The little boy was dressed casually and was playing a videogame throughout dinner and would crawl around the table, playing with the candleholder on the table, and pouring water into wine glasses. His parents paid him little attention. The table next to Cage bought him a glass of wine, but Cage ignored it. We were served our main course and at that time Cage and his family got up to leave. As they got up a man seated at the other table next to him greeted them and shook Cage\u0027s hand. We continued our meal and finished our main course. After the main course, Allison and I went to the ladies room, which was attached to the restaurant\u0027s bar and outside of the dining room. We went into the bathroom and Allison said, \u0022Nicolas Cage just checked you out!!\u0022 I hadn\u0027t noticed him but he was now sitting at the bar by himself drinking a glass of wine, apparently having sent his wife and son home without him. Allison and I went back to our table in the dining room and convinced Zach and Kellen to let us go to the bar to see what would happen and if he would talk with us, since he was alone. We went to the bar and I sat next to Cage and Allison sat next to me. Cage was sort of out of it and was talking to the manager when we sat down, trying to get him to sit and have a drink with him. He then said that the manager should sit down and have a drink with him and these lovely ladies. The manager said he had to get back to work, but thanked Cage and left. Cage then turned to us and acted befuddled, but friendly and offered us drinks. We were prepared to buy our own drinks and possibly have a nice platonic conversation with him. We did not intend to flirt (his wife had just left), but thought that we would see if he would talk to us or be congenial. After he got us our drinks I tried to introduce myself but he kept interrupting, apparently dismissing formalities. He said I looked incredible and asked if I was Jewish and said that he likes Jewish girls, and told me to say I was Jewish. I said I was not Jewish and we tried again to steer the conversation toward neutral topics like where we were from, what was he doing in town, what he was doing for Mardi Gras, if he\u0027s staying around here, etc. Allison was at the end of the table and it was difficult for her to hear Cage but he interrupted us and said \u0022I\u0027m sorry, but this has to be said: you\u0027re a contender, you\u0027re not a contender,\u0022 referring to me as a contender and Allison as the \u0022not contender.\u0022 Allison couldn\u0027t hear him and he said it again and then I told her what he had said. Once she heard what he said, she got up said \u0022You\u0027re not a contender either\u0022 and stormed back into the dining room. Not sure what to do, I stayed put and told him what a very rude thing that was to say. He agreed with me and said he shouldn\u0027t have said that. He asked me if I was \u0022remotely attracted\u0022 to him and I just said \u0022uh.\u0022 He then said that I was beautiful and that he loved me, which he quickly qualified by saying he loved my face. I was really nervous because he was looking pretty disheveled at this point and nobody was around. His hair was kind of wild, he was hunched at the bar, his face looked haggard, and he was pretty gaunt. I noticed that his legs looked bony in his slacks and he easy looked 10 years older than his age. He continued on by asking me to be his new mother and his new love, and I responded by saying, no, he already has a wife. He said his wife didn\u0027t love him and was gone. I was very nervous at this point but fortunately, Kellen came to the bar and said, \u0022Erin, dessert is about to be served and we would love for you to join us back at the table.\u0022 Cage stopped Kellen and said we were having a drink, Kellen said, \u0022No Nic, we\u0027re going back to the table.\u0022 Cage then said to Kellen, \u0022Do you love her? Because if you don\u0027t, I\u0027ll kick your ass!\u0022 Kellen said, \u0022Yes, I love her. I live with her.\u0022 Then Cage said, \u0022Does she love you?\u0022 I said yes and got up, hurriedly thanked him for the drink and we walked back to the table. I was really shaken up at this point. We walked back into the dining room and I was shaking. Back at the dinner table we were all relieved that was over and shocked it had gone South so fast because he had seemed relatively normal at dinner.  Zach remarked that he was not impressed with Cage because all he does are terrible movies and that moment, Cage stormed from the bar to our table. He came over to me and said, \u0022Let\u0027s go. Come on, let\u0027s go.\u0022 We were in the middle of the dining room and everyone could see this. I got up, sort of put my hands up defensively, and said to him in a lowered voice as to not make a scene, \u0022No, I\u0027m staying here and you\u0027re going home. You need to go home.\u0022 Cage wasn\u0027t taking no for an answer and Zach called our waiter asking if they could get rid of him. Zach then said to him \u0022I don\u0027t care who you are, get out of here.\u0022 The waiter and manager managed to get him away from our table and I sat back down. There was an altercation with Cage and the manager in the middle of the room and Cage shouted, \u0022She\u0027s coming home with me!\u0022 They pulled him out of the dining room and made him leave the restaurant. Immediately all the waiters locked all of the doors and windows in the dining room and shut the curtains. Cage was pounding on the front door, trying to open it and eventually punched a hole in the glass window of the door. A waiter came to the table a little later and he said that Cage doesn\u0027t come there often but that 30 New Orleans police officers had been called to take Cage home to his hotel. Then the manager came up and asked if we were ok. After we\u0027d paid our check we left the restaurant but had to exit out of the back door because the front door was being boarded up with cardboard. All of the police were gone and we noticed a black limousine outside the restaurant when we left, but no one was inside.",

<em>GQ&apos;</em>s relaunch of our new, advanced, superfancy iPad app&#x2014;guaranteed to solve your mobile reading needs, dazzle you with new levels of visual geegaw-itude, and crush human loneliness once and for all&#x2014;I thought I&apos;d tell you a story about my recently being assaulted by Nicolas Cage. There really is no connection here between the iPad and Cage except that both are looking thinner these days. But maybe when Sir Nicolas reads this, he&apos;ll feel a sense of remorse akin to a moral hangover and agree to do an exclusive <em>GQ</em> iPad video in which he apologizes to me and the roomful of New Orleans diners whose gourmet meals he drunkenly interrupted.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.2"> I was down there for Mardi Gras; Cage was probably down there to buy human skulls. I arrived early for my dinner at Stella! (an excellent restaurant whose only crime against taste is that exclamation point), so I decided to wait for my friends at the fine bar. There were four stools, three of them occupied: by a fortyish couple and a man in a Mardi Gras mask who was buying them flamboyant beverages. The man sounded an awful lot like Milton from <em>Drive Angry 3D</em>. He wore rings the size of iguana heads. I took a seat at the bar, and when I looked over again, I saw Cage, unmasked.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.3"> The woman was showing Cage cell-phone pics of the couple&apos;s adorable Latino-American kids. They must have been cute, because it drove him to melodramatic heights. &quot;Now, <em>that&apos;s</em> AMERICA!&quot; he declared, pounding the bar. More drinks!</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.5"> He wanted to be friends forever. &quot;Gimme your card. I want your card!&quot; said Cage to the husband. The guy didn&apos;t have a card to give.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.6"> &quot;How do I get in contact with you?&quot; Cage nearly screamed. &quot;GIVE ME YOUR DIGITS!!!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.7"> Someone from the restaurant later explained to me that Cage had had &quot;an altercation&quot; with his wife and 5-year-old son earlier that evening in the dining room.&amp;sup1; They&apos;d stormed out. He stayed and continued to let <em>les bons temps rouler</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.8"> Now a nervous waiter appeared, cradling rare wines, and presented Cage with two sick picks, an &apos;82 Mouton Rothschild and a &apos;59 Ch&#xE2;teau Latour&#x2014;an alcoholic Sophie&apos;s Choice if there ever was one. Cage leaned into the bottles, sniffed their labels. &quot;Okayokayokay how much?&quot; I was trying not to listen (not really), but the answer Botod my face into full-on sticker shock: $3,500 for the Mouton, $6,000 for the, er, pricey one.&amp;sup2;</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.9"> Even this was too profligate for the mad spender who, before his financial meltdown, owned fifteen houses (two of which were in New Orleans and recently foreclosed), twenty-two cars, a Gulfstream jet, an island in the Bahamas, and apparently a Liberace lifetime of finger-jewelry.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.a"> &quot;Now, come on!&quot; he shouted at the waiter, waving the bottles away and pounding the bar again. &quot;Give me something more RRRRREAL!&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.b"> My guests, Karen and Marie, arrived, and we were taken gingerly past this scene to our table. But we were seated within wine-spitting distance of the bar and could still see Cage literally bouncing off the walls, spilling vino down his sleeve, as if he were performing <em>Leaving Las Vegas: The Musical</em> for some perverse dinner theater.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Two cute women from the dining room went to scope out the commotion. Cage bought them both drinks. They skittered back to their meals. The couple Cage had befriended soon left, backing out the door and waving. They&apos;d seemed to have had enough. Bye-bye, crazy man who now has my digits.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Our appetizers arrived like an elite rescue operation, and we dug into dishes of nouveau Louisiana. Sweet relief! That&apos;s when His Shadow appeared.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.e"> He stood at the entrance of the room, clutching the hostess stand for balance, and glared out at the diners. The entire place went stone silent. He moved, stumbled, came closer to our tables.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.f"> &quot;Where&apos;s the REAL girls?&quot; he moaned.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.g"> Huh? A few more paces. He&apos;s a foot away from my andouille sausage. Quick. Someone feed him.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.h"> &quot;WHERE&apos;S THE REAL GIRLS?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.i"> He spotted them in the corner, and moved toward them like a drugged Sasquatch. The room seemed to sway like an uncertain boat. The two ladies, alas, had manly company at the table. This did not dissuade Cage.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.j"> &quot;You.&quot; He pointed at the brunette. &quot;You&apos;re a contender.&quot; He turned to the blonde. &quot;You&apos;re not.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.k"> He was soon escorted out of the restaurant by a couple armfuls of hospitality. A manager type stood in the driveway outside and tried to gently scoot him off, the way you might shoo a raccoon you&apos;re not sure is feral. Nearby you could hear the carnival howls of Mardi Gras. The room sighed, slowly went back to digesting.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.l"> Then we heard another tussle. Cage was at the doorway, trying to get past the manager dude, grabbing onto the walls, his arms extended out as if he were desperate to catch an existential football. His hand went through a panel in the door, shattering the glass. &quot;You LOVE ME!&quot; he shouted to the restaurant staff, who surely at one point did.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.m"> Cops were called. In New Orleans that usually means nothing happens. But they turned up&#x2014;for a drunk-and-disorderly at Mardi Gras, no less. He was taken home, not arrested. But he suffered, I imagine, a head-cracking case of morning shame.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.n"> That&apos;s my story, which I lived to tell. I&apos;m hoping Cage will do a dramatic reading of it for next month&apos;s iPad app.</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.o"> Jim Nelson editor-in-chief</p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.p"><em> 1.

(According to TMZ.com, Cage yelled, &quot;Why don&apos;t you just arrest me?&quot; The police obliged. You see, he still has some of that Oscar-winning gravitas!) Just today we received yet another juicy update, this one from a woman who actually appears in our story: the brunette &quot;contender.&quot; Quick highlight: &quot;Be my new mother&quot; is in the arsenal of Cagian pick-up lines. (If this night becomes fodder for Cage&apos;s next movie we&apos;d like to suggest the title </em>Drink Angry 3D<em>.) The brunette contender, a.k.a Erin&apos;s full dispatch:</em></p><p data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.4.t"> My boyfriend, his brother and sister, and I had reservations at Stella! at 8:15 for dinner. We had gone to Napoleon House beforehand for a drink and arrived at the restaurant at 7:45. We were seated immediately in the dining room, which was rather full, at a table against the front wall. Allison and I sat near the wall, facing into the room, and Zach and Kellen sat across from us, facing us. I didn&apos;t notice anything particularly unusual but thought that it was odd that the couple across from us had a small child. Allison looked closer and noticed that that couple was Nicolas Cage and his wife, sitting roughly 15 feet from the table directly across from us. They appeared to be about to have the second course of their meal and had two bottles of wine at the table, though they were not drinking noticeably. They seemed to be having an intense conversation and Cage, who was sitting on the left side of the table, frequently stared at the large black and red rings he was wearing on his right hand. He was also wearing a gold watch on his right hand. His hair didn&apos;t look great but wasn&apos;t too disheveled at this point. I also noticed him looking over at our table, though at the time I thought that was my imagination (I don&apos;t have very good eyes so this would be kind of hard for me to tell anyway). The little boy was dressed casually and was playing a videogame throughout dinner and would crawl around the table, playing with the candleholder on the table, and pouring water into wine glasses. His parents paid him little attention. The table next to Cage bought him a glass of wine, but Cage ignored it. We were served our main course and at that time Cage and his family got up to leave. As they got up a man seated at the other table next to him greeted them and shook Cage&apos;s hand. We continued our meal and finished our main course. After the main course, Allison and I went to the ladies room, which was attached to the restaurant&apos;s bar and outside of the dining room. We went into the bathroom and Allison said, &quot;Nicolas Cage just checked you out!!&quot; I hadn&apos;t noticed him but he was now sitting at the bar by himself drinking a glass of wine, apparently having sent his wife and son home without him. Allison and I went back to our table in the dining room and convinced Zach and Kellen to let us go to the bar to see what would happen and if he would talk with us, since he was alone. We went to the bar and I sat next to Cage and Allison sat next to me. Cage was sort of out of it and was talking to the manager when we sat down, trying to get him to sit and have a drink with him. He then said that the manager should sit down and have a drink with him and these lovely ladies. The manager said he had to get back to work, but thanked Cage and left. Cage then turned to us and acted befuddled, but friendly and offered us drinks. We were prepared to buy our own drinks and possibly have a nice platonic conversation with him. We did not intend to flirt (his wife had just left), but thought that we would see if he would talk to us or be congenial. After he got us our drinks I tried to introduce myself but he kept interrupting, apparently dismissing formalities. He said I looked incredible and asked if I was Jewish and said that he likes Jewish girls, and told me to say I was Jewish. I said I was not Jewish and we tried again to steer the conversation toward neutral topics like where we were from, what was he doing in town, what he was doing for Mardi Gras, if he&apos;s staying around here, etc. Allison was at the end of the table and it was difficult for her to hear Cage but he interrupted us and said &quot;I&apos;m sorry, but this has to be said: you&apos;re a contender, you&apos;re not a contender,&quot; referring to me as a contender and Allison as the &quot;not contender.&quot; Allison couldn&apos;t hear him and he said it again and then I told her what he had said. Once she heard what he said, she got up said &quot;You&apos;re not a contender either&quot; and stormed back into the dining room. Not sure what to do, I stayed put and told him what a very rude thing that was to say. He agreed with me and said he shouldn&apos;t have said that. He asked me if I was &quot;remotely attracted&quot; to him and I just said &quot;uh.&quot; He then said that I was beautiful and that he loved me, which he quickly qualified by saying he loved my face. I was really nervous because he was looking pretty disheveled at this point and nobody was around. His hair was kind of wild, he was hunched at the bar, his face looked haggard, and he was pretty gaunt. I noticed that his legs looked bony in his slacks and he easy looked 10 years older than his age. He continued on by asking me to be his new mother and his new love, and I responded by saying, no, he already has a wife. He said his wife didn&apos;t love him and was gone. I was very nervous at this point but fortunately, Kellen came to the bar and said, &quot;Erin, dessert is about to be served and we would love for you to join us back at the table.&quot; Cage stopped Kellen and said we were having a drink, Kellen said, &quot;No Nic, we&apos;re going back to the table.&quot; Cage then said to Kellen, &quot;Do you love her? Because if you don&apos;t, I&apos;ll kick your ass!&quot; Kellen said, &quot;Yes, I love her. I live with her.&quot; Then Cage said, &quot;Does she love you?&quot; I said yes and got up, hurriedly thanked him for the drink and we walked back to the table. I was really shaken up at this point. We walked back into the dining room and I was shaking. Back at the dinner table we were all relieved that was over and shocked it had gone South so fast because he had seemed relatively normal at dinner.  Zach remarked that he was not impressed with Cage because all he does are terrible movies and that moment, Cage stormed from the bar to our table. He came over to me and said, &quot;Let&apos;s go. Come on, let&apos;s go.&quot; We were in the middle of the dining room and everyone could see this. I got up, sort of put my hands up defensively, and said to him in a lowered voice as to not make a scene, &quot;No, I&apos;m staying here and you&apos;re going home. You need to go home.&quot; Cage wasn&apos;t taking no for an answer and Zach called our waiter asking if they could get rid of him. Zach then said to him &quot;I don&apos;t care who you are, get out of here.&quot; The waiter and manager managed to get him away from our table and I sat back down. There was an altercation with Cage and the manager in the middle of the room and Cage shouted, &quot;She&apos;s coming home with me!&quot; They pulled him out of the dining room and made him leave the restaurant. Immediately all the waiters locked all of the doors and windows in the dining room and shut the curtains. Cage was pounding on the front door, trying to open it and eventually punched a hole in the glass window of the door. A waiter came to the table a little later and he said that Cage doesn&apos;t come there often but that 30 New Orleans police officers had been called to take Cage home to his hotel. Then the manager came up and asked if we were ok. After we&apos;d paid our check we left the restaurant but had to exit out of the back door because the front door was being boarded up with cardboard. All of the police were gone and we noticed a black limousine outside the restaurant when we left, but no one was inside.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".lzrqze7kzk.1.1.0.0.5"><div
