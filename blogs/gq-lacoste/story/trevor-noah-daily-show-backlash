  	    "articleBody": "Do you feel the weight of increased scrutiny, now that you\u0027re taking over the Daily Show ?I feel like everything in my life has prepared me for this in a different way. I had a TV show back home; I did something similar. It was almost a fusion between a Daily Show and a Tonight Show. That\u0027s what I was doing back home, you know? On a smaller scale, yes, but I was involved in production; I was working through my show; I was writing scripts. I live in a country where I\u0027d say nine out of ten people know me when I walk through the streets. There\u0027s people taking pictures, there\u0027s tabloids trying to make up stories. I\u0027m used to that. The same thing when I\u0027m in Australia or the UK: I get stopped. Yes, it will be different because America\u0027s machine is so much bigger. But it\u0027s not zero to a hundred for me. It\u0027s like sixty to a hundred now.\u000A\u000AWhat about the experience of having America go back through your Twitter account and single out certain posts?Yeah, but that needed to happen. What happened there was perfect. Here\u0027s something you gotta understand: you can take any tweet and make it offensive. Any tweet. Here\u0027s a thing that people don\u0027t get: people had already vetted my tweets. People had read through my stuff. I had two million followers at that point. So even if we remove fake accounts and non-active accounts and all of those numbers, let\u0027s work on a safe number and say there\u0027s a million active people, alright? There were a million people vetting my account every single day. There\u0027s a million people who\u0027ve been reading my tweets every single day. Do you really think I snuck through the cracks as an anti-Semitic, sexist, misogynistic racist? You\u0027re insulting every single one of those people for, what? Just missing it? The funniest thing to me was when there was the Jewish council of South Africa, they wrote a long letter, and they were like, \u0022We know Trevor Noah. We know his comedy. He\u0027s the furthest thing from an anti-Semite.\u0022 They were like, \u0022This guy makes jokes about everything, and some of these things weren\u0027t even jokes; they were just random stuff.\u0022 And then what did people say? Instead of going, \u0022Oh, maybe you guys know him better,\u0022 they said, \u0022Oh, such a pity, these Jews in South Africa, they even hate themselves.\u0022 And then you realize, if people want to be angry, you can\u0027t stop them from being angry. You just have to let them be angry.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027d you think about what Stewart said about it?It was great. The truth is, people don\u0027t know me. When people don\u0027t know you, they\u0027re going to try to get to know you as quickly as possible, because you\u0027re now taking the place of somebody that they love dearly, or somebody that they hate sincerely, and so they need to know who you are. When you have a limited amount of time in the news cycle to discover who somebody is, you don\u0027t have time to watch their comedy specials. You don\u0027t have time to spend an hour. You need to get your article out as quickly as possible. How do you do that? You read a few tweets. There\u0027s nine thousand; \u0022I\u0027m just gonna type a few keywords in and see what his views are on certain things. That is my definition of him, done.\u0022 Because, ironically, if you look at it, you go, \u0022OK, he wrote a tweet about Israel fighting a lot. Is this something we don\u0027t know now, all of a sudden?\u0022 Israel and Palestine, they\u0027ve been fighting since the Bible. I don\u0027t understand why that makes me anti-Semitic for commenting on that. In that same logic, in that same tweet, I said, \u0022South Africa\u0027s bad at recycling.\u0022 Does that mean I hate South Africa now? Am I anti-South African? No. A joke doesn\u0027t mean that. Do you get what I\u0027m saying?\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re saying every joke needs to be understood in context — and as being said by you and not another person.Yes. That\u0027s very true. And this is another thing, my people understood it—and when I say \u0022my people,\u0022 I don\u0027t mean South Africans, \u0027cause I had followers from the U.S., I had followers from the U.K. My people were with me on the journey, you know? So yeah, there are some tweets that are like, \u0022What the hell, Trevor? That was shit. What was that?\u0022 And then you go, \u0022Sorry, guys, sorry. I was a little tired when I wrote that.\u0022 Or, \u0022I didn\u0027t think that through. Let me try it again.\u0022 I\u0027ve done that before with tweets, where I\u0027ll go, \u0022Wait, let me rewrite that joke. OK, wait, wait, wait, one more time.\u0022 And then people will be shitting on me, going, \u0022You\u0027re horrible.\u0022 And we joke about it, \u0027cause people know me. They\u0027re like, \u0022Dude,\u0022 you know? But I always tell people, I\u0027m like, \u0022Look, man. I\u0027m not a Twitter comedian. I\u0027m a comedian. This is a tool that I use to communicate with you and have fun and engage you in a conversation. If you wanna talk to me, you can meet me on Twitter. And if you really want to have a genuine discussion about anything, if you wanna just say, \u0027Hey, Trevor, how are you? Happy Birthday,\u0027 anything.\u0022 That\u0027s what Twitter\u0027s for. It\u0027s broken down barriers. So if you\u0027ve been with me on that journey, you know a bit more about who I am. So for instance, there\u0027s one tweet—and this is what made me so angry, is that it\u0027s one thing if you say a joke is bad or something on Twitter, but I hate it when people take a thing that\u0027s not a joke and now try and make it, like—they were like, \u0022Oh, he had a joke where he said he bumped a Jewish kid with his German car.\u0022 I\u0027m like, \u0022No. I was driving, ironically, to pick my mother up from shul. In the parking lot, a little Jewish kid ran across the road. So I stopped—like, I almost run this kid over. And I say to my brother, I\u0027m like, \u0027Can you imagine? Knocking down a little Jewish kid outside the shul? I\u0027m gonna be the guy that ran him over.\u0027 And my brother says, \u0027And you drive a German car.\u0027 And I\u0027m like, \u0027Oh, crap.\u0027\u0022\u000A\u000AWhy was your mom at shul?Because my mom converted to Judaism. So I\u0027m having this conversation the way you would on Snapchat or the way you would just telling my friends, \u0022This happened to me today.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u0022We had a funny conversation in the car.\u0022\u0022Here\u0027s a little piece of it.\u0022 And if you know me—and one of my friends was even like, \u0022How do you know the kid was Jewish?\u0022 And I was like, \u0022Because—\u0022 And then I joked—I was like, \u0022Because he looked Jewish. And because his parents looked Jewish. Oh, and because he was at shul.\u0022 You know, I was playing, and this is now a conversation with my friend. I remember, there was one tweet they found; it was a joke that I had with a girlfriend of mine at the time. And they were like, \u0022Oh, Trevor, he fat-shames women, and he\u0027s misogynistic.\u0022 No. That day, my girlfriend said to me, \u0022Man, I\u0027m getting so fat.\u0022 And I was like, \u0022We\u0027re both fat right now. We\u0027ve really gotten fat.\u0022 I was like, \u0022Clearly, we\u0027re extremely happy.\u0022 And then she wrote on Twitter—she was at work, and she wrote, \u0022When a woman is loved, she becomes ten times the woman that she is.\u0022 And I wrote, \u0022So she becomes fat? Is that what you\u0027re saying?\u0022 And that was our joke, between the two of us. People now are like, \u0022He shames his followers on Twitter. He trolls them.\u0022 I\u0027m like, \u0022No. This is somebody that I loved that I was engaging with. You just walked into a conversation.\u0022\u000A\u000AIs the conclusion going forward that you need to take the inside jokes off Twitter?No, no, no. Now I give people the chance to get to know me. You\u0027ve had your chance to be angry. Fine. You know, I\u0027ll let you be angry; I have no control over that. And I understand why you would do it. It\u0027s the same thing that happened to Justine Sacco on Twitter. It\u0027s happened to people; I\u0027ve seen that Twitter outrage thing before. I\u0027ve seen people lose their jobs over it. People love full outrage. You get to be a protestor in your underwear. You don\u0027t have to leave your house.\u000A\u000AAnd that\u0027s the world we live in now. There\u0027s more outrage on Twitter about a One Direction split or about what one band member said to another than there is about institutionalized racism and something huge. We get angry about the small things, sometimes I feel, so that we feel like we\u0027re doing something, so that we don\u0027t have to tackle the big things. And it\u0027s fine; let people do that. But I\u0027m not gonna now change because of that. You know? Like, the worst thing that happens to me is you don\u0027t like me. And then what?",

I had a TV show back home; I did something similar. It was almost a fusion between a <em>Daily Show</em> and a <em>Tonight Show</em>. That&apos;s what I was doing back home, you know? On a smaller scale, yes, but I was involved in production; I was working through my show; I was writing scripts. I live in a country where I&apos;d say nine out of ten people know me when I walk through the streets. There&apos;s people taking pictures, there&apos;s tabloids trying to make up stories. I&apos;m used to that. The same thing when I&apos;m in Australia or the UK: I get stopped. Yes, it will be different because America&apos;s machine is so much bigger. But it&apos;s not zero to a hundred for me. It&apos;s like sixty to a hundred now.</p><p data-reactid=".1kb7rwf7wn4.1.1.0.0.4.1"><strong>What about the experience of having America go back through your Twitter account and single out certain posts?</strong><br>Yeah, but that needed to happen. What happened there was perfect. Here&apos;s something you gotta understand: you can take any tweet and make it offensive. Any tweet. Here&apos;s a thing that people don&apos;t get: people had already vetted my tweets. People had read through my stuff. I had two million followers at that point. So even if we remove fake accounts and non-active accounts and all of those numbers, let&apos;s work on a safe number and say there&apos;s a million active people, alright? There were a million people vetting my account every single day. There&apos;s a million people who&apos;ve been reading my tweets every single day. Do you really think I snuck through the cracks as an anti-Semitic, sexist, misogynistic racist? You&apos;re insulting every single one of those people for, what? Just missing it? The funniest thing to me was when there was the Jewish council of South Africa, they wrote a long letter, and they were like, &quot;We know Trevor Noah. We know his comedy. He&apos;s the furthest thing from an anti-Semite.&quot; They were like, &quot;This guy makes jokes about everything, and some of these things weren&apos;t even jokes; they were just random stuff.&quot; And then what did people say? Instead of going, &quot;Oh, maybe you guys know him better,&quot; they said, &quot;Oh, such a pity, these Jews in South Africa, they even hate themselves.&quot; And then you realize, if people want to be angry, you can&apos;t stop them from being angry. You just have to let them be angry.</p><p data-reactid=".1kb7rwf7wn4.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>What&apos;d you think about what <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/on-the-daily-show-jon-stewart-offers-support-to-trevor-noah-despite-kerfuffle/">Stewart said</a> about it?</strong><br>It was great. The truth is, people don&apos;t know me. When people don&apos;t know you, they&apos;re going to try to get to know you as quickly as possible, because you&apos;re now taking the place of somebody that they love dearly, or somebody that they hate sincerely, and so they need to know who you are. When you have a limited amount of time in the news cycle to discover who somebody is, you don&apos;t have time to watch their comedy specials. You don&apos;t have time to spend an hour. You need to get your article out as quickly as possible. How do you do that? You read a few tweets. There&apos;s nine thousand; &quot;I&apos;m just gonna type a few keywords in and see what his views are on certain things. That is my definition of him, done.&quot; Because, ironically, if you look at it, you go, &quot;OK, he wrote a tweet about Israel fighting a lot. Is this something we don&apos;t know now, all of a sudden?&quot; Israel and Palestine, they&apos;ve been fighting since the Bible. I don&apos;t understand why that makes me anti-Semitic for commenting on that. In that same logic, in that same tweet, I said, &quot;South Africa&apos;s bad at recycling.&quot; Does that mean I hate South Africa now? Am I anti-South African? No. A joke doesn&apos;t mean that. Do you get what I&apos;m saying?</p><p data-reactid=".1kb7rwf7wn4.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>You&apos;re saying every joke needs to be understood in context</strong><strong> &#x2014; </strong><strong>and as being said by you and not another person.</strong><br>Yes. That&apos;s very true. And this is another thing, my people understood it&#x2014;and when I say &quot;my people,&quot; I don&apos;t mean South Africans, &apos;cause I had followers from the U.S., I had followers from the U.K. My people were with me on the journey, you know? So yeah, there are some tweets that are like, &quot;What the hell, Trevor? That was shit. What was that?&quot; And then you go, &quot;Sorry, guys, sorry. I was a little tired when I wrote that.&quot; Or, &quot;I didn&apos;t think that through. Let me try it again.&quot; I&apos;ve done that before with tweets, where I&apos;ll go, &quot;Wait, let me rewrite that joke. OK, wait, wait, wait, one more time.&quot; And then people will be shitting on me, going, &quot;You&apos;re horrible.&quot; And we joke about it, &apos;cause people know me. They&apos;re like, &quot;Dude,&quot; you know? But I always tell people, I&apos;m like, &quot;Look, man. I&apos;m not a Twitter comedian. I&apos;m a comedian. This is a tool that I use to communicate with you and have fun and engage you in a conversation. If you wanna talk to me, you can meet me on Twitter. And if you really want to have a genuine discussion about anything, if you wanna just say, &apos;Hey, Trevor, how are you? Happy Birthday,&apos; anything.&quot; That&apos;s what Twitter&apos;s for. It&apos;s broken down barriers. So if you&apos;ve been with me on that journey, you know a bit more about who I am. So for instance, there&apos;s one tweet&#x2014;and this is what made me so angry, is that it&apos;s one thing if you say a joke is bad or something on Twitter, but I hate it when people take a thing that&apos;s not a joke and now try and make it, like&#x2014;they were like, &quot;Oh, he had a joke where he said he bumped a Jewish kid with his German car.&quot; I&apos;m like, &quot;No. I was driving, ironically, to pick my mother up from shul. In the parking lot, a little Jewish kid ran across the road. So I stopped&#x2014;like, I almost run this kid over. And I say to my brother, I&apos;m like, &apos;Can you imagine? Knocking down a little Jewish kid outside the shul? I&apos;m gonna be the guy that ran him over.&apos; And my brother says, &apos;And you drive a German car.&apos; And I&apos;m like, &apos;Oh, crap.&apos;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1kb7rwf7wn4.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Why was your mom at shul?</strong><br>Because my mom converted to Judaism. So I&apos;m having this conversation the way you would on Snapchat or the way you would just telling my friends, &quot;This happened to me today.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1kb7rwf7wn4.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>&quot;We had a funny conversation in the car.&quot;</strong><br>&quot;Here&apos;s a little piece of it.&quot; And if you know me&#x2014;and one of my friends was even like, &quot;How do you know the kid was Jewish?&quot; And I was like, &quot;Because&#x2014;&quot; And then I joked&#x2014;I was like, &quot;Because he looked Jewish. And because his parents looked Jewish. Oh, and because he was at shul.&quot; You know, I was playing, and this is now a conversation with my friend. I remember, there was one tweet they found; it was a joke that I had with a girlfriend of mine at the time. And they were like, &quot;Oh, Trevor, he fat-shames women, and he&apos;s misogynistic.&quot; No. That day, my girlfriend said to me, &quot;Man, I&apos;m getting so fat.&quot; And I was like, &quot;We&apos;re both fat right now. We&apos;ve really gotten fat.&quot; I was like, &quot;Clearly, we&apos;re extremely happy.&quot; And then she wrote on Twitter&#x2014;she was at work, and she wrote, &quot;When a woman is loved, she becomes ten times the woman that she is.&quot; And I wrote, &quot;So she becomes fat? Is that what you&apos;re saying?&quot; And that was our joke, between the two of us. People now are like, &quot;He shames his followers on Twitter. He trolls them.&quot; I&apos;m like, &quot;No. This is somebody that I loved that I was engaging with. You just walked into a conversation.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1kb7rwf7wn4.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Is the conclusion going forward that you need to take the inside jokes off Twitter?</strong><br>No, no, no. Now I give people the chance to get to know me. You&apos;ve had your chance to be angry. Fine. You know, I&apos;ll let you be angry; I have no control over that. And I understand why you would do it. It&apos;s the same thing that happened to Justine Sacco on Twitter. It&apos;s happened to people; I&apos;ve seen that Twitter outrage thing before. I&apos;ve seen people lose their jobs over it. People love full outrage. You get to be a protestor in your underwear. You don&apos;t have to leave your house.</p><p data-reactid=".1kb7rwf7wn4.1.1.0.0.4.8">And that&apos;s the world we live in now. There&apos;s more outrage on Twitter about a One Direction split or about what one band member said to another than there is about institutionalized racism and something huge. We get angry about the small things, sometimes I feel, so that we feel like we&apos;re doing something, so that we don&apos;t have to tackle the big things. And it&apos;s fine; let people do that. But I&apos;m not gonna now change because of that. You know? Like, the worst thing that happens to me is you don&apos;t like me. And then what?</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1kb7rwf7wn4.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1kb7rwf7wn4.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
