For instance: We don\u0027t often crank the same tunes as soccer moms, but Adele\u0027s irresistible Top 40 hits were as soulful as they were catchy (and offered some kind of substitute for the dearly departed Amy Winehouse). Drake did more singing than rapping this year, blogging regret-filled therapy notes (including a slow jam called, we kid you not, \u0022Trust Issues\u0022)—the opposite of gangsta, and we couldn\u0027t stop listening. Seattle\u0027s Fleet Fos served up a sublime folk album, Helplessness Blues, with frontman Robin Pecknold singing quaint songs about tending orchards and taking naps. No monster riffs and power chords, but it delivered its own kind of pastoral wallop.\u000A\u000A So yeah, it was one hell of a year to be a music fan, even if rock is apparently dead (for now).—Will Welch\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A I\u0027m just an addict / Addicted to music, the great MC Rakim once said, and Lord knows he was speaking of me, a guy who became a critic just to score free music. Spotify\u0027s stream-only service allows you to listen to pretty much everything on iTunes for a dirt-cheap ten bucks a month. It\u0027s not perfect: no Beatles, no early X-Clan. But there\u0027s enough content to keep you satisfied. I\u0027m drunk with the power to access more than 15 million songs, all automatically stored so the master mix an insomniac made at home can be enjoyed at his work computer the next morning over a cup of fair trade. Tune out your boss. Turn up DMX!\u000A\u000A My days of lugging my external hard drive stacked with 582 GB of tunes are over. Forget ownership, it\u0027s all about access now.—Elliott Wilson \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A And millions of Americans are surprised to find themselves suddenly remembering, as though awakening from a trance, how much they used to love R.E.M. How simultaneously gratifying and infuriating must this be for the band itself, after so long striving on albums that would have been slathered with praise if made by unknowns half their age but that were instead judged inadequate to the unrealistic task of living up to their past and our fond memories. It\u0027s strange how unfairly the love affair between audience and artist can turn sour. In the uphill years, the same things that were once adored—their eccentric individualism, their stubborn lack of glamour, an aura of principle and honor, the eternal Michael Stipe-ness of Michael Stipe—suddenly seemed to count against them. What had once appeared natural and unexpected and effortless was routinely scorned as labored and mannered and calculated. As with any abandoned lover, whatever they did was wrong—failing to change, changing too much; trying too hard, never trying hard enough. And now, into the space they vacate—according to a natural law of pop music and time that is both cruel and wondrous—the love we once felt for them is free to return.—Chris Heath \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Hedi Slimane/Trunk Archive\u000A\u000A __\u000A\u000A Three years ago, I spent a long night on Amy Winehouse\u0027s couch. I\u0027d shown up unannounced at her North London home, surrounded, as usual, with paparazzi. Around 4 a.m. she stuck her natty beehive out the front door, and I blurted my interview request. She smiled warmly, muttered something about \u0022the sweet little girl from Rolling Stone,\u0022 and ushered me inside.\u000A\u000A Her home was an anesthetized dreamworld, the air thick with smoke, the living room floor strewn with expensive clothes and half-eaten snacks. Winehouse pinballed around the messy haze, licking her lips, picking things up, putting them down. She looked emaciated, and I felt a wave of raw sadness. She was so open, so real, and so so so fucking high.\u000A\u000A Drugs, death, and love were top of her mind that night. Her then husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, was in jail, and she was heartbroken, saying she\u0027d rather be dead than without him. Dying, she knew, was something everyone expected of her. She felt it was coming, too. Her fame had been fast: She was 20 when her first album, Frank, dazzled British critics (eventually going platinum). By that night in June 2008, it had been two years since she\u0027d blown us all away with Back to Black—her boozy, funny, hip-hop-inflected riff on \u002760s soul—and at least as long since she\u0027d been a junkie. She told me many of her friends and relatives had written her off already: You\u0027re fine, not dead? Okay, good-bye. \u000A\u000A At the same time, she clung to an odd sort of optimism—that somehow she might emerge from the other side of this cracked-out darkness and be the fully realized talent she was meant to be, giving us more of her powerful music and living life in full. \u0022I want babies,\u0022 she told me excitedly. \u0022My friend had a dream that I was pregnant, and I believe in that kind of premonition.\u0022\u000A\u000A After four hours, she led me to the front door and hugged me good-bye. Like so many of her fans, I hoped for her to get better, keep recording, keep performing. But she never made another album. She spent the next few years in and out of rehab. Her concerts were canceled or humiliating train wrecks.\u000A\u000A In the five years since Back to Black (now the UK\u0027s best-selling album of the twenty-first century), we\u0027ve heard a lot of girls try to fill the void left by Winehouse. But even the best can\u0027t touch the purity, the gritty honesty, the dark wit, of Amy\u0027s talent. She did something original, singing about rehab and fuck-me-pumps as if they were the stuff of ballads. It\u0027s hard not to be nostalgic for her wry sense that the absurdities of life could make a hell of a song.—Claire Hoffman \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A \u0022There were never any babies in Miles\u0027s bands. There was no how-to manual, no preparation backstage. Nobody knows how to deal with the unexpected; this band was a training ground for the unexpected.\u0022—Saxophonist Wayne Shorter \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A To illuminate just how cockeyed the music world has become: It took a slick pop producer to make the one truly rockin\u0027 album of the year. \u0022The Black Lips are certainly more DIY and punk in spirit than other bands I work with,\u0022 says Mark Ronson, best known for coaxing perfect RB-tinged hits out of Amy Winehouse and Adele. \u0022But I love the rawness of \u002760s garage rock. I love this band.\u0022 You can tell: Arabia Mountain is a grimy, joyful shot of kick in the ass. Not only did the bespoke-suit-wearing producer manage to effectively bottle the sound of a band most famous for spitting in one another\u0027s mouths onstage; he cheated death in the process. \u0022They took me to dinner and ordered liver sashimi,\u0022 says Ronson. \u0022Part of a fucking cow that they didn\u0027t cook. I got seriously ill, a pre-the-Great-War-type fever\u0022 that required hospitalization. Says Lips singer Jared Swilley: \u0022We poisoned him, and he was totally down with that. He\u0027s part of the family now.\u0022—Lizzy Goodman\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A New York\u0027s indie-rock queen, born Annie Clark, has it all: the ax chops of a pimply teenager lurking around Guitar Center; impeccable comedy taste (her album title Marry Me is an Arrested Development ref!); retro, girl-next-door sex appeal; and a refined collection of steely, knowing pop songs (Exhibit A: \u0022Surgeon\u0022). Not to mention the good sense to accept GQ\u0027s affection. \u0022Should I say, \u0027No, not me\u0027?\u0022 responds Clark. \u0022Nah, I\u0027m not going to apologize for being really psyched about it.\u0022—Amos Barshad\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A There are the artists who get all the media attention and the ones we really live with (which, granted, are sometimes one and the same). Here, we draw a line between the year\u0027s most hyped albums (left) and the ones that became our 2011 soundtrack (right). Plus, a few droppable names and trends to prove you were paying attention—Sean Fennessey and Will Welch \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Photos: Courtesy of Anton Corbijn (R.E.M), Jan Persson (Miles Davis), Courtesy of Matthew Frost (Mark Ronson), David Atlas/Retna/Corbis (St. Vincent)",

Drake did more singing than rapping this year, blogging regret-filled therapy notes (including a slow jam called, we kid you not, &quot;Trust Issues&quot;)&#x2014;the opposite of gangsta, and we couldn&#x2019;t stop listening.

How simultaneously gratifying and infuriating must this be for the band itself, after so long striving on albums that would have been slathered with praise if made by unknowns half their age but that were instead judged inadequate to the unrealistic task of living up to their past and our fond memories. It&#x2019;s strange how unfairly the love affair between audience and artist can turn sour. In the uphill years, the same things that were once adored&#x2014;their eccentric individualism, their stubborn lack of glamour, an aura of principle and honor, the eternal Michael Stipe-ness of Michael Stipe&#x2014;suddenly seemed to count against them. What had once appeared natural and unexpected and effortless was routinely scorned as labored and mannered and calculated. As with any abandoned lover, whatever they did was wrong&#x2014;failing to change, changing too much; trying too hard, never trying hard enough. And now, into the space they vacate&#x2014;according to a natural law of pop music and time that is both cruel and wondrous&#x2014;the love we once felt for them is free to return.&#x2014;<em>Chris Heath </em></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.b"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d6e43655c24c6c94b134/master/w_806/entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-fade-to-black.jpg" alt="entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-fade-to-black.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;t=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-fade-to-black.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;t=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-fade-to-black.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d6e43655c24c6c94b134%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-fade-to-black.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-fade-to-black.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d6e43655c24c6c94b134%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-fade-to-black.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-fade-to-black.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.c"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d6e309f0bee564402232/master/w_806/entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-amy-winehouse-image.jpg" alt="entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-amy-winehouse-image.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;t=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-amy-winehouse-image.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;t=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-amy-winehouse-image.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d6e309f0bee564402232%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-amy-winehouse-image.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-amy-winehouse-image.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d6e309f0bee564402232%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-amy-winehouse-image.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-amy-winehouse-image.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Hedi Slimane/Trunk Archive</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.d"> __</p><p data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.e"> Three years ago, I spent a long night on Amy Winehouse&#x2019;s couch. I&#x2019;d shown up unannounced at her North London home, surrounded, as usual, with paparazzi. Around 4 a.m. she stuck her natty beehive out the front door, and I blurted my interview request. She smiled warmly, muttered something about &quot;the sweet little girl from <em>Rolling Stone</em>,&quot; and ushered me inside.</p><p data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.f"> Her home was an anesthetized dreamworld, the air thick with smoke, the living room floor strewn with expensive clothes and half-eaten snacks. Winehouse pinballed around the messy haze, licking her lips, picking things up, putting them down. She looked emaciated, and I felt a wave of raw sadness. She was so open, so real, and so so so fucking high.</p><p data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.g"> Drugs, death, and love were top of her mind that night. Her then husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, was in jail, and she was heartbroken, saying she&#x2019;d rather be dead than without him. Dying, she knew, was something everyone expected of her. She felt it was coming, too. Her fame had been fast: She was 20 when her first album, <em>Frank</em>, dazzled British critics (eventually going platinum). By that night in June 2008, it had been two years since she&#x2019;d blown us all away with <em>Back to Black</em>&#x2014;her boozy, funny, hip-hop-inflected riff on &#x2019;60s soul&#x2014;and at least as long since she&#x2019;d been a junkie. She told me many of her friends and relatives had written her off already: You&#x2019;re fine, not dead? Okay, good-bye. </p><p data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.h"> At the same time, she clung to an odd sort of optimism&#x2014;that somehow she might emerge from the other side of this cracked-out darkness and be the fully realized talent she was meant to be, giving us more of her powerful music and living life in full. &quot;I want babies,&quot; she told me excitedly. &quot;My friend had a dream that I was pregnant, and I believe in that kind of premonition.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.i"> After four hours, she led me to the front door and hugged me good-bye. Like so many of her fans, I hoped for her to get better, keep recording, keep performing. But she never made another album. She spent the next few years in and out of rehab. Her concerts were canceled or humiliating train wrecks.</p><p data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.j"> In the five years since <em>Back to Black</em> (now the UK&#x2019;s best-selling album of the twenty-first century), we&#x2019;ve heard a lot of girls try to fill the void left by Winehouse. But even the best can&#x2019;t touch the purity, the gritty honesty, the dark wit, of Amy&#x2019;s talent. She did something original, singing about rehab and fuck-me-pumps as if they were the stuff of ballads. It&#x2019;s hard not to be nostalgic for her wry sense that the absurdities of life could make a hell of a song.&#x2014;<em>Claire Hoffman </em></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.k"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d6e409f0bee564402235/master/w_806/entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-killingest-jazz.jpg" alt="entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-killingest-jazz.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;t=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-killingest-jazz.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;t=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-killingest-jazz.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d6e409f0bee564402235%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-killingest-jazz.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-killingest-jazz.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d6e409f0bee564402235%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-killingest-jazz.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-banner-killingest-jazz.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.l"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d6e409f0bee56440223d/master/w_806/entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-miles-davis-image.jpg" alt="entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-miles-davis-image.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;t=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-miles-davis-image.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;t=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-miles-davis-image.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d6e409f0bee56440223d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-miles-davis-image.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-miles-davis-image.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fyear-in-music-review-best-artists-albums&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d6e409f0bee56440223d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-miles-davis-image.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-12-year-in-music-miles-davis-image.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".2codcwz6ayo.1.1.0.0.4.m"> &quot;There were never any babies in Miles&#x2019;s bands.

I love this band.&quot; You can tell: <em>Arabia Mountain</em> is a grimy, joyful shot of kick in the ass. Not only did the bespoke-suit-wearing producer manage to effectively bottle the sound of a band most famous for spitting in one another&#x2019;s mouths onstage; he cheated death in the process. &quot;They took me to dinner and ordered liver sashimi,&quot; says Ronson. &quot;Part of a fucking cow that they didn&#x2019;t cook. I got seriously ill, a pre-the-Great-War-type fever&quot; that required hospitalization. Says Lips singer Jared Swilley: &quot;We poisoned him, and he was totally down with that.
