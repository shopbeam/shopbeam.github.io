  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AYou may have heard that Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the newest issue of\u000A\u000A GQ. How did that happen? Our creative director Jim Moore talks about the vision for the cover alongside editor-in-chief Jim Nelson, how she got that look with styling by GQ fashion director Madeline Weeks and bookings director Victoria Graham, and her supreme skills as a model.\u000A\u000AWhat was it like working with Kendall the model versus Kendall the celebrity?\u000A\u000A Kendall brought an incredible amount of professionalism with her 19 years of age! I\u0027ve seen great high fashion pictures of her in Vogue, and her ad campaigns, but this is GQ, so we wanted to photograph her in a very natural way, a very sensual way, and a very all-American way. I think we all feel we know her because she is a pop culture phenomenon--a reality star--and I know that she comes off on the show as being a little bit reserved and I was curious as to how she was going to handle it. At the end of the day I was incredibly pleasantly surprised. I realize she is a personality, but she wants to make it as a model and she wants to show up and do her part. Her understanding of what a men\u0027s cover is over a woman\u0027s fashion cover is very astute. She understood that we wanted her in something a little more revealing and she was up for that.\u000A\u000ASo it was easy to shoot?\u000A\u000A I feel like the images came very early in the session. Steven Klein is a profound artist and has definitely shot some of the best celebrities and models in the world, including a very sexy image of Adriana Lima for our cover a few years back. I\u0027ve worked with Steven a few times before and he is very decisive, very quick in finding the great moment. Most people look at these beautiful pictures and they think that they must be labored over, but they\u0027re actually not. At any given shoot there are a dozen people on set and this was no exception, there were lots of people around, looking at the monitor, fussing with her, looking at her. She\u0027s getting direction from a few of us and she\u0027s not phased by it. She knows what to do, she knows what we\u0027re looking for and she brings a lot to it. All of her facial expressions and everything-she brought all of that. She tried things and those images ended up making the cut. A great model does that, it\u0027s part of his or her job.\u000A\u000AOnce you met her, did she alter your expectations for the images?\u000A\u000A Yes. She\u0027s a very natural girl, she\u0027s a California girl, she\u0027s a very beautiful girl, so she doesn\u0027t need a lot of makeup. She doesn\u0027t need a lot of anything, really. She\u0027s got a perfect figure. High fashion demands tall and slim and beautiful and she has all of that, but I think what she brought to it is a personality, and you see that in the pictures. She\u0027s engaging. I didn\u0027t expect her to be so charismatic and I think that for a young girl she brought a lot to the session.\u000A\u000ATell me about the cover.\u000A\u000A When you\u0027re shooting a cover, it\u0027s that golden moment. It\u0027s the setup that you spend the most time on. We did so many cover choices that we actually had a hard time choosing one because there were so many great ones. But this one, the way she\u0027s turned to the camera, the way that her hair is moving, the freshness of the look of her... There\u0027s a little bit of that California girl there, but there\u0027s also a sophisticated woman. She is engaged with the camera, and ultimately, with the reader. There\u0027s someone who\u0027s definitely in charge yet is open to the world. Steven was very gracious and directable when I said, Okay, Kendall open yourself up a little bit more, and she opened her jean jacket and there was a little bit of wind in her hair and I remember seeing that frame and was like, That\u0027s a great cover!\u000A\u000AShe\u0027s able to look both tantalizing, but also, really accessible at the same moment.\u000A\u000A I think that she is very beautiful. It is in a way a coincidence that she happened to be born into this family. Models are all about what is the look, there\u0027s a lot of girls out there that are really beautiful, but it\u0027s like you have to be at the sweet spot where you have the look that every designer is looking for. Kendall is a little bit of an exception. When she came on the scene everything was very European looking, and exotic and blonde, she came on with this young Ali Macgraw look. Some designers interpret her as a young \u002770s ingenue, some people see her as really modern, some people could see her as having this cultural royalty-and she\u0027s kind of all of that. That\u0027s why she\u0027s great.\u000A\u000AIn a way, it\u0027s like, What is it about Kendall that makes her so real and genuine? She\u0027s just being real and genuine. She\u0027s just being Kendall. She loves to model, she shows up, she puts on the clothes, and she brings a lot to the set. Just because she has this pedigree doesn\u0027t mean she\u0027s going to be this sensation. If she was a wallflower, if she was going to be intimidated by the camera, it just wouldn\u0027t work. If she\u0027s going to bring something, every photographer in the world wants to work with her because she is beautiful, but also she is fun-loving and you can see it in her pictures.\u000A\u000AHow was the decision made to put Kendall on the cover?\u000A\u000A We were looking for the It Girl. We take all of our covers very seriously and we do very few female covers, so we wanted to land on someone who was important in the culture, but also someone to show in our way. I think Kendall has been percolating a lot on the high fashion scene and she\u0027s getting to that point, she\u0027s signed a contract with Estee Lauder, she\u0027s been in Vogue, so she\u0027s definitely a rising star. We wanted to grab her on her way up and show our readers how GQ would show her in a picture. If there were ten people in that meeting and Jim Nelson said, Who loves Kendall Jenner? every hand went up. She has a lot of fans here at the magazine.",

that Kendall Jenner is on the <a href="../entertainment/celebrities/201505/kendall-jenner-cover-story">cover</a> of the newest issue of</p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.2"> <em>GQ</em>. How did that happen? Our creative director Jim Moore talks about the vision for the cover alongside editor-in-chief Jim Nelson, how she got that look with styling by GQ fashion director Madeline Weeks and bookings director Victoria Graham, and her supreme skills as a model.</p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>What was it like working with Kendall the model versus Kendall the celebrity?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.5"> Kendall brought an incredible amount of professionalism with her 19 years of age! I&#x2019;ve seen great high fashion pictures of her in Vogue, and her ad campaigns, but this is GQ, so we wanted to photograph her in a very natural way, a very sensual way, and a very all-American way. I think we all feel we know her because she is a pop culture phenomenon--a reality star--and I know that she comes off on the show as being a little bit reserved and I was curious as to how she was going to handle it. At the end of the day I was incredibly pleasantly surprised. I realize she is a personality, but she wants to make it as a model and she wants to show up and do her part. Her understanding of what a men&#x2019;s cover is over a woman&#x2019;s fashion cover is very astute. She understood that we wanted her in something a little more revealing and she was up for that.</p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>So it was easy to shoot?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.7"> I feel like the images came very early in the session. Steven Klein is a profound artist and has definitely shot some of the best celebrities and models in the world, including a very sexy image of Adriana Lima for our cover a few years back. I&#x2019;ve worked with Steven a few times before and he is very decisive, very quick in finding the great moment. Most people look at these beautiful pictures and they think that they must be labored over, but they&#x2019;re actually not. At any given shoot there are a dozen people on set and this was no exception, there were lots of people around, looking at the monitor, fussing with her, looking at her. She&#x2019;s getting direction from a few of us and she&#x2019;s not phased by it. She knows what to do, she knows what we&#x2019;re looking for and she brings a lot to it. All of her facial expressions and everything-she brought all of that. She tried things and those images ended up making the cut. A great model does that, it&#x2019;s part of his or her job.</p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Once you met her, did she alter your expectations for the images?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.9"> Yes. She&#x2019;s a very natural girl, she&#x2019;s a California girl, she&#x2019;s a very beautiful girl, so she doesn&#x2019;t need a lot of makeup. She doesn&#x2019;t need a lot of anything, really. She&#x2019;s got a perfect figure. High fashion demands tall and slim and beautiful and she has all of that, but I think what she brought to it is a personality, and you see that in the pictures. She&#x2019;s engaging. I didn&#x2019;t expect her to be so charismatic and I think that for a young girl she brought a lot to the session.</p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Tell me about the cover.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.b"> When you&#x2019;re shooting a cover, it&#x2019;s that golden moment. It&#x2019;s the setup that you spend the most time on. We did so many cover choices that we actually had a hard time choosing one because there were so many great ones. But this one, the way she&#x2019;s turned to the camera, the way that her hair is moving, the freshness of the look of her... There&#x2019;s a little bit of that California girl there, but there&#x2019;s also a sophisticated woman. She is engaged with the camera, and ultimately, with the reader. There&#x2019;s someone who&#x2019;s definitely in charge yet is open to the world. Steven was very gracious and directable when I said, Okay, Kendall open yourself up a little bit more, and she opened her jean jacket and there was a little bit of wind in her hair and I remember seeing that frame and was like, That&#x2019;s a great cover!</p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>She&#x2019;s able to look both tantalizing, but also, really accessible at the same moment.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.d"> I think that she is very beautiful. It is in a way a coincidence that she happened to be born into this family. Models are all about what is the look, there&#x2019;s a lot of girls out there that are really beautiful, but it&#x2019;s like you have to be at the sweet spot where you have the look that every designer is looking for. Kendall is a little bit of an exception. When she came on the scene everything was very European looking, and exotic and blonde, she came on with this young Ali Macgraw look. Some designers interpret her as a young &#x2019;70s ingenue, some people see her as really modern, some people could see her as having this cultural royalty-and she&#x2019;s kind of all of that. That&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;s great.</p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.e">In a way, it&#x2019;s like, What is it about Kendall that makes her so real and genuine? She&#x2019;s just being real and genuine. She&#x2019;s just being Kendall. She loves to model, she shows up, she puts on the clothes, and she brings a lot to the set. Just because she has this pedigree doesn&#x2019;t mean she&#x2019;s going to be this sensation. If she was a wallflower, if she was going to be intimidated by the camera, it just wouldn&#x2019;t work. If she&#x2019;s going to bring something, every photographer in the world wants to work with her because she is beautiful, but also she is fun-loving and you can see it in her pictures.</p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>How was the decision made to put Kendall on the cover?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.4.g"> We were looking for the It Girl. We take all of our covers very seriously and we do very few female covers, so we wanted to land on someone who was important in the culture, but also someone to show in our way. I think Kendall has been percolating a lot on the high fashion scene and she&#x2019;s getting to that point, she&#x2019;s signed a contract with Estee Lauder, she&#x2019;s been in <em>Vogue</em>, so she&#x2019;s definitely a rising star. We wanted to grab her on her way up and show our readers how <em>GQ</em> would show her in a picture. If there were ten people in that meeting and Jim Nelson said, Who loves Kendall Jenner? every hand went up. She has a lot of fans here at the magazine.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".2cawbuj30g0.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
