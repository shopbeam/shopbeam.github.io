  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000APhoto: Pan-Mass Challenge\u000A\u000AFormer Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown lost his seat in 2012, and then lost a comeback bid in New Hampshire in 2014. So, what\u0027s he been up to? For the past few months, the longtime triathlete and cycling enthusiast has been volunteering at Gus\u0027 Bike Shop in North Hampton, New Hampshire, as a bike mechanic. GQ spoke with Brown about his passion for cycling, touring in Europe, and what it\u0027s like to get blown up by bad drivers.\u000A\u000AHow did you become interested in bikes?\u000A\u000A Scott Brown: I was playing basketball after college in a summer league and got elbowed in the eye and needed 30 stitches. I\u0027m like, \u0022Okay, this is getting a little too rough,\u0022 so I started running. Then I had a good friend who was a duathlete. So I went and did one [race], and I actually won my age group. I walked away with a trophy and was like, \u0022Man this is great. I love this.\u0022\u000A\u000ATell me about your time racing in Europe.\u000A\u000A There\u0027s nothing better than riding bikes in the Spanish Pyrenees. The incredible history there, Basque country, where we were going by farmhouses built in the 400s. Culturally, it was extremely gratifying.\u000A\u000ADid you get to tour while there?\u000A\u000A We\u0027d get there four or five days before a race. Like most people, I\u0027d want to rest, check out the course. And then we\u0027d do the race and [after] it\u0027s like, \u0022Okay, let\u0027s go grab some beers, and we\u0027ll go visit this, and do that.\u0022 In the beginning it\u0027s all about getting ready for the race. Once the race is over, it\u0027s all about immersing ourselves in the culture of where we are.\u000A\u000AIs there a thrilling bike experience that jumps out?\u000A\u000A In Spain we were flying down the mountain 50 miles an hour, cliff on the left, cliff on the right, and it\u0027s like, \u0022Holy shit, if my tire blows I\u0027m gone.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s your most grueling cycling experience?\u000A\u000A I did a race down in Maryland. It was one of those crazy hot days—humidity was off the charts, no breeze—where you just melt. You saw the little heat waves, like you could almost fry an egg. I just remember having to get intravenous after the race.\u000A\u000AYou had to get IV fluids?\u000A\u000A Oh yeah, I\u0027ve done that a few times.\u000A\u000AAnd you finished?\u000A\u000A I\u0027ve never not finished a race.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s your training regimen like? \u000A\u000A I almost do a triathlon every day. It doesn\u0027t necessarily need to be all at one time. And I\u0027m actually finding as I get older it\u0027s better to split it up. I\u0027m probably working out a good two, two and a half hours a day.\u000A\u000AWhere\u0027s your favorite place to ride?\u000A\u000A Route 1A starting in Portsmouth and going along down the coast. It\u0027s just breathtaking riding all along the ocean. The second best situation is when I do it on a tandem with my wife. We did the Pan-Mass challenge last year on our tandem. That was 111 miles together in the pouring rain.\u000A\u000AYou ride a tandem?\u000A\u000A I would go out for a ride and my wife would say, \u0022What about me? How come I can\u0027t go ride?\u0022 So I said, \u0022Well, you can\u0027t keep up with me.\u0022 So she says, \u0022Why don\u0027t we get a tandem, and then you can\u0027t get rid of me?\u0022 So we\u0027ll go out for a nice 10-15 mile ride and then I\u0027ll get on my bike and go for another 10-15 miles. So I get the workout in, she\u0027s happy, we spend a lot of quality time together. It\u0027s the best of both worlds. We have two tandem bikes, actually.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s the difference between road and triathlete riders? \u000A\u000A It\u0027s kind of clique-y. When I\u0027m out riding I say hi to everybody. A lot of the traditional road bike folks don\u0027t even acknowledge your existence because you\u0027re a tri guy. Once I did a joint ride and a guy came up and said, \u0022You know, you can\u0027t do your aerobars because you may hurt somebody.\u0022 I\u0027m like, \u0022First of all, no offense, but I\u0027ve been riding since I was five. I know the rules of the road—and I\u0027ll be way ahead of you so don\u0027t worry about it.\u0022\u000A\u000AAre you familiar with the term \u0022tri-dork\u0022?\u000A\u000A Oh yeah. It\u0027s usually \u0022tri-geek\u0022 though.\u000A\u000AIs that something you\u0027ve ever had thrown at you?\u000A\u000A Of course. I usually just give it right back. I\u0027m not shy. I\u0027ll walk away and say, \u0022By the way, do you see this?\u0022 They go, \u0022No, what?\u0022 \u0022It\u0027s my backside. That\u0027s what you\u0027ll be seeing when I blow by you.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s all fun though. It\u0027s not serious confrontation. It\u0027s just guy stuff.\u000A\u000ACycling often has a reputation as being insular and abrasive. Is that something you\u0027ve experienced?\u000A\u000A One of the things I like most about triathletes is they are very competitive, exceedingly intense during the race. But once the race is over, everyone\u0027s like buddy buddy. There\u0027s a mutual respect because very few people actually do triathlons. But y\u0027know, you get some jerks, like every sport.\u000A\u000AEver ridden a fid gear?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t think I have. I\u0027d like to try going around a track. That looks so cool.\u000A\u000AWho are your cycling idols?\u000A\u000A Like many people, Lance Armstrong. I did the Pan-Mass with him. I used to have his poster hanging in my Senate office. Lance was the guy. Obviously very disappointed to learn about what he was doing.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s your gnarliest crash story?\u000A\u000A That\u0027s easy. I was in Fooro on Route 140, fully tucked, blasting along, minding my own business. There was a car that went from a Dunkin Donuts into a Dairy Queen and basically stopped in the middle of where I was going. The curb was too high for me to jump, cars were too close on the left, so I basically had to slam on my brakes and started fishtailing. I literally flipped the car. Pretty banged up, screwed up my knee. Had to get a couple of operations. They basically said I\u0027d never run again, or that I shouldn\u0027t run again. Now I\u0027m banging out 6:20 miles, so that wasn\u0027t quite right.\u000A\u000AHave you ever been doored?\u000A\u000A I\u0027ve certainly been run off the road with cars who were just being total dicks—drivers who were being total jerks, I should say. The motto for anybody who rides a bike is, \u0022Those who crash and those who will.\u0022 It\u0027s inevitable.\u000A\u000AEver have a mechanical failure in the middle of nowhere?\u000A\u000A That\u0027s one of the reasons I said, \u0022I want to fix bikes.\u0022 My wife usually gets those calls, \u0022Hi, honey, can you pick me up?\u0022 Or I\u0027ll just start walking and folks will recognize me and say, \u0022Hey, Senator, you need a ride?\u0022\u000A\u000ADo people recognize you when you\u0027re out riding?\u000A\u000A All the time. I\u0027m a fixture along the seacoast and at the races. A lot of people will actually say, \u0022I came to this race because I knew you were here and I\u0027m just here to try to beat you.\u0022 And I\u0027m like, \u0022Okay, good luck with that.\u0022\u000A\u000ADo any victories stick out in your mind?\u000A\u000A What I find gratifying [now] is I\u0027ll be racing and have a couple kids—18, 19, 20 years old—racing beside me, and I\u0027ll try to stay with them. We\u0027ll battle and battle and battle. And then finally—this works every time, and it\u0027s hilarious—I\u0027ll look at them and I\u0027ll say, \u0022You guys are doing really great. I\u0027m surprised I can hang with you. Do you know I could be your father?\u0022\u000A\u000ANine times out of 10 they slow down and just kind of give up and I\u0027ll be able to sneak in ahead of them. It\u0027s not only gratifying, but it\u0027s really funny.\u000A\u000ACycling is full of subcultures. Any others you\u0027d like to be involved in? \u000A\u000A I\u0027d like to do some good mountain bike riding up through the woods. I haven\u0027t really done that. Get a good mountain bike and bang it out with some buddies. I\u0027ve always wanted to go to New Zealand or Scotland or Wales and just ride 100 miles, hit a pub, drink, eat, sleep, do some exploring, and then get up, ride another 100 miles, do that for a couple weeks.\u000A\u000AHow many bikes do you own?\u000A\u000A I\u0027ve got two tandems. I don\u0027t know the names but I just ride them. I still have a Trek TTX 9.9—carbon fiber, high end, fairly expensive bike. It\u0027s a 2010. That\u0027s what I was racing on until I got a Felt IA. I\u0027ve got four bikes total.\u000A\u000AHow did you get into bike maintenance, and why now?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t want people to think this is a full-time job. In the winter I\u0027d go in and spend eight hours a day just learning. When I wasn\u0027t working or travelling I\u0027d like to just get out of the house. It was fun. I get a kick out of people saying, \u0022Well, he was a senator and now he\u0027s a bike mechanic.\u0022\u000A\u000ANo, I\u0027m blessed. I\u0027m doing something that I\u0027ve always wanted to do. I enjoy it. Am I going to do it forever? I could. I may. The people at the shop are nice, they\u0027re hardworking business people, and they\u0027ve been very good to me.\u000A\u000AHow deep are you trying to get into the inner workings of bikes?\u000A\u000A I can take a bike out of the box, put it together A-Z. I\u0027m trying to learn it all.\u000A\u000AWhat was the learning curve like?\u000A\u000A In the beginning it was ugly. But now I\u0027m helping a lot of the younger kids that are coming in. It\u0027s a personal satisfaction thing, nothing more.\u000A\u000ACycling attracts a lot of politicians. Why do you think that is?\u000A\u000A [Secretary of State] John [Kerry] and I used to ride a lot. [Sen. Rob] Portman, [Sen. Mark] Warner, Kerry, and me—we\u0027d go out pretty regularly discussing politics half of the way and just riding or racing the remaining half. It\u0027s a good way to free your mind and get that heart pumping, find that balance that\u0027s sometimes lacking, clear your head and keep the stress level down.\u000A\u000AYou once described Kerry as a \u0022very good athlete.\u0022 What\u0027s it like riding with him?\u000A\u000A He\u0027s a very, very good rider. Strong rider, technical rider, confident rider. We\u0027ve had many good rides where we\u0027re both pretty much at the maximum moving with the younger guys.\u000A\u000AAny advice to non-cyclists interested in getting on a bike?\u000A\u000A Just do it. Go with comfort first. You don\u0027t need to get the most expensive bike. Just get on it and start and see what happens.\u000A\u000AThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",

Challenge</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.2">Former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown lost his seat in 2012, and then lost a comeback bid in New Hampshire in 2014. So, what&#x2019;s he been up to? For the past few months, the longtime triathlete and cycling enthusiast has been volunteering at Gus&#x2019; Bike Shop in North Hampton, New Hampshire, <a href="http://politicalwire.com/2015/06/15/from-senator-to-bike-repair/">as a bike mechanic</a>. <em>GQ</em> spoke with Brown about his passion for cycling, touring in Europe, and what it&#x2019;s like to get blown up by bad drivers.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>How did you become interested in bikes?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.5"> Scott Brown: I was playing basketball after college in a summer league and got elbowed in the eye and needed 30 stitches. I&#x2019;m like, &quot;Okay, this is getting a little too rough,&quot; so I started running. Then I had a good friend who was a duathlete. So I went and did one [race], and I actually won my age group. I walked away with a trophy and was like, &quot;Man this is great. I love this.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Tell me about your time racing in Europe.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.7"> There&#x2019;s nothing better than riding bikes in the Spanish Pyrenees. The incredible history there, Basque country, where we were going by farmhouses built in the 400s. Culturally, it was extremely gratifying.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Did you get to tour while there?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.9"> We&#x2019;d get there four or five days before a race. Like most people, I&#x2019;d want to rest, check out the course. And then we&#x2019;d do the race and [after] it&#x2019;s like, &quot;Okay, let&#x2019;s go grab some beers, and we&#x2019;ll go visit this, and do that.&quot; In the beginning it&#x2019;s all about getting ready for the race. Once the race is over, it&#x2019;s all about immersing ourselves in the culture of where we are.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Is there a thrilling bike experience that jumps out?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.b"> In Spain we were flying down the mountain 50 miles an hour, cliff on the left, cliff on the right, and it&#x2019;s like, &quot;Holy shit, if my tire blows I&#x2019;m gone.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>What&#x2019;s your most grueling cycling experience?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.d"> I did a race down in Maryland. It was one of those crazy hot days&#x2014;humidity was off the charts, no breeze&#x2014;where you just melt. You saw the little heat waves, like you could almost fry an egg. I just remember having to get intravenous after the race.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>You had to get IV fluids?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.f"> Oh yeah, I&#x2019;ve done that a few times.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>And you finished?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.h"> I&#x2019;ve never not finished a race.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>What&#x2019;s your training regimen like? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.j"> I almost do a triathlon every day. It doesn&#x2019;t necessarily need to be all at one time. And I&#x2019;m actually finding as I get older it&#x2019;s better to split it up. I&#x2019;m probably working out a good two, two and a half hours a day.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Where&#x2019;s your favorite place to ride?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.l"> Route 1A starting in Portsmouth and going along down the coast. It&#x2019;s just breathtaking riding all along the ocean. The second best situation is when I do it on a tandem with my wife. We did the Pan-Mass challenge last year on our tandem. That was 111 miles together in the pouring rain.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>You ride a tandem?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.n"> I would go out for a ride and my wife would say, &quot;What about me? How come I can&#x2019;t go ride?&quot; So I said, &quot;Well, you can&#x2019;t keep up with me.&quot; So she says, &quot;Why don&#x2019;t we get a tandem, and then you can&#x2019;t get rid of me?&quot; So we&#x2019;ll go out for a nice 10-15 mile ride and then I&#x2019;ll get on my bike and go for another 10-15 miles. So I get the workout in, she&#x2019;s happy, we spend a lot of quality time together. It&#x2019;s the best of both worlds. We have two tandem bikes, actually.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>What&#x2019;s the difference between road and triathlete riders? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.p"> It&#x2019;s kind of clique-y. When I&#x2019;m out riding I say hi to everybody. A lot of the traditional road bike folks don&#x2019;t even acknowledge your existence because you&#x2019;re a tri guy. Once I did a joint ride and a guy came up and said, &quot;You know, you can&#x2019;t do your aerobars because you may hurt somebody.&quot; I&#x2019;m like, &quot;First of all, no offense, but I&#x2019;ve been riding since I was five. I know the rules of the road&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ll be way ahead of you so don&#x2019;t worry about it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>Are you familiar with the term &quot;tri-dork&quot;?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.r"> Oh yeah. It&#x2019;s usually &quot;tri-geek&quot; though.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>Is that something you&#x2019;ve ever had thrown at you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.t"> Of course. I usually just give it right back. I&#x2019;m not shy. I&#x2019;ll walk away and say, &quot;By the way, do you see this?&quot; They go, &quot;No, what?&quot; &quot;It&#x2019;s my backside. That&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;ll be seeing when I blow by you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.u">It&#x2019;s all fun though. It&#x2019;s not serious confrontation. It&#x2019;s just guy stuff.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>Cycling often has a reputation as being insular and abrasive. Is that something you&#x2019;ve experienced?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.w"> One of the things I like most about triathletes is they are very competitive, exceedingly intense during the race. But once the race is over, everyone&#x2019;s like buddy buddy. There&#x2019;s a mutual respect because very few people actually do triathlons. But y&#x2019;know, you get some jerks, like every sport.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>Ever ridden a fid gear?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.y"> I don&#x2019;t think I have. I&#x2019;d like to try going around a track. That looks so cool.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>Who are your cycling idols?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.10"> Like many people, Lance Armstrong. I did the Pan-Mass with him. I used to have his poster hanging in my Senate office. Lance was the guy. Obviously very disappointed to learn about what he was doing.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong>What&#x2019;s your gnarliest crash story?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.12"> That&#x2019;s easy. I was in Fooro on Route 140, fully tucked, blasting along, minding my own business. There was a car that went from a Dunkin Donuts into a Dairy Queen and basically stopped in the middle of where I was going. The curb was too high for me to jump, cars were too close on the left, so I basically had to slam on my brakes and started fishtailing. I literally flipped the car. Pretty banged up, screwed up my knee. Had to get a couple of operations. They basically said I&#x2019;d never run again, or that I shouldn&#x2019;t run again. Now I&#x2019;m banging out 6:20 miles, so that wasn&#x2019;t quite right.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>Have you ever been doored?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.14"> I&#x2019;ve certainly been run off the road with cars who were just being total dicks&#x2014;drivers who were being total jerks, I should say. The motto for anybody who rides a bike is, &quot;Those who crash and those who will.&quot; It&#x2019;s inevitable.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>Ever have a mechanical failure in the middle of nowhere?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.16"> That&#x2019;s one of the reasons I said, &quot;I want to fix bikes.&quot; My wife usually gets those calls, &quot;Hi, honey, can you pick me up?&quot; Or I&#x2019;ll just start walking and folks will recognize me and say, &quot;Hey, Senator, you need a ride?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.17"><strong>Do people recognize you when you&#x2019;re out riding?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.18"> All the time. I&#x2019;m a fixture along the seacoast and at the races. A lot of people will actually say, &quot;I came to this race because I knew you were here and I&#x2019;m just here to try to beat you.&quot; And I&#x2019;m like, &quot;Okay, good luck with that.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.19"><strong>Do any victories stick out in your mind?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> What I find gratifying [now] is I&#x2019;ll be racing and have a couple kids&#x2014;18, 19, 20 years old&#x2014;racing beside me, and I&#x2019;ll try to stay with them. We&#x2019;ll battle and battle and battle. And then finally&#x2014;this works every time, and it&#x2019;s hilarious&#x2014;I&#x2019;ll look at them and I&#x2019;ll say, &quot;You guys are doing really great. I&#x2019;m surprised I can hang with you. Do you know I could be your father?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1b">Nine times out of 10 they slow down and just kind of give up and I&#x2019;ll be able to sneak in ahead of them. It&#x2019;s not only gratifying, but it&#x2019;s really funny.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1c"><strong>Cycling is full of subcultures. Any others you&#x2019;d like to be involved in? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1d"> I&#x2019;d like to do some good mountain bike riding up through the woods. I haven&#x2019;t really done that. Get a good mountain bike and bang it out with some buddies. I&#x2019;ve always wanted to go to New Zealand or Scotland or Wales and just ride 100 miles, hit a pub, drink, eat, sleep, do some exploring, and then get up, ride another 100 miles, do that for a couple weeks.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1e"><strong>How many bikes do you own?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> I&#x2019;ve got two tandems. I don&#x2019;t know the names but I just ride them. I still have a Trek TTX 9.9&#x2014;carbon fiber, high end, fairly expensive bike. It&#x2019;s a 2010. That&#x2019;s what I was racing on until I got a Felt IA. I&#x2019;ve got four bikes total.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><strong>How did you get into bike maintenance, and why now?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1h"> I don&#x2019;t want people to think this is a full-time job. In the winter I&#x2019;d go in and spend eight hours a day just learning. When I wasn&#x2019;t working or travelling I&#x2019;d like to just get out of the house. It was fun. I get a kick out of people saying, &quot;Well, he was a senator and now he&#x2019;s a bike mechanic.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1i">No, I&#x2019;m blessed. I&#x2019;m doing something that I&#x2019;ve always wanted to do. I enjoy it. Am I going to do it forever? I could. I may. The people at the shop are nice, they&#x2019;re hardworking business people, and they&#x2019;ve been very good to me.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1j"><strong>How deep are you trying to get into the inner workings of bikes?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1k"> I can take a bike out of the box, put it together A-Z. I&#x2019;m trying to learn it all.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1l"><strong>What was the learning curve like?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1m"> In the beginning it was ugly. But now I&#x2019;m helping a lot of the younger kids that are coming in. It&#x2019;s a personal satisfaction thing, nothing more.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1n"><strong>Cycling attracts a lot of politicians. Why do you think that is?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1o"> [Secretary of State] John [Kerry] and I used to ride a lot. [Sen. Rob] Portman, [Sen. Mark] Warner, Kerry, and me&#x2014;we&#x2019;d go out pretty regularly discussing politics half of the way and just riding or racing the remaining half. It&#x2019;s a good way to free your mind and get that heart pumping, find that balance that&#x2019;s sometimes lacking, clear your head and keep the stress level down.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1p"><strong>You once described Kerry as a &quot;very good athlete.&quot; What&#x2019;s it like riding with him?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1q"> He&#x2019;s a very, very good rider. Strong rider, technical rider, confident rider. We&#x2019;ve had many good rides where we&#x2019;re both pretty much at the maximum moving with the younger guys.</p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1r"><strong>Any advice to non-cyclists interested in getting on a bike?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".29insb7s5xc.1.1.0.0.4.1s"> Just do it. Go with comfort first. You don&#x2019;t need to get the most expensive bike.
