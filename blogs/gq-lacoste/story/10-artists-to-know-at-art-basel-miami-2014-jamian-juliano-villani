  	    "articleBody": "Name: Jamian Juliano-Villani\u000A\u000A Age: 27\u000A\u000A Hometown: Basking Ridge, NJ\u000A\u000A Gallery: Tanya Leighton\u000A\u000A What Shes Taking to Basel: Advil\u000A\u000A Tool(s) of Choice: Nichiban tape and a bonefolder\u000A\u000A Influencers: Mike Kelley, Patrick Caulfield\u000A\u000A Twitter Handle: @psychojonkanoo\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHow many pieces are you working on right now?\u000A\u000A A shit-load. Two are going to be at Basel and I\u0027ll make another if I have time. Then right after Basel I have a solo show in Detroit, so I have a bunch going for that.\u000A\u000AWhat do you paint with?\u000A\u000A Airbrush and paintbrush.\u000A\u000AHow do you see your work?\u000A\u000A I use a lot of references. I want to make really personal paintings, but I don\u0027t want to produce anything that\u0027s super self-indulgent. I want my paintings to work like a TV so that they\u0027re entertaining and you don\u0027t need a discourse to understand them.\u000A\u000AWhat were your references for your pieces for Basel?\u000A\u000A Do you guys mind if I smoke?\u000A\u000APlease.\u000A\u000A One is based off of a German cigarette ad from the mid-seventies. It\u0027s all these little lions and tigers moving into college and they\u0027re all smoking. I was thinking about what an awful message it was, so I made a collage of it imploding. Then, based off that, I started to paint and while I was painting I rotated the canvas. So some parts might look like glitches, but it\u0027s actually just a result of the collage.\u000A\u000AFor the second one I looked at a bunch of illustrations of mountains from the 40s. It\u0027s only half-done, but it\u0027s either going to depict the evolution of man or a mechanical deer, and then I\u0027ll be in there somewhere...stepping on a monkey while making a kissy face.\u000A\u000AWe just interviewed your boyfriend Van, do you guys feed off of each other creatively?\u000A\u000A Yes, definitely. He makes me slow down and I make him speed up.\u000A\u000AWhat are you hoping to get out of Basel?\u000A\u000A It\u0027s my first big fair, so I\u0027m nervous. But I know it will be good. I typically don\u0027t like fairs, but I think this one is good context for me because it\u0027s with Van and it\u0027s also with a gallery I respect and trust. And because it\u0027s a fair, I think my work has a better chance of being understood as more than just crazy fucked up cartoons. Everybody thinks I love cartoons, but I don\u0027t. I just like what they do because they\u0027re democratic and loveable. They\u0027re a reference someone probably wouldn\u0027t expect to find within the context of fine art.\u000A\u000AWhy should people care about art?\u000A\u000A Well they shouldn\u0027t, really. [laughter] I think it\u0027s important, but the way that art makes its entrance into the cultural arena is really pretentious and very singular. A lot of people miss out because it\u0027s in this little fucking bubble. Because the way we approach it is so academic, it\u0027s harder for people to relate. You shouldn\u0027t have to read a fucking packet to really get into it. It should just be as simple as what you like.\u000A\u000ABut it seems like you put a tremendous amount of research into everything.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s not totally random. I identify with all these paintings. For a while I would paint all through the night because I\u0027d have these awful nightmares, so I didn\u0027t want to sleep. It sounds corny, but I think sometimes it\u0027s like I\u0027m painting nightmares because they\u0027re all very dark. I think it\u0027s because I\u0027m exercising some kind of psychological internal warfare. That\u0027s what makes these paintings mine.\u000A\u000ADo you fine something therapeutic about the creative process?\u000A\u000A Yes, definitely. I might end up hating all of my paintings, but I feel good when I\u0027m doing them and that\u0027s what makes me love them. If I\u0027m working and I find the piece really disgusting, then that probably means it\u0027s going well. If I\u0027m ever unsure of something, then that\u0027s when I know I need to just go ahead and do it. I don\u0027t know if people get what I\u0027m trying to do yet, but that\u0027s fine because I have a lifetime to figure this shit out.\u000A\u000AIs that a goal of yours, to get people to understand what you\u0027re doing?\u000A\u000A That\u0027s why I leave them somewhat open-ended. They read as something very graphic and legible and then you realize something else is happening and it becomes surreal. If I can meet the viewer on some kind of middle ground, then that\u0027s great because that means they\u0027ve connected with something. It might not be the thing I was thinking about when I was painting, but it\u0027s that point of connection that\u0027s important to me.\u000A\u000AHow long does it take you to paint a piece?\u000A\u000A Each one can take a day or a couple days. Some I\u0027ll get started, but then I feel like I need to give them time, and that can mean months. So there are a bunch of pieces in my studio that are just waiting to be finished, but it\u0027s got to happen at the right time. And that\u0027s the issue: time. I feel like I always have a million ideas, but there are only so many hours in a day. Like I want to do this one for Basel of a fly giving another fly a lap dance, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll get finished.\u000A\u000ASorry?\u000A\u000A You know in porn how you\u0027ll see a girl giving a guy a blowjob, but you don\u0027t see him? Well, that got me thinking about doing a painting in fly-vision, of a fly giving a fly a lap dance. But because it\u0027s painted in this weird refracted vision you don\u0027t see the entire scenario at once. You wouldn\u0027t necessarily realize it\u0027s this really awful moment of a fly giving another fly a lap danceI like that idea.\u000A\u000AHow do you conceptualize a piece, do you sketch your paintings out?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t do any sketches. I\u0027ll take an idea then start looking for references that make sense with it and things happen from there. I don\u0027t plan at all, but then once I start using the airbrush I have to be more careful...more technical. If I mess up one detail with the airbrush, I\u0027ll have to repaint the whole thing.\u000A\u000AWhen do you know you\u0027re finished with a piece?\u000A\u000A When I start adding shit that feels unnecessary. There comes a point where I know there\u0027s enough going on and that\u0027s when I\u0027ll stop. I never want to add any gratuitous props. Things could go on forever, but you need to know where the line is.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s most rewarding for you?\u000A\u000A I like when someone looks at my work and can\u0027t immediately tell if they like it. I think that if it catches them off guard then that\u0027s good. The bad thing about my work is when someone thinks they get it right away.\u000A\u000ASo you don\u0027t think you\u0027re work should be easily consumed?\u000A\u000A Yeah, the reason why I use these things is because they are graphic images from things that I\u0027ve read. Like the one with the lions and tigers going to college, I\u0027m thinking about Italian Futurism. But it\u0027s not necessarily important for the viewer to know about that. My references are important because everyone thinks that they\u0027re making something totally new and they\u0027re not, so I try to be explicit about them. That way, I\u0027m giving them a kind of homage through re-appropriation and re-conceptualization. I think that people need to stop thinking that they\u0027re geniuses and actually look at shit that was done fifty years ago.\u000A\u000ASo it\u0027s not all about what\u0027s new, what\u0027s next?\u000A\u000A Art isn\u0027t supposed to be like fashion, it\u0027s supposed to be emotive. I think it\u0027s important to recognize that there were people who did things better than us. We can\u0027t compete with them, so don\u0027t try. You won\u0027t be able to do it better, so do something else.\u000A\u000AHow would you compare yourself now to when you first started out?\u000A\u000A When I first started out I was really into making iconic images, things that were quick reads. And I think now I\u0027m interested in slow reads, something that goes beyond the actual painting.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s the end goal?\u000A\u000A I want to do something that\u0027s generative instead of careerist. But, most importantly, something that\u0027s going to be around for a long time. To create work that\u0027s got me in it.\u000A\u000ADo you ever throw away a painting?\u000A\u000A Oh God yes. I have like fifty paintings that I don\u0027t like, but one day I plan on using them to make a giant freak flag: A freak flag of fuck-ups. But overall, I throw away probably about half of everything...could be worse.\u000A\u000AHow do you stay in the present moment?\u000A\u000A Listen to Reggae, not look at my Instagram, and chain smoke.",

her work to be like television. So she draws from TV&#39;s visual vocabulary, referencing everything from old propagandist cartoons to anime. Her paintings are acrylic, both painted and airbrushed, sometimes quick to complete and sometimes grueling. She&#39;s a night owl, a smoker, and, with a solo show coming up this February at MOCAD, unbelievably prolific</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.0"><strong>Name: Jamian Juliano-Villani</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.1"> <strong>Age: </strong>27</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.2"> <strong>Hometown: </strong>Basking Ridge, NJ</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.3"> <strong>Gallery: </strong>Tanya Leighton</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>What Shes Taking to Basel: </strong>Advil</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.6"> <strong>Tool(s) of Choice: </strong>Nichiban tape and a bonefolder</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.7"> <strong>Influencers: </strong>Mike Kelley, Patrick Caulfield</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.8"> <strong>Twitter Handle: </strong><a href="http://instagram.com/psychojonkanoo"><strong>@psychojonkanoo</strong></a></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.9"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>How many pieces are you working on right now?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.b"> A shit-load. Two are going to be at Basel and I&#x2019;ll make another if I have time. Then right after Basel I have a solo show in Detroit, so I have a bunch going for that.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>What do you paint with?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Airbrush and paintbrush.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>How do you see your work?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.f"> I use a lot of references. I want to make really personal paintings, but I don&#x2019;t want to produce anything that&#x2019;s super self-indulgent. I want my paintings to work like a TV so that they&#x2019;re entertaining and you don&#x2019;t need a discourse to understand them.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>What were your references for your pieces for Basel?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.h"> Do you guys mind if I smoke?</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>Please.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.j"> One is based off of a German cigarette ad from the mid-seventies. It&#x2019;s all these little lions and tigers moving into college and they&#x2019;re all smoking. I was thinking about what an awful message it was, so I made a collage of it imploding. Then, based off that, I started to paint and while I was painting I rotated the canvas. So some parts might look like glitches, but it&#x2019;s actually just a result of the collage.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.k">For the second one I looked at a bunch of illustrations of mountains from the 40s. It&#x2019;s only half-done, but it&#x2019;s either going to depict the evolution of man or a mechanical deer, and then I&#x2019;ll be in there somewhere...stepping on a monkey while making a kissy face.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>We just interviewed your boyfriend Van, do you guys feed off of each other creatively?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.m"> Yes, definitely. He makes me slow down and I make him speed up.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>What are you hoping to get out of Basel?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.o"> It&#x2019;s my first big fair, so I&#x2019;m nervous. But I know it will be good. I typically don&#x2019;t like fairs, but I think this one is good context for me because it&#x2019;s with Van and it&#x2019;s also with a gallery I respect and trust. And because it&#x2019;s a fair, I think my work has a better chance of being understood as more than just crazy fucked up cartoons. Everybody thinks I love cartoons, but I don&#x2019;t. I just like what they do because they&#x2019;re democratic and loveable. They&#x2019;re a reference someone probably wouldn&#x2019;t expect to find within the context of fine art.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>Why should people care about art?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.q"> Well they shouldn&#x2019;t, really. [laughter] I think it&#x2019;s important, but the way that art makes its entrance into the cultural arena is really pretentious and very singular. A lot of people miss out because it&#x2019;s in this little fucking bubble. Because the way we approach it is so academic, it&#x2019;s harder for people to relate. You shouldn&#x2019;t have to read a fucking packet to really get into it. It should just be as simple as what you like.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>But it seems like you put a tremendous amount of research into everything.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.s"> It&#x2019;s not totally random. I identify with all these paintings. For a while I would paint all through the night because I&#x2019;d have these awful nightmares, so I didn&#x2019;t want to sleep. It sounds corny, but I think sometimes it&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;m painting nightmares because they&#x2019;re all very dark. I think it&#x2019;s because I&#x2019;m exercising some kind of psychological internal warfare. That&#x2019;s what makes these paintings mine.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>Do you fine something therapeutic about the creative process?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.u"> Yes, definitely. I might end up hating all of my paintings, but I feel good when I&#x2019;m doing them and that&#x2019;s what makes me love them. If I&#x2019;m working and I find the piece really disgusting, then that probably means it&#x2019;s going well. If I&#x2019;m ever unsure of something, then that&#x2019;s when I know I need to just go ahead and do it. I don&#x2019;t know if people get what I&#x2019;m trying to do yet, but that&#x2019;s fine because I have a lifetime to figure this shit out.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>Is that a goal of yours, to get people to understand what you&#x2019;re doing?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.w"> That&#x2019;s why I leave them somewhat open-ended. They read as something very graphic and legible and then you realize something else is happening and it becomes surreal. If I can meet the viewer on some kind of middle ground, then that&#x2019;s great because that means they&#x2019;ve connected with something. It might not be the thing I was thinking about when I was painting, but it&#x2019;s that point of connection that&#x2019;s important to me.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>How long does it take you to paint a piece?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.y"> Each one can take a day or a couple days. Some I&#x2019;ll get started, but then I feel like I need to give them time, and that can mean months. So there are a bunch of pieces in my studio that are just waiting to be finished, but it&#x2019;s got to happen at the right time. And that&#x2019;s the issue: time. I feel like I always have a million ideas, but there are only so many hours in a day. Like I want to do this one for Basel of a fly giving another fly a lap dance, but I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;ll get finished.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>Sorry?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.10"> You know in porn how you&#x2019;ll see a girl giving a guy a blowjob, but you don&#x2019;t see him? Well, that got me thinking about doing a painting in fly-vision, of a fly giving a fly a lap dance. But because it&#x2019;s painted in this weird refracted vision you don&#x2019;t see the entire scenario at once. You wouldn&#x2019;t necessarily realize it&#x2019;s this really awful moment of a fly giving another fly a lap danceI like that idea.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong>How do you conceptualize a piece, do you sketch your paintings out?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.12"> I don&#x2019;t do any sketches. I&#x2019;ll take an idea then start looking for references that make sense with it and things happen from there. I don&#x2019;t plan at all, but then once I start using the airbrush I have to be more careful...more technical. If I mess up one detail with the airbrush, I&#x2019;ll have to repaint the whole thing.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>When do you know you&#x2019;re finished with a piece?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.14"> When I start adding shit that feels unnecessary. There comes a point where I know there&#x2019;s enough going on and that&#x2019;s when I&#x2019;ll stop. I never want to add any gratuitous props. Things could go on forever, but you need to know where the line is.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.15"><strong>What&#x2019;s most rewarding for you?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.16"> I like when someone looks at my work and can&#x2019;t immediately tell if they like it. I think that if it catches them off guard then that&#x2019;s good. The bad thing about my work is when someone thinks they get it right away.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.17"><strong>So you don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re work should be easily consumed?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.18"> Yeah, the reason why I use these things is because they are graphic images from things that I&#x2019;ve read. Like the one with the lions and tigers going to college, I&#x2019;m thinking about Italian Futurism. But it&#x2019;s not necessarily important for the viewer to know about that. My references are important because everyone thinks that they&#x2019;re making something totally new and they&#x2019;re not, so I try to be explicit about them. That way, I&#x2019;m giving them a kind of homage through re-appropriation and re-conceptualization. I think that people need to stop thinking that they&#x2019;re geniuses and actually look at shit that was done fifty years ago.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.19"><strong>So it&#x2019;s not all about what&#x2019;s new, what&#x2019;s next?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.1a"> Art isn&#x2019;t supposed to be like fashion, it&#x2019;s supposed to be emotive. I think it&#x2019;s important to recognize that there were people who did things better than us. We can&#x2019;t compete with them, so don&#x2019;t try. You won&#x2019;t be able to do it better, so do something else.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.1b"><strong>How would you compare yourself now to when you first started out?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.1c"> When I first started out I was really into making iconic images, things that were quick reads. And I think now I&#x2019;m interested in slow reads, something that goes beyond the actual painting.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><strong>What&#x2019;s the end goal?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> I want to do something that&#x2019;s generative instead of careerist. But, most importantly, something that&#x2019;s going to be around for a long time. To create work that&#x2019;s got me in it.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><strong>Do you ever throw away a painting?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> Oh God yes. I have like fifty paintings that I don&#x2019;t like, but one day I plan on using them to make a giant freak flag: A freak flag of fuck-ups. But overall, I throw away probably about half of everything...could be worse.</p><p data-reactid=".1wf0jf04hz4.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><strong>How do you stay in the present moment?</strong></p><p
