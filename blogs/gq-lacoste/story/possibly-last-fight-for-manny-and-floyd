  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AWe are, at last, after a near-decade of waiting, just a few days out from the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fight. For all the talk of the exorbitant price (and shocking take-home for each fighter), and the increasingly vocal hordes noting that most of this money is going to a serial batterer of women, it\u0027s important to resurface a simple, overshadowed truth about Saturday\u0027s fight: It\u0027s probably going to be great.\u000A\u000ANow, it\u0027s possible that the favored Mayweather uses his size and strength and defensive advantages to pound Pacquiao into adobo—and this thing becomes a mismatch everyone forgets about in a couple of weeks. It could happen. That\u0027s certainly the history of massive PPV events like this one, particularly in recent years. But circumstances, all told, have conspired to make this fight &amp;#x2013; this overhyped, exhaustingly overdone, morally questionable, GNP-of-a-third-world-nation, woolly mammoth of a fight &amp;#x2013; potentially terrific. With our $100, we\u0027re buying a lot on Saturday night, and it just so happens that we might luck yourself into an incredible fight, too.\u000A\u000AHere\u0027s why:\u000A\u000AThey\u0027re both so motivated. The only real knock on either one of these fighters, throughout their whole career, is that they have never faced each other. At first it was Mayweather who was thought to be ducking Pacquiao; as Manny\u0027s recent performances in the ring have grown more and more spotty, that onus has shifted in his direction. These are still two of the most popular, respected, all-time-legendary-status bors in the history of the sport, and even though both of their reputations are secure no matter what happens, the one who leaves the ring a winner has bragging rights, probably for all time. The thing about putting off a fight for so long is that when it happens, you sort of need to actually win it. If this is truly the Fight of the Century, you come into it with the danger of people forgetting how great you were for all the years before this night. These two men are already legends. A win here makes them immortal. This is particularly true for Mayweather, who places an almost unnatural, frightening importance on his undefeated record, as witnessed by his desperation to protect it at any cost for the last five years. (Mayweather hasn\u0027t just dodged Pacquiao over the last few years; he has dodged anyone who could possibly challenge him and the precious spotless record. His fights have been almost exclusively Mayweather-vs.-Some Other Guy.) If he loses that—and his reason for being—he might set himself on fire in the middle of the ring. And Pacquiao, who has slowed and is thought to have lost some motivation in the last few years, has reportedly been training like he hasn\u0027t in a decade. You\u0027ll be seeing the best either of these bors have looked in a long time.\u000A\u000AThere might actually be no sequel. One of boxing\u0027s problems in recent years, particularly in PPV bouts, is that you sometimes sense, halfway through a fight, that you\u0027re really watching an undercard for some future (more expensive) PPV fight between the same two guys. A fight is supposed to be definitive—not the pilot for an ongoing series. But that hasn\u0027t slowed the talk that this week\u0027s bout could potentially set up a rematch as soon as September—an understandable notion, considering the boatload of cash round one bringing in. Interestingly, though, in spite of the chatter, neither side is acting like they plan on saddling up again anytime soon. As David Mayo of MLive.com has pointed out there is no contract stipulation for a second fight—highly, highly unusual for a fight of this magnitude. There\u0027s just really nothing in place yet.\u000A\u000AConsidering how difficult it was to get this fight going—and considering how this is still an HBO-Showtime production, a wobbly beast neither side has ever been comfortable with—putting together round two could be even harder. If they have nothing set up for a sequel now, it\u0027s tough to see how they get it done before either fighter is too old, no matter how this fight turns out. Here\u0027s a quote from beloved Pacquiao trainer Freddie Roach:\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s really, really strange to me that Floyd didn\u0027t sign a rematch clause in his contract,\u0022 Roach said. \u0022I found that a little bit odd because that means there isn\u0027t a rematch, or if we win, and we do get a rematch, we\u0027ll be in charge of the negotiations — unless they had gotten that in the contract, and they didn\u0027t do that. So I wonder sometimes where his head\u0027s at. He\u0027s had a big career. It\u0027s got to end sometime.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis doesn\u0027t sound to me like two guys planning on setting up a rematch this fall. This sounds like two guys who are prepared to do this once, and then be done with it.\u000A\u000ASpeaking of which: May 2nd might be the last time you see either of these guys fight—and, oh yeah, these are two of the greatest fighters of all time. Both fighters have looked more run-of-the-mill over their last few fights. Pacquiao lost handily to Juan Manuel Marquez (perhaps twice, depending on how much faith you place in judges), and some even believe Marcos Maidana defeated Mayweather a year ago. This will happen when you age: I, for example, don\u0027t type as fast as I used to myself. Every bor struggles with the question of when to quit, when to recognize that the next fight might just be the one too many.\u000A\u000AThese are two enormously wealthy men who will become even more so—unfathomably so—after Saturday night. They are also both in their upper thirties. A loss doesn\u0027t destroy either one of them … but a loss after this loss might. There is every reason to believe that this could be the last fight for both Mayweather (38) and Pacquiao (36). They are considered two of the three best pound-for-pound bors in the world right now, and most observers have them in the top 50 of all time, if not higher. For better or worse, this is as good as boxing gets in the 2010s, and it\u0027s been that way for several years. It\u0027s a hundred bucks, and considering the questionable morals of the various men to whom that money is going, it will come with the requisite need for a full-body Brillo pad acid wash of your soul once it\u0027s through. But if you knew for certain that this was the last fight for either Mayweather or Pacquiao—even if you just suspected it—you\u0027d watch it. I bet you\u0027ll get your money\u0027s worth. This isn\u0027t an old Tyson circus show. I can\u0027t wait to watch. Everything else is finally over. Now comes the fun part.\u000A\u000AIt feels strange to end a preview column without making a prediction, so, here you go: Mayweather in a split decision. This is still boxing, after all. If it goes the distance, no matter who actually won, bet on the guy with the undefeated record and the greater financial incentive. Sad, I know, but hey: The fight may be terrific to watch, but that doesn\u0027t eradicate the fundamental greed rot at the center of the human condition. In the end, don\u0027t get wrapped up in a decision and which way it goes. Down that path lies madness. Just enjoy the fight itself. That\u0027s going to have to be enough.\u000A\u000AWill Leitch is a senior writer at Sports On Earth, culture writer for Bloomberg Politics, contributing editor at New York Magazine and the founder of Deadspin.

data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.1">We are, at last, after a near-decade of waiting, just a few days out from the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao fight. For all the talk of the exorbitant price (<a href="http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2015/04/-bank-millions-ppv.html">and shocking take-home for each fighter</a>), <a href="http://deadspin.com/what-the-fuck-is-wrong-with-stephen-a-smith-1700198846">and the increasingly vocal hordes</a> noting that most of this money is going to a <a href="http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2015/04/floyd-mayweather-serial-women-beater.html">serial batterer of women</a>, it&#x2019;s important to resurface a simple, overshadowed truth about Saturday&#x2019;s fight: It&#x2019;s probably going to be great.</p><p data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.2">Now, it&#x2019;s possible that the favored Mayweather uses his size and strength and defensive advantages to pound Pacquiao into <em>adobo&#x2014;</em>and this thing becomes a mismatch everyone forgets about in a couple of weeks. It could happen. That&#x2019;s certainly the history of massive PPV events like this one, particularly in recent years. But circumstances, all told, have conspired to make this fight &amp;#x2013; this overhyped, exhaustingly overdone, morally questionable, GNP-of-a-third-world-nation, woolly mammoth of a fight &amp;#x2013; potentially terrific. With our $100, we&#x2019;re buying a lot on Saturday night, and it just so happens that we might luck yourself into an incredible fight, too.</p><p data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.3">Here&#x2019;s why:</p><p data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>They&#x2019;re both so motivated. </strong>The only real knock on either one of these fighters, throughout their whole career, is that they have never faced each other. At first it was Mayweather who was thought to be ducking Pacquiao; as Manny&#x2019;s recent performances in the ring have grown more and more spotty, that onus has shifted in his direction. These are still two of the most popular, respected, all-time-legendary-status bors in the history of the sport, and even though both of their reputations are secure no matter what happens, the one who leaves the ring a winner has bragging rights, probably for all time. The thing about putting off a fight for so long is that when it happens, you sort of need to actually win it. If this is truly the Fight of the Century, you come into it with the danger of people forgetting how great you were for all the years before this night. These two men are already legends. A win here makes them immortal. This is particularly true for Mayweather, who places an almost unnatural, frightening importance on his undefeated record, as witnessed by his desperation to protect it at any cost for the last five years. (Mayweather hasn&#x2019;t just dodged Pacquiao over the last few years; he has dodged anyone who could possibly challenge him and the precious spotless record. His fights have been almost exclusively Mayweather-vs.-Some Other Guy.) If he loses that&#x2014;and his reason for being&#x2014;he might set himself on fire in the middle of the ring. And Pacquiao, who has slowed and is thought to have lost some motivation in the last few years, has reportedly been training like he hasn&#x2019;t in a decade. You&#x2019;ll be seeing the best either of these bors have looked in a long time.</p><p data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>There might actually be no sequel. </strong>One of boxing&#x2019;s problems in recent years, particularly in PPV bouts, is that you sometimes sense, halfway through a fight, that you&#x2019;re really watching an undercard for some future (more <em>expensive</em>) PPV fight between the same two guys. A fight is supposed to be <em>definitive</em>&#x2014;not the pilot for an ongoing series. But that hasn&#x2019;t slowed the talk that this week&#x2019;s bout could potentially set up a rematch as soon as September&#x2014;an understandable notion, considering the boatload of cash round one bringing in. Interestingly, though, in spite of the chatter, neither side is acting like they plan on saddling up again anytime soon. As <a href="http://www.mlive.com/mayweather/index.ssf/2015/04/column_enjoy_floyd_mayweather-.html">David Mayo of MLive.com</a> has pointed out there is no contract stipulation for a second fight&#x2014;highly, <em>highly </em>unusual for a fight of this magnitude. There&#x2019;s just really nothing in place yet.</p><p data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.7">Considering how difficult it was to get <em>this </em>fight going&#x2014;and considering how this is still an HBO-Showtime production, a wobbly beast neither side has ever been comfortable with&#x2014;putting together round two could be even harder. If they have nothing set up for a sequel now, it&#x2019;s tough to see how they get it done before either fighter is too old, no matter how this fight turns out. Here&#x2019;s a quote from beloved Pacquiao trainer Freddie Roach:</p><p data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.8"><em>&quot;It&#x2019;s really, really strange to me that Floyd didn&#x2019;t sign a rematch clause in his contract,&quot; Roach said. &quot;I found that a little bit odd because that means there isn&#x2019;t a rematch, or if we win, and we do get a rematch, we&#x2019;ll be in charge of the negotiations &#x2014; unless they had gotten that in the contract, and they didn&#x2019;t do that. So I wonder sometimes where his head&#x2019;s at. He&#x2019;s had a big career. It&#x2019;s got to end sometime.&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.9">This doesn&#x2019;t sound to me like two guys planning on setting up a rematch this fall. This sounds like two guys who are prepared to do this once, and then be done with it.</p><p data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Speaking of which: May 2nd might be the last time you see either of these guys fight&#x2014;and, oh yeah, these are two of the greatest fighters of all time. </strong>Both fighters have looked more run-of-the-mill over their last few fights. Pacquiao lost handily to Juan Manuel Marquez (perhaps twice, depending on how much faith you place in judges), and some even believe Marcos Maidana defeated Mayweather a year ago. This will happen when you age: I, for example, don&#x2019;t type as fast as I used to myself. Every bor struggles with the question of when to quit, when to recognize that the next fight might just be the one too many.</p><p data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.b">These are two enormously wealthy men who will become even more so&#x2014;unfathomably so&#x2014;after Saturday night. They are also both in their upper thirties. A loss doesn&#x2019;t destroy either one of them &#x2026; but a loss after <em>this </em>loss might. There is every reason to believe that this could be the last fight for both Mayweather (38) and Pacquiao (36). <a href="http://ringtv.craveonline.com/ratings">They are considered two of the three best pound-for-pound bors in the world right now</a>, and most observers have them in the top 50 of all time, if not higher. For better or worse, this <em>is </em>as good as boxing gets in the 2010s, and it&#x2019;s been that way for several years. It&#x2019;s a hundred bucks, and considering the questionable morals of the various men to whom that money is going, it will come with the requisite need for a full-body Brillo pad acid wash of your soul once it&#x2019;s through. But if you knew for certain that this was the last fight for either Mayweather or Pacquiao&#x2014;even if you just <em>suspected </em>it&#x2014;you&#x2019;d watch it. I bet you&#x2019;ll get your money&#x2019;s worth. This isn&#x2019;t an old Tyson circus show. I can&#x2019;t wait to watch. Everything else is finally over. Now comes the fun part.</p><p data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.c">It feels strange to end a preview column without making a prediction, so, here you go: <strong>Mayweather in a split decision. </strong>This is still boxing, after all. If it goes the distance, no matter who actually won, bet on the guy with the undefeated record and the greater financial incentive. Sad, I know, but hey: The fight may be terrific to watch, but that doesn&#x2019;t eradicate the fundamental greed rot at the center of the human condition. In the end, don&#x2019;t get wrapped up in a decision and which way it goes. Down that path lies madness. Just enjoy the fight itself. That&#x2019;s going to have to be enough.</p><p data-reactid=".10djnx7woow.1.1.0.0.4.d"><a href="http://www.gq.com/contributors/will-leitch"><em>Will Leitch</em></a> is a senior writer at Sports On Earth, culture writer for Bloomberg Politics, contributing editor at New York Magazine and the founder of Deadspin.
