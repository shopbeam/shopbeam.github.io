  	    "articleBody": "Zaid\u0027s arrest was no more than a hiccup in the investigation, another promising plotline—like espionage and adultery and Saddam before—that collapsed under the slightest weight. I\u0027d followed each development (none of which developed into much of anything) for more than eight months by the time Zaid was locked up, and I would continue to do so for almost two years after. Unsolved murders are not uncommon—there are thousands in the United States every year, for instance, and serial killers only manage to become serial killers because they get away with the ﬁrst two or ten or twenty. But you would think that quadruple homicides, particularly those involving middle-class professionals on vacation, would get sorted out fairly quickly. That scores of detectives and gendarmes hadn\u0027t managed to do so suggested either epic incompetence or criminal brilliance.\u000A\u000AI went to see Zaid last spring, in March. Reporters don\u0027t pester him much anymore, but his name had been inked into so many headlines and chyrons following his brother\u0027s murder that his reputation had fossilized. \u0022Yeah, yeah, those people on holiday,\u0022 a London cabbie remembered when I mentioned a murder in the Alps. \u0022Awful. The brother did it, right?\u0022\u000A\u000AZaid lives a couple of stations south of Waterloo, in a ﬂat walking distance from the train. He served tea and biscuits, and later we had lunch at the ﬁsh shop across the street. He was pleasant, if emotionally reserved, which he had discovered is not an advantage when police and reporters are asking about one\u0027s slaughtered family. \u0022They think I should have reacted a different way,\u0022 he said.\u000A\u000ALike, cry, maybe?\u000A\u000AHe blinked twice. \u0022I am who I am. I hate pretending.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt wasn\u0027t so awful, despite the indignity, being arrested for conspiring to kill his brother and three other people, as well as the attempted murder of a niece he adores. Zaid knew he didn\u0027t do it, and it did not appear the British police believed he was a dangerous criminal, let alone a mass murderer. The detectives who arrested him waited while he showered and shaved and dressed, and they smiled at a small joke: It would have been more convenient, Zaid told them, if they\u0027d waited a day so he could ﬁnish payroll at the golf club. They did not handcuff him, and they\u0027d parked discreetly at the end of his block, so as not to make a spectacle. They did not release his name, nor even officially conﬁrm that he\u0027d been arrested.\u000A\u000AZaid spent a single night in a surprisingly comfortable cell—\u0022it had a little button you could press if you wanted tea, like room service\u0022—and the jailers allowed him a couple of mild sedatives, as Zaid has difficulty sleeping in unfamiliar places. He was released the next morning on bail, but that was far less dramatic than it appears. In the United States, bail in such a serious crime would be set by a judge after a hearing, and it would be substantial, requiring enough cash or a big enough bond to assure the accused returned to court. In Surrey, Zaid was simply sent home with a form instructing him not to bother any potential witnesses and to continue living in his ﬂat in Chessington. He posted no surety, and he did not surrender his passport; indeed, he traveled to Borneo and Hong Kong in the fall of 2013, when his bail conditions still were in effect.\u000A\u000AFor all that, Zaid didn\u0027t know anything more about the crime or the investigation than any careful reader of the more reputable press.\u000A\u000ASo I went to France. Annecy is a pleasant train trip southeast from Paris, and the station is at the edge of the Old City, a short walk from the lake and the cafés anchored to the rims of the canals. Chevaline, where everyone got killed, is a pretty twenty-minute drive south along the lake.\u000A\u000AThere is a single main road through Chevaline, which is all a village of 207 people requires. It runs past a monument to the local boys killed in the war, and then a small church and its cemetery and, on the other side, a crumbling stone wall where a dozing cat startled at the sound of my Fiat. There is a big cattle barn at the end of the village and one last, thick pasture, and then the road climbs into the forest.\u000A\u000ASnow lingered on the Combe d\u0027Ire in late March, smears of slush and, higher up, wide patches of dirty white crusted with crystals that crunched under the tires. Tree limbs leaned into the road, crowded the pavement until, at the foot of a bridge, fallen branches blocked it completely. The only way to the top was on foot, meandering through the white noise of the river pouring over rocks and mossy boulders.\u000A\u000AIn the village hall, an ochre building marked by the war memorial, I asked the clerk if a storm had blown through recently, torn the trees, and cluttered the road.\u000A\u000ANo, she said.\u000A\u000ABut would the road be cleared?\u000A\u000AYes, she suspected it would be. Eventually. But there was no rush, she said. \u0022Practically nobody\u0022 ever drove that way.\u000A\u000AShe did not ask why I wanted to know. She did not ask if I wanted to drive up that road. She was very pleasant, but not at all curious. She had long ago tired of foreigners with notebooks asking her questions.\u000A\u000AThe Gendarmerie Nationale were no help at all. A \u0022non-communication\u0022 had been put in place on all things Chevaline, and a spokesman in Paris didn\u0027t foresee it being lifted anytime soon. That order did not apply, however, to Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud, who was happy, or at least willing, to meet. (He was also the only person close to the case willing to talk to me.) He was patient and thorough, and he answered every question or, regarding a few minor details, explained why he couldn\u0027t. And everything he told me, all of it, amounts to this: He does not know who killed those four people, or why, or even who was the target and who got in the way.\u000A\u000AThere is no reason to believe this is because of incompetence or conspiracy.\u000A\u000ASo that leaves criminal brilliance. Or a very bad person with very good luck.\u000A\u000AThe question is, which is more disturbing?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ATwo days before he was murdered, Saad al-Hilli pulled his BMW with the Bürstner camper on the hitch into Le Solitaire du Lac, a campground on the western shore of the lake. In early September, there would have been shade beneath leafed-out trees planted in a long double row stretching toward the water. In late March, the limbs are all pollarded away, and the trunks stand like gnarled gray ﬁsts poking up from the grass. A man is playing with his dog in a parking area, but no one else is around. There are no campers or tents, and the little box cottages are all empty. No one answers the bell at the office.\u000A\u000AEventually a small utility truck putters around a corner. The driver, a man with a ruddy face and gray hair and a pitchfork, gets out, walks toward us, my interpreter and me. He is not pleased.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ve never let a journalist come in,\u0022 he says, \u0022and I won\u0027t let you come in, either.\u0022\u000A\u000AYes, but this is where the al-Hillis stayed, right?\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ve never authorized the media to be here.\u0022\u000A\u000ADo you remember them?\u000A\u000AA pause. His face darkens. \u0022Yes,\u0022 he says. \u0022Unfortunately, yes.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AMore than a year after the murders, in October 2013, French authorities ﬁnally released the sketch of the motorcyclist. The risk of sending him off the grid by then seemed less disastrous than never ﬁnding him—either the key witness or the killer—at all.\u000A\u000ADozens of investigators had followed every conceivable lead. The Briton who\u0027d seen Sylvain Mollier and the motorcyclist was, brieﬂy and as a matter of course, a suspect. His name is Brett Martin, and he is a retired Royal Air Force pilot with a holiday home in Lathuile, a village south of the lake. He was on his own meandering ride that afternoon when he found the blood and the bodies.\u000A\u000AAn English family and a French cyclist are killed by a precision shooter, and the ﬁrst person on the scene is a former English military man with a home in France? What are the odds? The technicians swabbed him for gunpowder residue, and the detectives checked and rechecked his story. When Martin swore he never heard 21 gunshots ﬁred less than 200 meters from where he was pedaling, investigators conducted acoustic tests. They discovered that, indeed, between the tumble of the river and sound tending to bounce up and the human brain simply not recognizing a volley of pops in an Alpine forest as gunﬁre, Martin would not have heard anything.\u000A\u000AThe investigation plodded on. Every satellite company in Europe, Maillaud says, dug through its archive of images from September 5, 2012, and detectives studied those for any clue—tire tracks, vehicles, an unaccounted person—buried in the pixels. There were two bits of unmatched DNA on the al-Hillis\u0027 car, but a search of every known DNA database in Europe couldn\u0027t identify them. (Probably meaningless, anyway: One is a few skin cells on the front bumper, as if someone brushed against it in a parking lot, and the other, under the ﬂoor mat on the driver\u0027s side, was likely left by a detailer.) The day of the murders, more than 4,000 cell phones had pinged the nearest tower, and every one was being tracked down to identify potential witnesses or, assuming the shooter had been sloppy enough to make a call, the killer.\u000A\u000AIn February 2014, gendarmes knocked on the door of a man named Eric Devouassoux, a 48-year-old in Lathuile, whose mobile number was one of the 4,000. He sort of looked like the motorcyclist in the sketch, and in the weeks leading up to September 5, 2012, he\u0027d applied for a permit to carry a ﬁrearm and gotten sacked from his job as a policeman because of his temper. But there was nothing to connect him to Mollier or al-Hilli or put him on that road on that day. Unfortunately, though, he had a collection of guns, including some World War II–era weapons, which is neither unusual—the Haute-Savoie region was a center of the French Resistance, and heirlooms get passed down—nor illegal, as long as they\u0027re declared. His were not, and there were enough of them that he was charged with arms trafficking. (Maillaud shrugs when he explains this, which translates easily into Sucks to be Eric Devouassoux. Enough so, apparently, that Devouassoux hung up on me, too. The charges, however, were later dropped.)\u000A\u000AThe only thing possibly left outstanding, other than a motive and a killer, was a gray BMW 4x4 that might or might not exist. It was described by only one person, a different forestry worker, and one who fancies BMWs.\u000A\u000A\u0022There\u0027s an old saying,\u0022 Maillaud says. \u0022One witness is no witness.\u0022\u000A\u000AMaybe it had been there, and maybe it would turn up someday. But more months passed, then a second full year. No new clues, no new suspects. Only Zaid had been arrested, and then immediately released.\u000A\u000A\u0022We have tried everything possible,\u0022 Maillaud told reporters on the second anniversary. \u0022But perhaps we\u0027re in the presence of the perfect crime.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ASolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part OneSolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part TwoSolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part Three: The CyclistSolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part Four\u000ASolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part Five\u000ASolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part Six\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASean Flynn is a GQ correspondent.",

data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.0">Zaid&#x2019;s arrest was no more than a hiccup in the investigation, another promising plotline&#x2014;like espionage and adultery and Saddam before&#x2014;that collapsed under the slightest weight. I&#x2019;d followed each development (none of which developed into much of anything) for more than eight months by the time Zaid was locked up, and I would continue to do so for almost two years after. Unsolved murders are not uncommon&#x2014;there are thousands in the United States every year, for instance, and serial killers only manage to <em>become</em> serial killers because they get away with the &#xFB01;rst two or ten or twenty. But you would think that quadruple homicides, particularly those involving middle-class professionals on vacation, would get sorted out fairly quickly. That scores of detectives and gendarmes hadn&#x2019;t managed to do so suggested either epic incompetence or criminal brilliance.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.1">I went to see Zaid last spring, in March. Reporters don&#x2019;t pester him much anymore, but his name had been inked into so many headlines and chyrons following his brother&#x2019;s murder that his reputation had fossilized. &#x201C;Yeah, yeah, those people on holiday,&#x201D; a London cabbie remembered when I mentioned a murder in the Alps. &#x201C;Awful. The brother did it, right?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.2">Zaid lives a couple of stations south of Waterloo, in a &#xFB02;at walking distance from the train. He served tea and biscuits, and later we had lunch at the &#xFB01;sh shop across the street. He was pleasant, if emotionally reserved, which he had discovered is not an advantage when police and reporters are asking about one&#x2019;s slaughtered family. &#x201C;They think I should have reacted a different way,&#x201D; he said.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.3">Like, cry, maybe?</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.5">He blinked twice. &#x201C;I am who I am. I hate pretending.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.6">It wasn&#x2019;t so awful, despite the indignity, being arrested for conspiring to kill his brother and three other people, as well as the attempted murder of a niece he adores. Zaid knew he didn&#x2019;t do it, and it did not appear the British police believed he was a dangerous criminal, let alone a mass murderer. The detectives who arrested him waited while he showered and shaved and dressed, and they smiled at a small joke: It would have been more convenient, Zaid told them, if they&#x2019;d waited a day so he could &#xFB01;nish payroll at the golf club. They did not handcuff him, and they&#x2019;d parked discreetly at the end of his block, so as not to make a spectacle. They did not release his name, nor even officially con&#xFB01;rm that he&#x2019;d been arrested.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.7">Zaid spent a single night in a surprisingly comfortable cell&#x2014;&#x201C;it had a little button you could press if you wanted tea, like room service&#x201D;&#x2014;and the jailers allowed him a couple of mild sedatives, as Zaid has difficulty sleeping in unfamiliar places. He was released the next morning on bail, but that was far less dramatic than it appears. In the United States, bail in such a serious crime would be set by a judge after a hearing, and it would be substantial, requiring enough cash or a big enough bond to assure the accused returned to court. In Surrey, Zaid was simply sent home with a form instructing him not to bother any potential witnesses and to continue living in his &#xFB02;at in Chessington. He posted no surety, and he did not surrender his passport; indeed, he traveled to Borneo and Hong Kong in the fall of 2013, when his bail conditions still were in effect.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.8">For all that, Zaid didn&#x2019;t know anything more about the crime or the investigation than any careful reader of the more reputable press.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.9">So I went to France. Annecy is a pleasant train trip southeast from Paris, and the station is at the edge of the Old City, a short walk from the lake and the caf&#xE9;s anchored to the rims of the canals. Chevaline, where everyone got killed, is a pretty twenty-minute drive south along the lake.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.a">There is a single main road through Chevaline, which is all a village of 207 people requires. It runs past a monument to the local boys killed in the war, and then a small church and its cemetery and, on the other side, a crumbling stone wall where a dozing cat startled at the sound of my Fiat. There is a big cattle barn at the end of the village and one last, thick pasture, and then the road climbs into the forest.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.b">Snow lingered on the Combe d&#x2019;Ire in late March, smears of slush and, higher up, wide patches of dirty white crusted with crystals that crunched under the tires. Tree limbs leaned into the road, crowded the pavement until, at the foot of a bridge, fallen branches blocked it completely. The only way to the top was on foot, meandering through the white noise of the river pouring over rocks and mossy boulders.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.c">In the village hall, an ochre building marked by the war memorial, I asked the clerk if a storm had blown through recently, torn the trees, and cluttered the road.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.d">No, she said.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.e">But would the road be cleared?</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.f">Yes, she suspected it would be. Eventually. But there was no rush, she said. &#x201C;Practically nobody&#x201D; ever drove that way.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.g">She did not ask why I wanted to know. She did not ask if I wanted to drive up that road. She was very pleasant, but not at all curious. She had long ago tired of foreigners with notebooks asking her questions.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.h">The Gendarmerie Nationale were no help at all. A &#x201C;non-communication&#x201D; had been put in place on all things Chevaline, and a spokesman in Paris didn&#x2019;t foresee it being lifted anytime soon. That order did not apply, however, to Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud, who was happy, or at least willing, to meet. (He was also the only person close to the case willing to talk to me.) He was patient and thorough, and he answered every question or, regarding a few minor details, explained why he couldn&#x2019;t. And everything he told me, all of it, amounts to this: He does not know who killed those four people, or why, or even who was the target and who got in the way.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.i">There is no reason to believe this is because of incompetence or conspiracy.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.j">So that leaves criminal brilliance. Or a very bad person with very good luck.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.k">The question is, which is more disturbing?</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.l"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.m">Two days before he was murdered, Saad al-Hilli pulled his BMW with the B&#xFC;rstner camper on the hitch into Le Solitaire du Lac, a campground on the western shore of the lake. In early September, there would have been shade beneath leafed-out trees planted in a long double row stretching toward the water. In late March, the limbs are all pollarded away, and the trunks stand like gnarled gray &#xFB01;sts poking up from the grass. A man is playing with his dog in a parking area, but no one else is around. There are no campers or tents, and the little box cottages are all empty. No one answers the bell at the office.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.n">Eventually a small utility truck putters around a corner. The driver, a man with a ruddy face and gray hair and a pitchfork, gets out, walks toward us, my interpreter and me. He is not pleased.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.o">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never let a journalist come in,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;and I won&#x2019;t let you come in, either.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.p">Yes, but this is where the al-Hillis stayed, right?</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.q">&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never authorized the media to be here.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.r">Do you remember them?</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.s">A pause. His face darkens. &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Unfortunately, yes.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.t"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.u">More than a year after the murders, in October 2013, French authorities &#xFB01;nally released the sketch of the motorcyclist. The risk of sending him off the grid by then seemed less disastrous than never &#xFB01;nding him&#x2014;either the key witness or the killer&#x2014;at all.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.v">Dozens of investigators had followed every conceivable lead. The Briton who&#x2019;d seen Sylvain Mollier and the motorcyclist was, brie&#xFB02;y and as a matter of course, a suspect. His name is Brett Martin, and he is a retired Royal Air Force pilot with a holiday home in Lathuile, a village south of the lake. He was on his own meandering ride that afternoon when he found the blood and the bodies.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.w">An English family and a French cyclist are killed by a precision shooter, and the &#xFB01;rst person on the scene is a former English military man with a home in France? What are the odds? The technicians swabbed him for gunpowder residue, and the detectives checked and rechecked his story. When Martin swore he never heard 21 gunshots &#xFB01;red less than 200 meters from where he was pedaling, investigators conducted acoustic tests. They discovered that, indeed, between the tumble of the river and sound tending to bounce up and the human brain simply not recognizing a volley of pops in an Alpine forest as gun&#xFB01;re, Martin would not have heard anything.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.x">The investigation plodded on. Every satellite company in Europe, Maillaud says, dug through its archive of images from September 5, 2012, and detectives studied those for any clue&#x2014;tire tracks, vehicles, an unaccounted person&#x2014;buried in the pixels. There were two bits of unmatched DNA on the al-Hillis&#x2019; car, but a search of every known DNA database in Europe couldn&#x2019;t identify them. (Probably meaningless, anyway: One is a few skin cells on the front bumper, as if someone brushed against it in a parking lot, and the other, under the &#xFB02;oor mat on the driver&#x2019;s side, was likely left by a detailer.) The day of the murders, more than 4,000 cell phones had pinged the nearest tower, and every one was being tracked down to identify potential witnesses or, assuming the shooter had been sloppy enough to make a call, the killer.</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.y">In February 2014, gendarmes knocked on the door of a man named Eric Devouassoux, a 48-year-old in Lathuile, whose mobile number was one of the 4,000. He sort of looked like the motorcyclist in the sketch, and in the weeks leading up to September 5, 2012, he&#x2019;d applied for a permit to carry a &#xFB01;rearm <em>and</em> gotten sacked from his job as a policeman because of his temper. But there was nothing to connect him to Mollier or al-Hilli or put him on that road on that day. Unfortunately, though, he had a collection of guns, including some World War II&#x2013;era weapons, which is neither unusual&#x2014;the Haute-Savoie region was a center of the French Resistance, and heirlooms get passed down&#x2014;nor illegal, as long as they&#x2019;re declared. His were not, and there were enough of them that he was charged with arms trafficking. (Maillaud shrugs when he explains this, which translates easily into <em>Sucks to be Eric Devouassoux</em>. Enough so, apparently, that Devouassoux hung up on me, too. The charges, however, were later dropped.)</p><p data-reactid=".f1cl647hfk.1.1.0.0.4.z">The only thing possibly left outstanding, other than a motive and a killer, was a gray BMW 4x4 that might or might not exist.
