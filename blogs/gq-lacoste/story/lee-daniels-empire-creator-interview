  	    "articleBody": "Lee Daniels got a phone call this morning from one of the several people he trusts to help him manage his career and reputation, and the message, he says, was basically this: \u0022You really should be careful, you know, what you put out there.\u0022 He is aware that he has a reputation for speaking—to journalists, to studio executives, to strangers at parties—without much of a filter. So he\u0027s trying to be careful. He\u0027s 55 now, and though he\u0027s been honest, maybe to a fault, about himself, his life, and his failings ever since his second film, 2009\u0027s Precious, received six Academy Award nominations and made people curious about Lee Daniels, there are now other interested parties to consider besides himself. At the moment, as he sits at the Sunset Tower in Hollywood, miles away from his longtime New York City home, he owes Fox the first episode of the second season of his music-family drama, Empire. He\u0027s prepping his next film, a Richard Pryor biopic, starring Mike Epps. And next week he\u0027ll announce he\u0027s developing a show called Star, about a girl group trying to make it in Atlanta—a little TLC, a little Supremes, but set in the modern day, like Empire.\u000A\u000AThey told him to be careful, so he\u0027s trying, even though there are things he wants to say about television and Empire\u0027s overwhelming success that he knows he shouldn\u0027t. Put it this way, he says finally: For years, TV networks have underestimated the intelligence of the American public. They\u0027ve underestimated Lee Daniels. Like with Precious. Or Lee Daniels\u0027 The Butler, which made  $175 million. \u0022Everybody all my life has always said, ‘Oh, no one\u0027s gonna see that movie. We\u0027re not gonna make that movie.\u0027 These studios: ‘Who wants to see a movie about an obese woman?\u0027 A lot of people. We were told that The Butler was not gonna do well. We were laughed out of every studio. You know? This has changed, baby.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere are not a lot of studios laughing at Daniels now. With Empire, Daniels and his co-creator, Danny Strong, took a show about an African-American family in the music world—with the soap-opera-by-way-of-Shakespeare premise of a terminally ill executive (Terrence Howard\u0027s Lucious Lyon) dodging his ex-con ex-wife (an on-fire Taraji P. Henson) while figuring out which of his three sons (played by Trai Byers, Jussie Smollett, and Bryshere Y. Gray) will inherit his business—and discovered a massive audience the networks didn\u0027t even know existed. Ten million people watched the premiere, back in January, a startling number that was not nearly as startling as the number of people who watched the finale:  17.6 million. The population of a small European country watching a show that, despite its avalanche of gunplay and bib-assisted blow jobs, contains more blunt, complicated reality about black life—in its earnest grappling with spirituality, homophobia, and mental illness—than practically any other show on network television this century. The kind of show where people talk without first running their thoughts through a network-executive  translator—the kind of show where people say things like \u0022Bye, Felicia!\u0022 without stopping to explain what \u0022Bye, Felicia!\u0022 means.\u000A\u000A\u0022The people have been starving for this,\u0022 Henson says. \u0022Starving for this. Then it was ‘Oh, it\u0027s a black thing.\u0027 Mm-mm. You can\u0027t say that anymore! People are identifying with these people, period.\u0022\u000A\u000AEmpire more or less single-handedly saved Fox, though it was conspicuously absent on the Emmy nominations list—a couple for costumes, one for Henson, but otherwise shut out of the main event. Daniels went on Instagram and posted an entertaining tirade after that—\u0022Fuck these motherfuckers!\u0022—but he says he\u0027s not actually worrying too much about the snub. Maybe he shouldn\u0027t say this, but: \u0022Terrence Howard calls me up after, and he goes, ‘You okay?\u0027 I said, ‘Dude. You\u0027re on a fucking hit show! How much money are we fucking making? How much was your fucking paycheck last week, motherfucker?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s been at this a long time. He started in Hollywood as a casting agent back in the \u002780s. He became a producer in 2001 and pretty much immediately helped Halle Berry win the first Oscar ever to go to a black actress in a leading role, for Monster\u0027s Ball. And he\u0027s done it in his own Lee Daniels–ish way. When he decided he wanted to direct, with 2006\u0027s no-budget Shadowboxer, he cast Dame Helen Mirren as an assassin, Cuba Gooding Jr. as her loyal life partner, Stephen Dorff as a randy villain, and a zebra, for reasons that no one ever acknowledges or explains.\u000A\u000AEverything he\u0027s made—Precious, The Paperboy, The Butler, Empire—has that same strange, Technicolor glaze, that heady mix of desire and violence and sly jokes, which is to say that it\u0027s all deeply weird, like some cartoon sex dream you might not even admit to having. But in doing so, he\u0027s gradually moved from the edge of the industry all the way to the center of it. In a position of power like none he\u0027s ever had before…right?\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s true. But here\u0027s what I feel about that. The suits just change. I don\u0027t. I\u0027m the same dude. I\u0027m that same cat. I\u0027m that same cat that made the two-dollar hit Shadowboxer. I\u0027m that same dude.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou mean the suit becomes a bigger suit?\u000A\u000A\u0022No,\u0022 Lee Daniels says, grinning. Then he does the thing they told him not to do.\u000A\u000A\u0022They get replaced. I stay the same.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAnother bit of conversation that\u0027ll probably get Lee Daniels in trouble:\u000A\u000AWhat do TV networks get wrong about the intelligence of the American public?\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t have an education. But I\u0027ve never not listened to my voice. That voice has kept me alive. It\u0027s kept me away from bullets. It\u0027s kept me away from HIV. That  I don\u0027t have it is a miracle from God. It\u0027s put me where I\u0027m at right now, opposite you. I think it\u0027s God.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhy do you say that about HIV?\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027ll be 56 in December. When it first came out, all my friends died. Every one of them. Every boyfriend I had. Every friend I had. And I didn\u0027t know how to get it. We didn\u0027t know how you were getting it, whether you touched somebody, whether you… That I didn\u0027t get it is a miracle. It\u0027s a miracle.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat do you chalk that miracle up to?\u000A\u000A\u0022I have no idea. So much so that I felt that I should have died, and I threw myself into the abyss of drugs. Like, ‘Why am I here, when there are people that have better souls, that are nicer, kinder people, that are dying in my arms?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ASo your reaction to surviving was to basically become…\u000A\u000A\u0022A drug addict. And then I got over that. I use that for my work. That\u0027s gonna get me in trouble again. I don\u0027t care.\u0022 He laughs.  \u0022I don\u0027t care. Just do what you gotta do.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOne thing you realize really quickly about Lee Daniels is that it\u0027s all autobiography. Everything he makes is about himself. Which is funny, because his work tends to depict things that have never happened to anyone, ever. Like right now, say, we\u0027re watching the first episode of Empire\u0027s second season in an editing bay, and there is a person in a gorilla suit being lowered in a cage onto a stage at an ersatz Black Lives Matter rally, followed by a cavalcade of black celebrities—one cameo after another. It\u0027s like The Avengers for people who don\u0027t get to be in The Avengers. Daniels is wearing white jeans and a black Henley, and when the person in the gorilla suit removes the gorilla\u0027s head, he reaches over and grabs my shoulder. \u0022This is how we start, honey!\u0022 he yells happily. \u0022Yes, Gawd!\u0022\u000A\u000AHe stands and paces around the room, working on calibrating the precise degree of provocation in the shot. He is not unaware that it will bother people to open the season with a caged gorilla parachuting into the signal social movement of our time. He\u0027s just trying to figure out how much it will bother people. He is accustomed to being exposed, to feeling vulnerable. The central image of Empire so far was a flashback of Lucious throwing his 5-year-old high-heel-wearing son into a trash can. This is something that actually happened to Daniels: \u0022Just by putting myself out there on a limb—that is what\u0027s healing to me.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s been doing this since the beginning. Shadowboxer, despite the zebra, is a sad and longing movie about revenge and surrogate families, two things Daniels knows something about: His father, a Philadelphia police officer, was killed when Daniels was a teenager; much later, Daniels adopted his imprisoned brother\u0027s twins, whom he has since raised as his own. Precious is basically one long statement about a deeply traumatized child finding love and self-acceptance outside her home. Even The Butler, which was based on another man\u0027s story, is also about fathers and sons and the stubbornly unrecognized value of black life.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestIf there\u0027s a demon Daniels hasn\u0027t exorcised yet, it\u0027s probably because he\u0027s saving it for his next script.\u000A\u000A\u0022Me, I\u0027m messy. I\u0027m messy, messy, messy,\u0022 Daniels says. That quality is embedded in his work; often it has seemed like its signature quality—messy, messy, messy. The New York Times, reviewing Shadowboxer, wrote that the film \u0022leaves you with your mouth hanging open—partly in admiration of its audacity and partly in disbelief at its preposterousness.\u0022 Six years later, the same paper called The Paperboy, not entirely disapprovingly, \u0022a hot mess.\u0022\u000A\u000AI\u0027m reading these back to Daniels when he cuts me off.\u000A\u000A\u0022I don\u0027t want to read that. No, please don\u0027t. I don\u0027t want to do that.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe last review he says he deliberately read, back in 2005, called him a hack, and to this day, \u0022I use that line. I call myself a hack whenever I get angry at myself.\u0022\u000A\u000ADo you recognize the quality in your work that reviewer was trying to put a finger on?\u000A\u000A\u0022I think that whoever that guy is, I would imagine he\u0027s probably a white man. He hasn\u0027t walked in my shoes. So he doesn\u0027t know, or he hasn\u0027t smelled the inside of a trash can. So his perspective on life is a completely different perspective. And I respect that he don\u0027t respect it. Check. Next! Don\u0027t tell me that again. I hate that. I hate that.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat I read it, or that he said it?\u000A\u000A\u0022That he said it. And both.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe turns his attention back to the edit. \u0022Fuck me. Why is she—\u0022 Daniels says to his editor. On the screen, we gaze at one of the show\u0027s couples, engaged in some improbable physical contact. \u0022Would she be rubbing sweat on his chest?\u0022\u000A\u000AThe question seems rhetorical and the editor treats it as such.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m not going to worry about it—it\u0027s TV,\u0022 Daniels says finally. \u0022Fuck it! Keep it moving, baby! Lee Daniels, you\u0027re a hack!\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AOne side effect of Empire\u0027s success is that Daniels is often called upon to speak on behalf of African-Americans in his industry—a responsibility he says he relishes. But it can lead to some discordant moments. Earlier this year, The Hollywood Reporter held a roundtable discussion with several writer-producers, including Daniels, House of Cards\u0027 Beau Willimon, Damon Lindelof, and others; the subject of writers\u0027-room diversity came up, and Daniels found himself polling his fellow creators on how many African-American writers they had on their shows. Things got tense; Willimon told Daniels it was a \u0022weird question.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen I bring this episode up with Daniels, he says diplomatically about Willimon: \u0022He had his right to argue that.\u0022 But then he continues: \u0022My experience watching TV since I was a child—that I\u0027m watching white people write the black experience—is offensive to me. And I\u0027m sorry that you\u0027re offended that I\u0027m offended!\u0022\u000A\u000AWhen the person in the gorilla suit at the Black Lives Matter rally removes the gorilla\u0027s head, Daniels\u000Areaches over and grabs my shoulder. \u0022This is how we start, honey!\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000APeople seemed mad at you for asking.\u000A\u000A\u0022What does that say to you? I can\u0027t even talk about it again, because then I\u0027ll get upset again. I just don\u0027t—I\u0027m trying to understand what that means.\u0022\u000A\u000AI think it means that people feel like they\u0027re being accused of something they don\u0027t want to be accused of.\u000A\u000A\u0022But are they guilty of it?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADaniels\u0027s honesty is so seemingly total and endearing that it can take a while to realize that he\u0027s not in fact telling you everything. There is a reason that Daniels holds back parts of his life, and the reason—beyond the obvious human impulse toward self-protection—tends to be that he has yet to mine those parts for a movie or a TV show. For instance: In the Lee Daniels legend, he came to Hollywood with a couple of dollars in his pocket, started a nursing agency that made him a very wealthy man, then sold it and joined the industry with a couple-million-dollar head start.\u000A\u000AThis is true. He\u0027d been working as a receptionist at an agency, thought he could do better, and did—by his mid-twenties, he had hundreds of people working for him. But it\u0027s also true that his success in Los Angeles was not nearly as immediate as he has sometimes suggested. He tells me, begrudgingly, that he was homeless. He says he was directing  theater at a church. And then he stops himself. \u0022I ain\u0027t gonna talk about it with you, but I did what I had to do. It was a rough time.\u0022 Daniels pauses. He describes Star, the girl-group show he\u0027s making: \u0022The lead girl is white, hot, she looks like Anna Nicole Smith but she sings like Amy Winehouse. She\u0027s a little trashy, and she will do anything it takes to get to the top.\u0022 The show, he says, is about \u0022what you will do to get to what it is that you got to get to. I\u0027ve never talked about it. But I\u0027m gonna explore it with Star.\u0022\u000A\u000ADaniels says that one reason he was drawn to making a film about Richard Pryor—which he\u0027s shooting in 2016 with Epps, Oprah Winfrey, and Kate Hudson—is because he and Pryor have so much in common: \u0022the concept of being true to your art, and also the whole concept of the freebase, the crack pipe—my addiction to cocaine and crack during that time, and understanding him on a very primal level, and understanding why he did it.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo, Daniels says, \u0022I gotta do Richard Pryor to get that hump off my back, man. It\u0027s the one last thing that I just gotta get out there and shake it, shake the soul. It\u0027s like shaking your underwear out. It\u0027s taking a bath and just like scrubbing your skin from the memory.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADaniels says he heals himself through the work. Family and friends, though, are more complicated for him—conversations he can have in front of millions are often conversations he\u0027s unable to have at home, even with his own adopted children. \u0022My son is 19 years old, and he\u0027s just finding out that he\u0027s black. He\u0027s struggling right now. I did everything I could to my kids to put them on the Upper West Side, in fancy-ass schools. Because I want them to have what  I didn\u0027t have. Now he\u0027s thrown into the abyss, as a black man, and he knows now, and he\u0027s got a chip on his shoulder with me.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhy?\u000A\u000A\u0022Because I wasn\u0027t honest with him when we were on 74th and Amsterdam as taxis were driving by and not picking us up, and water splashing on us as they go down and pick up the white family. He couldn\u0027t understand why. I didn\u0027t want to have that conversation. It was too fucking ugly.\u0022\u000A\u000ADaniels is aware of the irony. \u0022Dude, as honest as I try to be, I couldn\u0027t be that honest with my kids.\u0022\u000A\u000AOr he could be, but only through the medium of a TV show. Hakeem, Empire\u0027s spoiled princeling, being forced to grow up—that\u0027s how Lee Daniels is able to be honest. \u0022Everything that\u0027s up there is my relationship with my kid,\u0022 Daniels says. The show is how he talks to the people he loves.\u000A\u000AAnd lately, Daniels says, they\u0027ve begun to talk back. He recently got a letter from his brother. The same brother who in 1996, according to Daniels, left two kids on their mother\u0027s doorstep, unable to raise them because he was in a prison cell—kids that Daniels would come to love and raise as his own. The same brother, says Daniels, who declined to speak to him for much of his life, on account of his sexual orientation.\u000A\u000ABut \u0022he sent me a letter from prison recently,\u0022 Daniels says. In it, \u0022he says: ‘I\u0027m sorry for hating you just because.\u0027 All these years. He\u0027s been in jail, in and out of jail since he\u0027s been twentyish. ‘I\u0027m sorry for hating you just because.\u0027 Because I was gay.\u0022\u000A\u000AWhat do you think prompted that letter?\u000A\u000A\u0022He\u0027s probably the king over there, in  the prison that he\u0027s at. He said they all shut down when Empire comes on. Like, that shit gets silent! You know, don\u0027t come  near the TV. They have to hear it, because there\u0027s no rewind. I mean: That was more important to me than getting a nomination for an Academy Award. For him to tell me that…‘I\u0027m sorry for hating you all these years just because.\u0027 For him to understand that through the work—because of the work!\u0022\u000A\u000AThe first season\u0027s finale, when Terrence Howard\u0027s character embraces his son…\u000A\u000A\u0022Dream.\u0022 Then he sings: \u0022Dream on!\u0022\u000A\u000AIs that something you had hoped for?\u000A\u000A\u0022I think my dad would be blown away by the success of it all. And that demands respect.\u0022 Daniels pauses, then tells a story about his father—the elder Daniels was driving once, in West Philadelphia, when…\u000A\u000AActually, Daniels decides, he\u0027s saving that one, too. \u0022I\u0027m gonna put that in, I think. In a flashback.

co-creator of the sublimely preposterous smash hit <em>Empire</em>, and the man bringing Richard Pryor’s life to the big screen. But who is Lee Daniels? Just watch his movies, watch his show—it’s all in there, even the ugliest parts</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.0"><strong>Lee Daniels</strong> got a phone call this morning from one of the several people he trusts to help him manage his career and reputation, and the message, he says, was basically this: &#x201C;You really should be careful, you know, what you put out there.&#x201D; He is aware that he has a reputation for speaking&#x2014;to journalists, to studio executives, to strangers at parties&#x2014;without much of a filter. So he&#x2019;s trying to be careful. He&#x2019;s 55 now, and though he&#x2019;s been honest, maybe to a fault, about himself, his life, and his failings ever since his second film, 2009&#x2019;s <em>Precious,</em> received six Academy Award nominations and made people curious about Lee Daniels, there are now other interested parties to consider besides himself. At the moment, as he sits at the Sunset Tower in Hollywood, miles away from his longtime New York City home, he owes Fox the first episode of the second season of his music-family drama, <em>Empire.</em> He&#x2019;s prepping his next film, a Richard Pryor biopic, starring Mike Epps. And next week he&#x2019;ll announce he&#x2019;s developing a show called <em>Star,</em> about a girl group trying to make it in Atlanta&#x2014;a little TLC, a little Supremes, but set in the modern day, like <em>Empire.</em></p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1">They told him to be careful, so he&#x2019;s trying, even though there are things he wants to say about television and <em>Empire&#x2019;</em>s overwhelming success that he knows he shouldn&#x2019;t. Put it this way, he says finally: For years, TV networks have underestimated the intelligence of the American public. They&#x2019;ve underestimated Lee Daniels. Like with <em>Precious.</em> Or <em>Lee Daniels&#x2019; The Butler,</em> which made &#x2028;$175 million. &#x201C;Everybody all my life has always said, &#x2018;Oh, no one&#x2019;s gonna see that movie. We&#x2019;re not gonna make that movie.&#x2019; These studios: &#x2018;Who wants to see a movie about an obese woman?&#x2019; A lot of people. We were told that <em>The Butler</em> was not gonna do well. We were laughed out of every studio. You know? This has <em>changed,</em> baby.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.2">There are not a lot of studios laughing at Daniels now. With <em>Empire,</em> Daniels and his co-creator, Danny Strong, took a show about an African-American family in the music world&#x2014;with the soap-opera-by-way-of-Shakespeare premise of a terminally ill executive (Terrence Howard&#x2019;s Lucious Lyon) dodging his ex-con ex-wife (an on-fire Taraji P. Henson) while figuring out which of his three sons (played by Trai Byers, Jussie Smollett, and Bryshere Y. Gray) will inherit his business&#x2014;and discovered a massive audience the networks didn&#x2019;t even know existed. Ten million people watched the premiere, back in January, a startling number that was not nearly as startling as the number of people who watched the finale: &#x2028;17.6 million. The population of a small European country watching a show that, despite its avalanche of gunplay and bib-assisted blow jobs, contains more blunt, complicated reality about black life&#x2014;in its earnest grappling with spirituality, homophobia, and mental illness&#x2014;than practically any other show on network television this century. The kind of show where people talk without first running their thoughts through a network-executive &#x2028;translator&#x2014;the kind of show where people say things like &#x201C;Bye, Felicia!&#x201D; without stopping to explain what &#x201C;Bye, Felicia!&#x201D; means.</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.3">&#x201C;The people have been starving for this,&#x201D; Henson says. &#x201C;<em>Starving</em> for this. Then it was &#x2018;Oh, it&#x2019;s a black thing.&#x2019; <em>Mm-mm.</em> You can&#x2019;t say that anymore! People are identifying with these people, period.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.5"><em>Empire</em> more or less single-handedly saved Fox, though it was conspicuously absent on the Emmy nominations list&#x2014;a couple for costumes, one for Henson, but otherwise shut out of the main event. Daniels went on Instagram and posted an entertaining tirade after that&#x2014;&#x201C;Fuck these motherfuckers!&#x201D;&#x2014;but he says he&#x2019;s not actually worrying too much about the snub. Maybe he shouldn&#x2019;t say this, but: &#x201C;Terrence Howard calls me up after, and he goes, &#x2018;You okay?&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;Dude. You&#x2019;re on a fucking hit show! How much money are we fucking making? How much was your fucking paycheck last week, motherfucker?&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.6">He&#x2019;s been at this a long time. He started in Hollywood as a casting agent back in the &#x2019;80s. He became a producer in 2001 and pretty much immediately helped Halle Berry win the first Oscar ever to go to a black actress in a leading role, for <em>Monster&#x2019;s Ball.</em> And he&#x2019;s done it in his own Lee Daniels&#x2013;ish way. When he decided he wanted to direct, with 2006&#x2019;s no-budget <em>Shadowboxer,</em> he cast Dame Helen Mirren as an assassin, Cuba Gooding Jr. as her loyal life partner, Stephen Dorff as a randy villain, and a zebra, for reasons that no one ever acknowledges or explains.</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.7">Everything he&#x2019;s made&#x2014;<em>Precious, The Paperboy, The Butler, Empire</em>&#x2014;has that same strange, Technicolor glaze, that heady mix of desire and violence and sly jokes, which is to say that it&#x2019;s all deeply weird, like some cartoon sex dream you might not even admit to having. But in doing so, he&#x2019;s gradually moved from the edge of the industry all the way to the center of it.

Everything he makes is about himself. Which is funny, because his work tends to depict things that have never happened to anyone, ever. Like right now, say, we&#x2019;re watching the first episode of <em>Empire&#x2019;</em>s second season in an editing bay, and there is a person in a gorilla suit being lowered in a cage onto a stage at an ersatz Black Lives Matter rally, followed by a cavalcade of black celebrities&#x2014;one cameo after another. It&#x2019;s like <em>The Avengers</em> for people who don&#x2019;t get to be in <em>The Avengers.</em> Daniels is wearing white jeans and a black Henley, and when the person in the gorilla suit removes the gorilla&#x2019;s head, he reaches over and grabs my shoulder. &#x201C;This is how we start, honey!&#x201D; he yells happily. &#x201C;Yes, Gawd!&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.o">He stands and paces around the room, working on calibrating the precise degree of provocation in the shot. He is not unaware that it will bother people to open the season with a caged gorilla parachuting into the signal social movement of our time. He&#x2019;s just trying to figure out <em>how much</em> it will bother people. He is accustomed to being exposed, to feeling vulnerable. The central image of <em>Empire</em> so far was a flashback of Lucious throwing his 5-year-old high-heel-wearing son into a trash can. This is something that actually happened to Daniels: &#x201C;Just by putting myself out there on a limb&#x2014;that is what&#x2019;s healing to me.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.p">He&#x2019;s been doing this since the beginning. <em>Shadowboxer,</em> despite the zebra, is a sad and longing movie about revenge and surrogate families, two things Daniels knows something about: His father, a Philadelphia police officer, was killed when Daniels was a teenager; much later, Daniels adopted his imprisoned brother&#x2019;s twins, whom he has since raised as his own. <em>Precious</em> is basically one long statement about a deeply traumatized child finding love and self-acceptance outside her home. Even <em>The Butler,</em> which was based on another man&#x2019;s story, is also about fathers and sons and the stubbornly unrecognized value of black life.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.q"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55f99c4cb031e5832b064819/master/w_600/lee-daniels-gq-2015-02.jpg" alt="lee-daniels-gq-2015-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flee-daniels-empire-creator-interview&amp;t=lee-daniels-gq-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flee-daniels-empire-creator-interview&amp;t=lee-daniels-gq-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flee-daniels-empire-creator-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f99c4cb031e5832b064819%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flee-daniels-gq-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=lee-daniels-gq-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Flee-daniels-empire-creator-interview&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f99c4cb031e5832b064819%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Flee-daniels-gq-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=lee-daniels-gq-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><span class="caption-text"><p>If there&#x2019;s a demon Daniels hasn&#x2019;t exorcised yet, it&apos;s probably because he&apos;s saving it for his next script.</p></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.r">&#x201C;Me, I&#x2019;m messy. I&#x2019;m messy, messy, messy,&#x201D; Daniels says. That quality is embedded in his work; often it has seemed like its signature quality&#x2014;messy, messy, messy. <em>The New York Times,</em> reviewing <em>Shadowboxer,</em> wrote that the film &#x201C;leaves you with your mouth hanging open&#x2014;partly in admiration of its audacity and partly in disbelief at its preposterousness.&#x201D; Six years later, the same paper called <em>The Paperboy,</em> not entirely disapprovingly, &#x201C;a hot mess.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.s">I&#x2019;m reading these back to Daniels when he cuts me off.</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.t">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to read that.

I call myself a hack whenever I get angry at myself.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.v"><em>Do you recognize the quality in your work that reviewer was trying to put a finger on?</em></p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.w">&#x201C;I think that whoever that guy is, I would imagine he&#x2019;s probably a white man. He hasn&#x2019;t walked in my shoes. So he doesn&#x2019;t know, or he hasn&#x2019;t smelled the inside of a trash can. So his perspective on life is a completely different perspective. And I respect that he don&#x2019;t respect it. Check. Next! Don&#x2019;t tell me that again. I hate that.

Keep it moving, baby! Lee Daniels, you&#x2019;re a hack!&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.12"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>One side effect</strong> of <em>Empire&#x2019;</em>s success is that Daniels is often called upon to speak on behalf of African-Americans in his industry&#x2014;a responsibility he says he relishes. But it can lead to some discordant moments. Earlier this year, <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> held a roundtable discussion with several writer-producers, including Daniels, <em>House of Cards&#x2019;</em> Beau Willimon, Damon Lindelof, and others; the subject of writers&#x2019;-room diversity came up, and Daniels found himself polling his fellow creators on how many African-American writers they had on their shows. Things got tense; Willimon told Daniels it was a &#x201C;weird question.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.14">When I bring this episode up with Daniels, he says diplomatically about Willimon: &#x201C;He had his right to argue that.&#x201D; But then he continues: &#x201C;My experience watching TV since I was a child&#x2014;that I&#x2019;m watching white people write the black experience&#x2014;is offensive to me.

There is a reason that Daniels holds back parts of his life, and the reason&#x2014;beyond the obvious human impulse toward self-protection&#x2014;tends to be that he has yet to mine those parts for a movie or a TV show. For instance: In the Lee Daniels legend, he came to Hollywood with a couple of dollars in his pocket, started a nursing agency that made him a very wealthy man, then sold it and joined the industry with a couple-million-dollar head start.</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1c">This is true. He&#x2019;d been working as a receptionist at an agency, thought he could do better, and did&#x2014;by his mid-twenties, he had hundreds of people working for him. But it&#x2019;s also true that his success in Los Angeles was not nearly as immediate as he has sometimes suggested. He tells me, begrudgingly, that he was homeless. He says he was directing &#x2028;theater at a church. And then he stops himself. &#x201C;I ain&#x2019;t gonna talk about it with you, but I did what I had to do. It was a rough time.&#x201D; Daniels pauses. He describes <em>Star,</em> the girl-group show he&#x2019;s making: &#x201C;The lead girl is white, hot, she looks like Anna Nicole Smith but she sings like Amy Winehouse. She&#x2019;s a little trashy, and she will do <em>anything</em> it takes to get to the top.&#x201D; The show, he says, is about &#x201C;what you will do to get to what it is that you got to get to. I&#x2019;ve never talked about it. But I&#x2019;m gonna explore it with <em>Star.</em>&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1d">Daniels says that one reason he was drawn to making a film about Richard Pryor&#x2014;which he&#x2019;s shooting in 2016 with Epps, Oprah Winfrey, and Kate Hudson&#x2014;is because he and Pryor have so much in common: &#x201C;the concept of being true to your art, and also the whole concept of the freebase, the crack pipe&#x2014;my addiction to cocaine and crack during that time, and understanding him on a very primal level, and understanding why he did it.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1e">So, Daniels says, &#x201C;I gotta do Richard Pryor to get that hump off my back, man. It&#x2019;s the one last thing that I just gotta get out there and shake it, shake the soul. It&#x2019;s like shaking your underwear out. It&#x2019;s taking a bath and just like scrubbing your skin from the memory.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1f"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1g"><strong>Daniels says</strong> he heals himself through the work. Family and friends, though, are more complicated for him&#x2014;conversations he can have in front of millions are often conversations he&#x2019;s unable to have at home, even with his own adopted children. &#x201C;My son is 19 years old, and he&#x2019;s just finding out that he&#x2019;s black. He&#x2019;s struggling right now. I did everything I could to my kids to put them on the Upper West Side, in fancy-ass schools. Because I want them to have what &#x2028;I didn&#x2019;t have. Now he&#x2019;s thrown into the abyss, as a black man, and he knows now, and he&#x2019;s got a chip on his shoulder with me.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1h"><em>Why?</em></p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1i">&#x201C;Because I wasn&#x2019;t honest with him when we were on 74th and Amsterdam as taxis were driving by and not picking us up, and water splashing on us as they go down and pick up the white family. He couldn&#x2019;t understand why. I didn&#x2019;t want to have that conversation. It was too fucking ugly.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1j">Daniels is aware of the irony. &#x201C;Dude, as honest as I try to be, I couldn&#x2019;t be that honest with my kids.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1k">Or he could be, but only through the medium of a TV show. Hakeem, <em>Empire&#x2019;</em>s spoiled princeling, being forced to grow up&#x2014;that&#x2019;s how Lee Daniels is able to be honest. &#x201C;Everything that&#x2019;s up there is my relationship with my kid,&#x201D; Daniels says. The show is how he talks to the people he loves.</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1l">And lately, Daniels says, they&#x2019;ve begun to talk back. He recently got a letter from his brother. The same brother who in 1996, according to Daniels, left two kids on their mother&#x2019;s doorstep, unable to raise them because he was in a prison cell&#x2014;kids that Daniels would come to love and raise as his own. The same brother, says Daniels, who declined to speak to him for much of his life, on account of his sexual orientation.</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1m">But &#x201C;he sent me a letter from prison recently,&#x201D; Daniels says. In it, &#x201C;he says: &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry for hating you just because.&#x2019; All these years. He&#x2019;s been in jail, in and out of jail since he&#x2019;s been twentyish. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry for hating you just because.&#x2019; Because I was gay.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1n"><em>What do you think prompted that letter?</em></p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1o">&#x201C;He&#x2019;s probably the king over there, in &#x2028;the prison that he&#x2019;s at. He said they all shut down when <em>Empire</em> comes on. Like, that shit gets silent! You know, don&#x2019;t come &#x2028;near the TV. They have to hear it, because there&#x2019;s no rewind. I mean: That was more important to me than getting a nomination for an Academy Award. For him to tell me that&#x2026;&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry for hating you all these years just because.&#x2019; For him to understand that through the work&#x2014;<em>because</em> of the work!&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1p"><em>The first season&#x2019;s finale, when Terrence Howard&#x2019;s character embraces his son&#x2026;</em></p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1q">&#x201C;Dream.&#x201D; Then he sings: &#x201C;Dream on!&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1r"><em>Is that something you had hoped for?</em></p><p data-reactid=".c6j3xmfklc.1.1.0.0.4.1s">&#x201C;I think my dad would be blown away by the success of it all.
