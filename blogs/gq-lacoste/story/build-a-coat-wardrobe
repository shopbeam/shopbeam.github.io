Here\u0027s your guide to building the perfect wardrobe of jackets, coats, and warm as hell layers\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ATier 1:\u000A\u000AThese are your heavy-hitters. Before you start building up your coat wardrobe, make sure you\u0027ve invested in at least one, if not both of these.\u000A\u000AThe Warm As F*** Coat: You may be facing some harsh elements come winter and you want to be prepared. That\u0027s when your warm AF survival gear comes in handy. A down jacket that will protect you from the harsh wind, unforgiving snow, and bitter cold of winter is invaluable. You\u0027ll be thanking us when you see that dude who blew all his cash on a leather jacket before thinking of the season ahead.\u000A\u000AThe All-Powerful Topcoat: A topcoat is basically the most hardworking item of clothing a man can buy. It\u0027s warm (especially when layered with a vest or denim jacket), it makes your jeans and T-shirt look cool and sophisticated, yet was made to wear with your finest suit. No man\u0027s wardrobe is complete without it. \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ATier 2:\u000A\u000AWith your warmth, style, and comfort taken care of by the power players of the first tier, you can start to stretch your outerwear muscles a little. This is where you can really have some fun.\u000A\u000AThe Classic Trench Coat: Leather may not be your thing. May we suggest a trench coat? It\u0027s a timeless hallmark of style, that\u0027s got the bonus of being completely functional in the rain. Go classic here, and make like you\u0027re a movie star from the 40s. And remember, it doesn\u0027t have to be raining for you to wear it, just the threat of rain (or clouds) is enough. \u000A\u000AThe Sexy Moto Jacket: Looking for instant sex appeal? Then go for the leather moto jacket, which gives you mojo you never even knew you had. The weight of leather varies, so just be sure you\u0027re getting what you need to keep you comfortable. Go for a lined jacket if you want to wear it past October. \u000A\u000AThe Talented Denim Jacket: Still not convinced, then consider the denim jacket. It\u0027s light, easy, and just as classic as its tier members. Put it on when it\u0027s a little breezy, or layer it underneath your heavier coats for an extra layer of warmth. It\u0027s a jacket of many talents.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ATier 3:\u000A\u000AThese jackets are the icing on your outerwear cake, so to speak. You\u0027ve got the basics down, you\u0027ve layered in a few extra pieces, and now you\u0027re ready to finish it off. Some of these will be pulling double duty on things you may have already picked up, but the point here is to give you some variety in the day-to-day. \u000A\u000AThe Light Spring Jacket: You may raise your eyebrow a littleâ€”after all, it\u0027s meant for warmer days. But, a nice layer of cotton (preferably in a military green) will match with any shirt you own and be a welcome addition on for those mornings where the temperature is struggling to hover around 60 degrees. \u000A\u000AThe Tough as Nails Shearling: It\u0027s as warm as your beloved puffer jacket, but comes with a little bit more style (okay, fine, a lot more). You\u0027ll be toasty all winter long, but be warned: A good shearling does not come cheap nor is it maintenance free. \u000A\u000AThe Big-Ass Duffle Coat: Consider this guy a cousin of the top coat. It\u0027s got the same kind of silhouette, just with a few styling differences. For starters, it has a hood, which if nothing else, will make you feel like a stylish version of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Secondly, duffle coats usually have toggles, a nod to their old school and high-class heritage.\u000A\u000AThe Versatile Bomber: A classic bomber is as versatile a jacket as you can get. It\u0027s in the same family as the bringing-sexy-back leather moto, but has a little more of a retro vibe to it. At the end of the day, you know it\u0027s a safe bet because it makes you feel like an extra in Top Gun. (You\u0027re not Tom Cruise, and unfortunately, you never will be.) These days, you can get it in anything from velvet (Kanye\u0027s preference) to suede (Gosling\u0027s preference).\u000A\u000AThe Non-Varsity Varsity Jacket: Once upon a time, you had to prove your athletic prowess to get a varsity jacket that meant something. Now, thanks to style gods like Mark Ronson (pictured in Saint Laurent), you just have to be willing to fork over some cash. Finally, whatever ghosts you\u0027ve been hanging on to from high school can be banished.",

No man&#x2019;s wardrobe is complete without it. </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.7"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55f833bbb031e5832b063392/master/w_806/tier2.jpg" alt="tier2.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbuild-a-coat-wardrobe&amp;t=tier2.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbuild-a-coat-wardrobe&amp;t=tier2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbuild-a-coat-wardrobe&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f833bbb031e5832b063392%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftier2.jpg&amp;description=tier2.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbuild-a-coat-wardrobe&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f833bbb031e5832b063392%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftier2.jpg&amp;description=tier2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.8"><h2>Tier 2:</h2></div><p data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.9">With your warmth, style, and comfort taken care of by the power players of the first tier, you can start to stretch your outerwear muscles a little. This is where you can really have some fun.</p><p data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>The Classic Trench Coat:</strong> Leather may not be your thing. May we suggest a trench coat? It&#x2019;s a timeless hallmark of style, that&#x2019;s got the bonus of being completely functional in the rain. Go classic here, and make like you&#x2019;re a movie star from the 40s. And remember, it doesn&#x2019;t have to be raining for you to wear it, just the threat of rain (or clouds) is enough. </p><p data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>The Sexy Moto Jacket:</strong> Looking for instant sex appeal? Then go for the leather moto jacket, which gives you mojo you never even knew you had. The weight of leather varies, so just be sure you&#x2019;re getting what you need to keep you comfortable. Go for a lined jacket if you want to wear it past October. </p><p data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>The Talented Denim Jacket:</strong> Still not convinced, then consider the denim jacket. It&#x2019;s light, easy, and just as classic as its tier members. Put it on when it&#x2019;s a little breezy, or layer it underneath your heavier coats for an extra layer of warmth. It&#x2019;s a jacket of many talents.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.d"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55f83384b031e5832b063382/master/w_806/tier3-v2.jpg" alt="tier3-v2.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbuild-a-coat-wardrobe&amp;t=tier3-v2.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbuild-a-coat-wardrobe&amp;t=tier3-v2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbuild-a-coat-wardrobe&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f83384b031e5832b063382%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftier3-v2.jpg&amp;description=tier3-v2.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbuild-a-coat-wardrobe&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f83384b031e5832b063382%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftier3-v2.jpg&amp;description=tier3-v2.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed h2" data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.e"><h2>Tier 3:</h2></div><p data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.f">These jackets are the icing on your outerwear cake, so to speak. You&#x2019;ve got the basics down, you&#x2019;ve layered in a few extra pieces, and now you&#x2019;re ready to finish it off. Some of these will be pulling double duty on things you may have already picked up, but the point here is to give you some variety in the day-to-day. </p><p data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>The Light Spring Jacket:</strong> You may raise your eyebrow a little&#x2014;after all, it&#x2019;s meant for warmer days. But, a nice layer of cotton (preferably in a military green) will match with any shirt you own and be a welcome addition on for those mornings where the temperature is struggling to hover around 60 degrees. </p><p data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>The Tough as Nails Shearling:</strong> It&#x2019;s as warm as your beloved puffer jacket, but comes with a little bit more style (okay, fine, a lot more). You&#x2019;ll be toasty all winter long, but be warned: A good shearling does not come cheap nor is it maintenance free. </p><p data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>The Big-Ass Duffle Coat:</strong> Consider this guy a cousin of the top coat. It&#x2019;s got the same kind of silhouette, just with a few styling differences. For starters, it has a hood, which if nothing else, will make you feel like a stylish version of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Secondly, duffle coats usually have toggles, a nod to their old school and high-class heritage.</p><p data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>The Versatile Bomber:</strong> A classic bomber is as versatile a jacket as you can get. It&#x2019;s in the same family as the bringing-sexy-back leather moto, but has a little more of a retro vibe to it. At the end of the day, you know it&#x2019;s a safe bet because it makes you feel like an extra in <em>Top Gun</em>. (You&#x2019;re not Tom Cruise, and unfortunately, you never will be.) These days, you can get it in anything from velvet (Kanye&#x2019;s preference) to suede (Gosling&#x2019;s preference).</p><p data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>The Non-Varsity Varsity Jacket:</strong> Once upon a time, you had to prove your athletic prowess to get a varsity jacket that meant something. Now, thanks to style gods like Mark Ronson (pictured in Saint Laurent), you just have to be willing to fork over some cash. Finally, whatever ghosts you&#x2019;ve been hanging on to from high school can be banished.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".2brdtz58y68.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
