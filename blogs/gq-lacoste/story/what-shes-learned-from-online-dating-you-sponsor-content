I\u0027m older now, of course. Wiser, too, at least in theory. But I\u0027m still single. Still looking. Still open-minded but skeptical, frustrated but amused. Though I\u0027m no expert, being a part of the romantic rat race since \u002708 has earned me a few tricks along the way. And you should read them, because chances are, you\u0027ll see yourself somewhere in the good, the bad and the ugly of my digital dating experience. And maybe, just maybe, reading my perspective will help you navigate your next relationship.",

  	    "articleBody": "Written by Millie Kerr, Illustration by Arthur Mount\u000A\u000AGive the Good Ones the Benefit of the Doubt\u000A\u000AI was fresh out of law school and working all hours of the night in a foreign country when I joined Match.com. The year was 2008—I was only 27—and no one was talking about online dating. But long and unpredictable hours at the law firm precluded me from meeting guys organically. How could I flirt with dudes in bars if I never left the office before 3 a.m.?\u000A\u000AMy early experience on Match was such a novelty to my roommates that they routinely ordered me to connect my laptop to our big-screen TV so they could live vicariously through my dating journey. To their dismay, I was selective about the matches I chose to meet in person. But after a few weeks of running super-specific searches using keywords like \u0022Seinfeld,\u0022 \u0022cheetahs\u0022 and \u0022tacos,\u0022 I got a message from an adorable Spaniard named Mario who worked in finance. We met for dinner, and I knew from the first drink that we had potential. We gorged on tapas, drank one too many sangrias, and spent the last hour chatting in Spanish. When Mario walked me to the tube station, he kissed me goodbye and said he\u0027d be in touch. Then, he promptly followed up with a text, saying that he wanted to see me again. \u000A\u000AI giddily told my friends about my crush, but days passed without another word. My friends gave me that \u0022Sorry, but it\u0027s time to move on\u0022 look, but I was certain something had gone awry. \u000A\u000ARight before I met Mario, the financial collapse of \u002708 hit. London was experiencing a professional bloodbath, friends got laid off on a daily basis, and some expats immediately returned to their native countries. It was totally plausible that Mario had been laid off and sent home to Spain, I swore to my friends, and he must have stored his Match.com info and my number on his work phone. He must\u0027ve! The situation turned into a massive joke, with my friends accusing me of fantastical, even narcissistic, thinking. Mario just wasn\u0027t that into me, they said. This wasn\u0027t the \u0022Sex and the City\u0022 episode where Miranda gets stood up because her date dies.  \u000A\u000AThe following week, a new message appeared in my Facebook inbox, and it was from Mario! Just as I\u0027d hypothesized, he\u0027d been laid off … the day after our date. He\u0027d already returned to Spain, where he was looking for a new job, but wanted to say that he\u0027d had a wonderful time, and had he remained in London he would\u0027ve asked me out again.\u000A\u000ADon\u0027t Forget That It\u0027s All Relative\u000A\u000ANo longer a joke, my story morphed into a hope-producing urban legend among my single friends. But time—and a whole lot of dates—have proven that for every Mario there are hundreds of guys who ghost without explanation. I\u0027ve had my share of cringe-worthy dates, too: the cute Brit who began spouting Communist ideologies after a few pints; the teetotaling vegan named Discovery who took me to a juice bar for \u0022a light bite;\u0022 and the good-natured but eager dude who sent me a Facebook friend request during our date. But I\u0027ve never been stood up. Or catfished. And I don\u0027t identify with the recent Vanity Fair article painting dating apps as mere vehicles for random sex (then again, I\u0027m not a millennial living in NYC). My worst relationship experiences involve people I met organically, and the All-Time Worst Boyfriend Award goes to a grad school ex.\u000A\u000AMy average luck doesn\u0027t preclude me from fearing the worst, however. Especially since friends have suffered gut-wrenching blows: There\u0027s the one whose date spotted her in the bar, only to promptly turn around and leave as she watched. Or the one whose online match called it after five minutes of chatting. \u0022Sorry,\u0022 he offered, \u0022but I\u0027m just not feeling it.\u0022\u000A\u000AThese experiences keep me open-minded but skeptical; annoyed but amused. I know finding love through online outlets is possible—I\u0027m attending a Match wedding in a few months—but I don\u0027t have the patience or stamina for searching 24/7. Some of my friends go on multiple Hinge/Match/Tinder dates a week, but I can\u0027t \u0022zombie date,\u0022 as one friend calls it. Even when I\u0027m active I only go online once a day, and I take weeks—sometimes months—off from the game. I know my limits: If I\u0027m worn down or feeling overly pessimistic, it\u0027s better to conserve energy sitting on the sidelines. Besides, no one wants to go out with a wounded warrior who can barely feign a smile.\u000A\u000ADo Some Recon\u000A\u000AI\u0027d taken an extended pause (the good kind) when I encountered an intriguing Tinder profile about a month ago. The guy was adorable—shaggy brown hair, big brown eyes, great smile—and a fellow lawyer-turned-creative professional. As you now know, I\u0027m a sucker for foreign guys. Tom (we\u0027ll call him) from Scotland (we\u0027ll say) and I met for brunch the following day and got along so well, noon turned to 4 p.m. in the blink of an eye. He\u0027d just moved to Austin, and I was moving away weeks later, but our connection demanded exploration. We started hanging out every night, and though I knew a long-term relationship was out of the question, I quickly developed strong feelings for him. \u000A\u000AOne night he suggested we cook dinner at my house. When I told a friend about our plan, she asked if I knew his last name. No, I answered. We met on Tinder, but I know what he\u0027s all about, I explained. She shot me a look—the same one my friends gave when I suggested the Spaniard had been laid off. Fearing that I\u0027d allow a complete stranger into my house (as was the plan), she urged me to check him out first. I begrudgingly texted Tom to get his last name and didn\u0027t conceal my intentions. When I got home a few hours later I ran the Google search. Tom was precisely who he said he was, at least professionally. But my stomach dropped when I found his Facebook profile, which said he was in a relationship.  \u000A\u000AI gave him the benefit of the doubt—and a chance to explain. The circumstances that brought him to the states already hinted at a breakup … maybe it ended recently, and he just hadn\u0027t changed his status yet?\u000A\u000AI canceled our cooking date but suggested we meet for an after-dinner drink instead. As soon as we sat down, Tom asked about my web search: Did I find anything interesting? He must\u0027ve forgotten about his Facebook status because he seemed genuinely surprised when I mentioned it. He\u0027d just ended a serious relationship, he said, but didn\u0027t want to hurt his ex by changing his status too quickly. I believed Tom.\u000A\u000AA few days later, he announced that he was leaving Austin: He was going to try to mend things with his ex. I didn\u0027t storm out of the bar. I did thank myself for doing my homework. A simple online search had helped set my expectations, leaving me open to the best-case scenario—and prepared for the worst. I was glad I gave him that chance to explain. And when we parted ways, I didn\u0027t feel duped by Tom. I appreciated his honesty and the fact that he said goodbye in person versus leaving without a trace. Tom, I feel certain, was one of the good ones.",

started browsing profiles seven years ago. Non-commitment is the new status quo, apps have displaced websites and emojis now constitute conversation. Digital dating used to be taboo—the sort of thing you’d only cop to during a game of Twenty Questions or seven shots into a night out with your best bros—but now we can’t imagine a world without it. 

<p>So, how have I changed? I’m older now, of course. Wiser, too, at least in theory. But I’m still single. Still looking. Still open-minded but skeptical, frustrated but amused. Though I’m no expert, being a part of the romantic rat race since ’08 has earned me a few tricks along the way. And you should read them, because chances are, you’ll see yourself somewhere in the good, the bad and the ugly of my digital dating experience. And maybe, just maybe, reading my perspective will help you navigate your next relationship.     </p></h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.0">Written by Millie Kerr, Illustration by Arthur Mount</p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.1"><strong>Give the Good Ones the Benefit of the Doubt</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.2">I was fresh out of law school and working all hours of the night in a foreign country when I joined Match.com. The year was 2008&#x2014;I was only 27&#x2014;and no one was talking about online dating. But long and unpredictable hours at the law firm precluded me from meeting guys organically. How could I flirt with dudes in bars if I never left the office before 3 a.m.?</p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.3">My early experience on Match was such a novelty to my roommates that they routinely ordered me to connect my laptop to our big-screen TV so they could live vicariously through my dating journey. To their dismay, I was selective about the matches I chose to meet in person. But after a few weeks of running super-specific searches using keywords like &#x201C;Seinfeld,&#x201D; &#x201C;cheetahs&#x201D; and &#x201C;tacos,&#x201D; I got a message from an adorable Spaniard named Mario who worked in finance. We met for dinner, and I knew from the first drink that we had potential. We gorged on tapas, drank one too many sangrias, and spent the last hour chatting in Spanish. When Mario walked me to the tube station, he kissed me goodbye and said he&#x2019;d be in touch. Then, he promptly followed up with a text, saying that he wanted to see me again. </p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.5">I giddily told my friends about my crush, but days passed without another word. My friends gave me that &#x201C;Sorry, but it&#x2019;s time to move on&#x201D; look, but I was certain something had gone awry. </p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.6">Right before I met Mario, the financial collapse of &#x2019;08 hit. London was experiencing a professional bloodbath, friends got laid off on a daily basis, and some expats immediately returned to their native countries. It was totally plausible that Mario had been laid off and sent home to Spain, I swore to my friends, and he <em>must</em> have stored his Match.com info and my number on his work phone. He must&#x2019;ve! The situation turned into a massive joke, with my friends accusing me of fantastical, even narcissistic, thinking. Mario just wasn&#x2019;t that into me, they said. This wasn&#x2019;t the &#x201C;Sex and the City&#x201D; episode where Miranda gets stood up because her date dies.  </p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.7">The following week, a new message appeared in my Facebook inbox, and it was from Mario! Just as I&#x2019;d hypothesized, he&#x2019;d been laid off &#x2026; the day after our date. He&#x2019;d already returned to Spain, where he was looking for a new job, but wanted to say that he&#x2019;d had a wonderful time, and had he remained in London he would&#x2019;ve asked me out again.</p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Don&#x2019;t Forget That It&#x2019;s All Relative</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.9">No longer a joke, my story morphed into a hope-producing urban legend among my single friends. But time&#x2014;and a whole lot of dates&#x2014;have proven that for every Mario there are hundreds of guys who ghost without explanation. I&#x2019;ve had my share of cringe-worthy dates, too: the cute Brit who began spouting Communist ideologies after a few pints; the teetotaling vegan named Discovery who took me to a juice bar for &#x201C;a light bite;&#x201D; and the good-natured but eager dude who sent me a Facebook friend request during our date. But I&#x2019;ve never been stood up. Or catfished. And I don&#x2019;t identify with the recent <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/08/tinder-hook-up-culture-end-of-dating">Vanity Fair article</a> painting dating apps as mere vehicles for random sex (then again, I&#x2019;m not a millennial living in NYC). My worst relationship experiences involve people I met organically, and the All-Time Worst Boyfriend Award goes to a grad school ex.</p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.a">My average luck doesn&#x2019;t preclude me from fearing the worst, however. Especially since friends have suffered gut-wrenching blows: There&#x2019;s the one whose date spotted her in the bar, only to promptly turn around and leave as she watched. Or the one whose online match called it after five minutes of chatting. &#x201C;Sorry,&#x201D; he offered, &#x201C;but I&#x2019;m just not feeling it.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.b">These experiences keep me open-minded but skeptical; annoyed but amused. I know finding love through online outlets is possible&#x2014;I&#x2019;m attending a Match wedding in a few months&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t have the patience or stamina for searching 24/7. Some of my friends go on multiple Hinge/Match/Tinder dates a week, but I can&#x2019;t &#x201C;zombie date,&#x201D; as one friend calls it. Even when I&#x2019;m active I only go online once a day, and I take weeks&#x2014;sometimes months&#x2014;off from the game. I know my limits: If I&#x2019;m worn down or feeling overly pessimistic, it&#x2019;s better to conserve energy sitting on the sidelines. Besides, no one wants to go out with a wounded warrior who can barely feign a smile.</p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Do Some Recon</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.d">I&#x2019;d taken an extended pause (the good kind) when I encountered an intriguing Tinder profile about a month ago. The guy was adorable&#x2014;shaggy brown hair, big brown eyes, great smile&#x2014;and a fellow lawyer-turned-creative professional. As you now know, I&#x2019;m a sucker for foreign guys. Tom (we&#x2019;ll call him) from Scotland (we&#x2019;ll say) and I met for brunch the following day and got along so well, noon turned to 4 p.m. in the blink of an eye. He&#x2019;d just moved to Austin, and I was moving away weeks later, but our connection demanded exploration. We started hanging out every night, and though I knew a long-term relationship was out of the question, I quickly developed strong feelings for him. </p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.e">One night he suggested we cook dinner at my house. When I told a friend about our plan, she asked if I knew his last name. No, I answered. We met on Tinder, but I know what he&#x2019;s all about, I explained. She shot me a look&#x2014;the same one my friends gave when I suggested the Spaniard had been laid off. Fearing that I&#x2019;d allow a complete stranger into my house (as was the plan), she urged me to <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/theres-a-reason-you-might-be-addicted-to-social-media">check him out first</a>. I begrudgingly texted Tom to get his last name and didn&#x2019;t conceal my intentions. When I got home a few hours later I ran the Google search. Tom was precisely who he said he was, at least professionally. But my stomach dropped when I found his Facebook profile, which said he was in a relationship.  </p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.f">I gave him the benefit of the doubt&#x2014;and a chance to explain. The circumstances that brought him to the states already hinted at a breakup &#x2026; maybe it ended recently, and he just hadn&#x2019;t changed his status yet?</p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.g">I canceled our cooking date but suggested we meet for an after-dinner drink instead. As soon as we sat down, Tom asked about my web search: Did I find anything interesting? He must&#x2019;ve forgotten about his Facebook status because he seemed genuinely surprised when I mentioned it. He&#x2019;d just ended a serious relationship, he said, but didn&#x2019;t want to hurt his ex by changing his status too quickly. I believed Tom.</p><p data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.4.h">A few days later, he announced that he was leaving Austin: He was going to try to mend things with his ex. I didn&#x2019;t storm out of the bar. I <em>did</em> thank myself for doing my homework. A simple online search had helped set my expectations, leaving me open to the best-case scenario&#x2014;and prepared for the worst. I was glad I gave him that chance to explain. And when we parted ways, I didn&#x2019;t feel duped by Tom. I appreciated his honesty and the fact that he said goodbye in person versus leaving without a trace. Tom, I feel certain, was one of the good ones. </p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".2d1y69otvcw.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
