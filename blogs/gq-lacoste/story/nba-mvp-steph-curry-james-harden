  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ANo other sport\u0027s MVP award means as much—historically, spiritually, reputationally—the NBA\u0027s MVP award. When was the last time you argued over the NFL\u0027s MVP award? Did you even know they have one? But with the NBA, it\u0027s an annual debate, and it starts so preposterously early. Here at GQ we\u0027ve been having this battle since the All Star break, and since then, so many names have joined what used to be (and maybe, if we\u0027re being really real, still is) a two-man fight.\u000A\u000A Since day one of the season, it\u0027s been Steph Curry vs. James Harden…until LeBron resurrected the Cavs… Russell Westbrook started putting up triple-doubles every night… CP3 somehow focused the Clips while Blake Griffin was out… and Anthony Davis quietly laid claim to the entire goddam league for the next decade. So who gets the trophy? Let\u0027s fight/thoughtfully discuss!\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ABethlehem Shoals: Meet the Golden State Warriors! They\u0027ve been at the top of the standings since the season started; their 64-15 record has made Steve Kerr is the most successful rookie coach in NBA history. The proverbial \u0022best player on the best team\u0022 is Stephen Curry, who on the year is averaging 23.6 points, 7.7 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game. He sinks nearly half of his shots from field (.482, to be exact), hits threes like they\u0027re twos, and pulls off ball-handling feats that leave you blank with astonishment. The Warriors have trampled the rest of the league and Curry has been a nightly phenom. Yet somehow, some people still doubt them in the playoffs. And somehow, Curry—an amazing individual performer whose style of play spaces the floor and sets up the bigs for Golden State— is not the consensus MVP. Instead, we\u0027re in the middle of one of the most heated, and complex, races ever.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADevin Gordon: I love Steph. I\u0027ve loved Steph for a long, long time. I went to Duke (sorry) and he went to Davidson, so we played him every November and he was just as fun then as he is now. So why do I keep trying to come up with reasons to give the MVP to someone else? He\u0027s almost certainly going to win it, for exactly the reasons Shoals laid out: best player, best team. But in a race as close as this one, that second part feels to me like it should weirdly count against him. Doesn\u0027t the fact that Steph\u0027s team is easily the best suggest that on some level, he actually hasn\u0027t been as valuable as his rivals? Golden State starts the best one through ten in the league; take away their number one, and two through ten still get the Warriors into the playoffs.\u000A\u000ASince this MVP conversation has become a three-person debate—Steph, James Harden and, on the fringe but still inside these em-dashes, Russell Westbrook—let\u0027s start with three guys no one is talking about: Chris Paul, Anthony Davis and transcendent basketball demi-god (yawn) LeBron James. Neither Davis nor LeBron had to carry their teams through a major injury to a key supporting player, but Davis doesn\u0027t even have a key supporting player, and the Cavs were a lottery team the day before LeBron arrived. Paul, meanwhile, somehow made his team better while Blake Griffin was out with his zombie-blood-infected elbow. I bet they don\u0027t get five first-place votes between them.\u000A\u000AThen there\u0027s Russ Westbrook, who has racked up so many triple-doubles since January 1 I\u0027ve lost count. It\u0027s a lot. Has anyone ever had a season like this guy? People say things like that a lot, so forgive, but Russ\u0027s season has been his most bonkers, most metaphorically Westbrook-iest season yet. And he\u0027s done it while bulldozing the Thunder through the emotional carnage of losing Kevin Durant not once but three times, the last time for good. Losing Serge Ibaka too made me laugh when it happened, as if the basketball gods were clowning Russ, seeing how much he could bear and still get OKC into the playoffs.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAnd right there is where the Russ case breaks down: If OKC misses the playoffs, he doesn\u0027t get the MVP award—he gets Willem Dafoe\u0027s Oscar for Platoon.\u000A\u000AAnd last: James Harden. Here\u0027s a guy I\u0027ve never taken fully seriously for MVP, and I can\u0027t figure out why. I know Bethlehem has a theory, and I\u0027d love to hear it, because I\u0027m running out of excuses for ignoring him. Is it because I think Houston is a playoff fraud? Doesn\u0027t that just prove the point? The Rockets might wind up with the 2 seed, in the deepest conference I can remember, and Harden will have pulled it off even though his second-best teammate for most of the season was Trevor Ariza. How is THAT not this season\u0027s MVP performance?\u000A\u000AMaybe by the end of this I\u0027ll know what I actually think.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AMyles Brown: If anything, I take Harden\u0027s candidacy too seriously. It has nothing to do with his persona, his unrepentant nut-punching, nor that near antiquated cooking dance which also belongs more to Curry than anyone. It\u0027s about history.\u000A\u000AThe MVP has always belonged to transformational players; those who expand the limits of possibility in ways that not only lift all ships in their armada, but change the tide itself. Curry\u0027s unrivaled sleight of hand shifts schemes seeking to escape a seemingly endless wave of three pointers, which is why he consistently draws up to three defenders above the arc. Harden is more interested in drawing fouls.\u000A\u000AGranted, he draws them effectively, having led the league two of the past three years. But far too often they appear to be the sole purpose of his efforts rather than a product of them. The Rockets strength is in valuing efficiency, but exploiting these loopholes feels like the opposite. It\u0027s sluggish. It\u0027s weak. It\u0027s lazy. It defines him even more than his porous defense of years past. It shouldn\u0027t be what defines an MVP.\u000A\u000AThis award isn\u0027t just for who is most valuable to their team. It\u0027s for who is most valuable to the league itself. Both Steph and Harden are those players. But only one will actually improve the game.\u000A\u000ABethlehem Shoals: Not to beat a dead drum here (I guess no drum is ever really living anyway, is it?) but Kevin Durant was absolutely right about the role of narrative in MVP voting. It\u0027s the first sign that rational cases for the award lead to overlap and clutter—something has to cut through the noise. And if for most of the year, we\u0027ve been shouting \u0022hooray for Steph and his Warriors,\u0022 I think now that \u0022Really? Does it have to be Harden?\u0022 has become its own anti-narrative. We now have to wriggle away from his strong case in order to keep the good vibes alive.\u000A\u000AIf you go with Devin\u0027s argument that the Warriors have so much support that Steph\u0027s role is diminished, then Harden might be the guy. On paper, he\u0027s doing more than anyone with very little support in a way that doesn\u0027t come off as irresponsible or selfish. Whether through scoring or playmaking, he\u0027s responsible for a higher percentage of his team\u0027s offense than anyone else in the league. And unlike with Westbrook, you never feel like he\u0027s drowning anyone else out. I can argue all day that the Warriors rely heavily on Curry for their identity but without Harden the Rockets are barren. I also can\u0027t help but point out, though, that Harden is the focal point of the team while Curry actually creates a team around him.\u000A\u000ABut for some reason, no one wants to vote for him, or feels compelled to admit they would do so grudgingly. That\u0027s too strong: Apathy and resignation are also part of the equation. But as the season wraps up, it\u0027s gotten more difficult to ignore Harden. Defeating him is as important as someone else winning. Part of it has to do with all that\u0027s cold and analytic about the Rockets—and definitely, a vote for Harden comes from the head, not the heart—but as Myles said, there\u0027s also just the creeping sense that there\u0027s something unsavory or unfair about the way Harden plays. Harden, for all his creativity and off-court charisma, makes us groan in dismay. He\u0027s not even really a heel, just an unappealing player. His constant trips to the line, which have become both punchline and qualifier when really they\u0027re just smart basketball, aren\u0027t even the problem. Rather, they\u0027re symptomatic of a larger malaise around Harden.\u000A\u000AIf Myles is right that this is a vote about the future of the NBA, I\u0027ll go even further and say that it\u0027s about our relationship with the sport. Do we want to fall in love every night as we do via Curry or be prodded into acceptance and appreciation like with Harden? That\u0027s also why I\u0027d say that Davis and Westbrook continue to capture the imagination and hang around in the conversation despite their dark horse standing. As the league goes through a transitional period, we\u0027re on the verge of asserting that there\u0027s way more to the league (and our consumption of it) than sheer performance. In Curry\u0027s case, best player on best team also has a feel-good, get-them-up-out-their-seats quality to it. We like seeing the Warriors win. We like seeing him push them. We are ourselves better because of them because it proves that there is joy in sports.\u000A\u000ADevin Gordon: OK, OK—you guys have sold me. I\u0027m scratching James Harden off my list. I knew there was an undercurrent of disdain for him out there, but I had no idea it was a goddam Rio Grande. And maybe I\u0027m just being a hack for privileging my affection for his magnificent beard, droll wit and mellifluous singing voice over his foul-hoarding, nut-shotting, on-the-court histrionics. That being said, isn\u0027t a slashing guard supposed to get to the foul line? There\u0027s something airy and unfair to me about slagging the guy for being preternaturally gifted at his job—it\u0027s privileging aesthetics over pure performance and trying to graft onto an argument about morality. (I also just can\u0027t reconcile Harden as a cold, calculating basketball machine with my general sense of him as an odd duck in a superstar\u0027s body.) That said, I also accept Myles\u0027s MVP criteria: that there\u0027s a difference between a playing style that helps a team rack up wins and a transcendent, arc-of-history-bending style that advances the cause of basketball in the free world. So OK, James Harden, you\u0027re out.\u000A\u000ABut I\u0027m having a harder time letting go completely of the more conventional definition of an MVP: indispensability. Curry\u0027s great season has come with the lowest stakes: Golden State is a playoff team with or without him—his existence means that they\u0027ll just make a deeper run. Probably a much deeper run. For OKC, though, Westbrook is the difference between a possible postseason trip and outright disaster. Ditto for Anthony Davis. Maybe the MVP should go to the guy whose team grabs that last playoff spot?\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThis is a regular season award, after all. And there\u0027s no bigger fault line in sports than the one separating teams that make the playoffs from the ones who don\u0027t.\u000A\u000AMyles Brown: The goal of every team should be to win a championship. So that is the value to be examined, no? Davis and Westbrook have clearly established themselves as unprecedented talents and true transformational players. Yet in a league where more than half the teams advance to the playoffs, how much of an accomplishment is seven extra games before summer vacation? It\u0027s certainly not to be ignored, but the need to recognize them shouldn\u0027t rearrange our priorities.\u000A\u000AThese won\u0027t be the first players whose singular brilliance has gone unrecognized. Harden wouldn\u0027t be the first to lose for a lack of likability either. Their numbers are historic, but as Shoals noted, if history has taught us anything, it\u0027s that this award is a popularity contest, subject to the whims of a cruel and fickle public. Magic lost because he got his coach fired. Isaiah lost because he was a Bad Boy. Jordan lost because we got bored. Kobe lost because we got mad. Chris Paul lost because it was Kobe\u0027s turn. LeBron lost because we got mad, now he\u0027ll lose again because we got bored. Every year, the voting booth is littered with the ashes of excellence. But are we discussing what an MVP is or what it should be?\u000A\u000AThis year\u0027s race is particularly compelling due to so many archetypes arising simultaneously, yet after sifting through them, we still arrive at Devin\u0027s issue of indispensability. It is paramount; there\u0027s a distinct difference between leading the team and being the team. However, it would be misleading to think that\u0027s the case with our frontrunners in Curry and Harden. If the only mustered argument against Curry is that his team is too good, then there is no argument. Lest we forget, Golden State spent last summer ditching their coach and dangling their second best player as trade bait. This isn\u0027t a team of perennial All-Stars and future Hall of Famers. They\u0027re a cohesive unit who thrive in their respective roles thanks to Curry. He leads with unselfishness and finishes games with fearlessness. For a team that has dominated both standings and statistics, perhaps the most telling number is their 15.7 point differential with Curry off the court. Ignoring this in favor of another great on a lesser team would be declaring the most valuable circumstances, not the most valuable player.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AThe whole point of this discussion, though, wasn\u0027t just to debate the award but to get inside the debate about the award. What\u0027s becoming clear is that arguments for or against players are less important than the players themselves. Looking at the list of past winners, what jumps out is that playing well or winning games was never enough to get the MVP. Players had to bring something more to the table; they had to prove, as Myles said, that they were leaving their stamp on the sport, if only for the year. Having a neatly-packaged story for voters isn\u0027t as important as having resonance within the basketball community.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAt the risk of sounding vague, the MVP is a gut award. It says, in pretty simple terms, who this year have we given the most fucks about, who we fucked with the most, who has done the most to make this season so (fucking) memorable. By this logic, Westbrook goes from longshot to runner-up. But at the end of the day, only one player has been appointment viewing all season long. Only one guy has been changing the way we thought a championship team could be organized. And only one of these six candidates has been on the tip of our tongues since the first few games of the year. That\u0027s Stephen Curry. If you don\u0027t agree, then we\u0027re not even debating the same trophy.\u000A\u000ADevin Gordon: Does this mean it\u0027s too late to bring up LaMarcus Aldridge?",

sport&#x2019;s MVP award means as much&#x2014;historically, spiritually, reputationally&#x2014;the NBA&#x2019;s MVP award. When was the last time you argued over the NFL&#x2019;s MVP award? Did you even know they have one? But with the NBA, it&#x2019;s an annual debate, and it starts so preposterously early. Here at <em>GQ</em> we&#x2019;ve been having this battle since the All Star break, and since then, so many names have joined what used to be (and maybe, if we&#x2019;re being really real, still is) a two-man fight.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.2"> Since day one of the season, it&#x2019;s been Steph Curry vs. James Harden&#x2026;until LeBron resurrected the Cavs&#x2026; Russell Westbrook started putting up triple-doubles every night&#x2026; CP3 somehow focused the Clips while Blake Griffin was out&#x2026; and Anthony Davis quietly laid claim to the entire goddam league for the next decade. So who gets the trophy? Let&#x2019;s fight/thoughtfully discuss!</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.3"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Bethlehem Shoals:</strong> Meet the Golden State Warriors! They&#x2019;ve been at the top of the standings since the season started; their 64-15 record has made Steve Kerr is the most successful rookie coach in NBA history. The proverbial &quot;best player on the best team&quot; is <strong>Stephen Curry,</strong> who on the year is averaging 23.6 points, 7.7 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game. He sinks nearly half of his shots from field (.482, to be exact), hits threes like they&#x2019;re twos, and pulls off ball-handling feats that leave you blank with astonishment. The Warriors have trampled the rest of the league and Curry has been a nightly phenom. Yet somehow, some people still doubt them in the playoffs. And somehow, Curry&#x2014;an amazing individual performer whose style of play spaces the floor and sets up the bigs for Golden State&#x2014; is not the consensus MVP. Instead, we&#x2019;re in the middle of one of the most heated, and complex, races ever.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.6"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55828f4ce52bc4b477a98d48/master/w_768/blogs-the-feed-steph-curry.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-steph-curry.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-steph-curry.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-steph-curry.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828f4ce52bc4b477a98d48%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-steph-curry.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-steph-curry.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828f4ce52bc4b477a98d48%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-steph-curry.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-steph-curry.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Devin Gordon:</strong> I love Steph. I&#x2019;ve loved Steph for a long, long time. I went to Duke (sorry) and he went to Davidson, so we played him every November and he was just as fun then as he is now. So why do I keep trying to come up with reasons to give the MVP to someone else? He&#x2019;s almost certainly going to win it, for exactly the reasons Shoals laid out: best player, best team. But in a race as close as this one, that second part feels to me like it should weirdly count against him. Doesn&#x2019;t the fact that Steph&#x2019;s team is easily the best suggest that on some level, he actually hasn&#x2019;t been as valuable as his rivals? Golden State starts the best one through ten in the league; take away their number one, and two through ten still get the Warriors into the playoffs.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.8">Since this MVP conversation has become a three-person debate&#x2014;Steph, <strong>James Harden</strong> and, on the fringe but still inside these em-dashes, <strong>Russell Westbrook</strong>&#x2014;let&#x2019;s start with three guys no one is talking about: <strong>Chris Paul, Anthony Davis</strong> and transcendent basketball demi-god (yawn) <strong>LeBron James</strong>. Neither Davis nor LeBron had to carry their teams through a major injury to a key supporting player, but Davis doesn&#x2019;t even have a key supporting player, and the Cavs were a lottery team the day before LeBron arrived. Paul, meanwhile, somehow made his team better while Blake Griffin was out with his zombie-blood-infected elbow. I bet they don&#x2019;t get five first-place votes between them.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.9">Then there&#x2019;s Russ Westbrook, who has racked up so many triple-doubles since January 1 I&#x2019;ve lost count. It&#x2019;s a lot. Has anyone ever had a season like this guy? People say things like that a lot, so forgive, but Russ&#x2019;s season has been his most bonkers, most metaphorically Westbrook-iest season yet. And he&#x2019;s done it while bulldozing the Thunder through the emotional carnage of losing Kevin Durant not once but three times, the last time for good. Losing Serge Ibaka too made me laugh when it happened, as if the basketball gods were clowning Russ, seeing how much he could bear and still get OKC into the playoffs.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.a"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55828f4c1177d66d68d53b55/master/w_768/blogs-the-feed-russell-westbrook.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-russell-westbrook.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-russell-westbrook.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-russell-westbrook.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828f4c1177d66d68d53b55%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-russell-westbrook.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-russell-westbrook.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828f4c1177d66d68d53b55%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-russell-westbrook.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-russell-westbrook.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.b">And right there is where the Russ case breaks down: If OKC misses the playoffs, he doesn&#x2019;t get the MVP award&#x2014;he gets Willem Dafoe&#x2019;s Oscar for <em>Platoon</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.c">And last: James Harden.

Doesn&#x2019;t that just prove the point? The Rockets might wind up with the 2 seed, in the deepest conference I can remember, and Harden will have pulled it off even though his second-best teammate for most of the season was Trevor Ariza.

It has nothing to do with his persona, his unrepentant nut-punching, nor that near antiquated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjU7BYcJwIw">cooking dance which also belongs more to Curry than anyone.</a> It&#x2019;s about history.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.g">The MVP has always belonged to transformational players; those who expand the limits of possibility in ways that not only lift all ships in their armada, but change the tide itself. Curry&#x2019;s unrivaled sleight of hand shifts schemes seeking to escape a seemingly endless wave of three pointers, which is why he consistently draws up to three defenders above the arc. Harden is more interested in drawing fouls.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.h">Granted, he draws them effectively, having led the league two of the past three years. But far too often they appear to be the sole purpose of his efforts rather than a product of them. The Rockets strength is in valuing efficiency, but exploiting these loopholes feels like the opposite. It&#x2019;s sluggish. It&#x2019;s weak. It&#x2019;s lazy. It defines him even more than his porous defense of years past. It shouldn&#x2019;t be what defines an MVP.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.i">This award isn&#x2019;t just for who is most valuable to their team. It&#x2019;s for who is most valuable to the league itself. Both Steph and Harden are those players. But only one will actually improve the game.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>Bethlehem Shoals:</strong> Not to beat a dead drum here (I guess no drum is ever really living anyway, is it?) but Kevin Durant was absolutely right about the role of narrative in MVP voting. It&#x2019;s the first sign that rational cases for the award lead to overlap and clutter&#x2014;something has to cut through the noise. And if for most of the year, we&#x2019;ve been shouting &quot;hooray for Steph and his Warriors,&quot; I think now that &quot;Really? Does it have to be Harden?&quot; has become its own anti-narrative. We now have to wriggle away from his strong case in order to keep the good vibes alive.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.k">If you go with Devin&#x2019;s argument that the Warriors have so much support that Steph&#x2019;s role is diminished, then Harden might be the guy. On paper, he&#x2019;s doing more than anyone with very little support in a way that doesn&#x2019;t come off as irresponsible or selfish. Whether through scoring or playmaking, he&#x2019;s responsible for a higher percentage of his team&#x2019;s offense than anyone else in the league. And unlike with Westbrook, you never feel like he&#x2019;s drowning anyone else out. I can argue all day that the Warriors rely heavily on Curry for their identity but without Harden the Rockets are barren. I also can&#x2019;t help but point out, though, that Harden is the focal point of the team while Curry actually creates a team around him.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.l">But for some reason, no one wants to vote for him, or feels compelled to admit they would do so grudgingly. That&#x2019;s too strong: Apathy and resignation are also part of the equation. But as the season wraps up, it&#x2019;s gotten more difficult to ignore Harden. Defeating him is as important as someone else winning. Part of it has to do with all that&#x2019;s cold and analytic about the Rockets&#x2014;and definitely, a vote for Harden comes from the head, not the heart&#x2014;but as Myles said, there&#x2019;s also just the creeping sense that there&#x2019;s something unsavory or unfair about the way Harden plays. Harden, for all his creativity and off-court charisma, makes us groan in dismay. He&#x2019;s not even really a heel, just an unappealing player. His constant trips to the line, which have become both punchline and qualifier when really they&#x2019;re just smart basketball, aren&#x2019;t even the problem. Rather, they&#x2019;re symptomatic of a larger malaise around Harden.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.m">If Myles is right that this is a vote about the future of the NBA, I&#x2019;ll go even further and say that it&#x2019;s about our relationship with the sport. Do we want to fall in love every night as we do via Curry or be prodded into acceptance and appreciation like with Harden? That&#x2019;s also why I&#x2019;d say that Davis and Westbrook continue to capture the imagination and hang around in the conversation despite their dark horse standing. As the league goes through a transitional period, we&#x2019;re on the verge of asserting that there&#x2019;s way more to the league (and our consumption of it) than sheer performance. In Curry&#x2019;s case, best player on best team also has a feel-good, get-them-up-out-their-seats quality to it. We like seeing the Warriors win. We like seeing him push them. We are ourselves better because of them because it proves that there is joy in sports.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>Devin Gordon:</strong> OK, OK&#x2014;you guys have sold me. I&#x2019;m scratching James Harden off my list. I knew there was an undercurrent of disdain for him out there, but I had no idea it was a goddam Rio Grande. And maybe I&#x2019;m just being a hack for privileging my affection for his magnificent beard, droll wit and mellifluous singing voice over his foul-hoarding, nut-shotting, on-the-court histrionics. That being said, isn&#x2019;t a slashing guard supposed to get to the foul line? There&#x2019;s something airy and unfair to me about slagging the guy for being preternaturally gifted at his job&#x2014;it&#x2019;s privileging aesthetics over pure performance and trying to graft onto an argument about morality. (I also just can&#x2019;t reconcile Harden as a cold, calculating basketball machine with my general sense of him as an odd duck in a superstar&#x2019;s body.) That said, I also accept Myles&#x2019;s MVP criteria: that there&#x2019;s a difference between a playing style that helps a team rack up wins and a transcendent, arc-of-history-bending style that advances the cause of basketball in the free world. So OK, James Harden, you&#x2019;re out.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.o">But I&#x2019;m having a harder time letting go completely of the more conventional definition of an MVP: indispensability. Curry&#x2019;s great season has come with the lowest stakes: Golden State is a playoff team with or without him&#x2014;his existence means that they&#x2019;ll just make a deeper run. Probably a much deeper run. For OKC, though, Westbrook is the difference between a possible postseason trip and outright disaster. Ditto for Anthony Davis. Maybe the MVP should go to the guy whose team grabs that last playoff spot?</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.p"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55828f4ce52bc4b477a98d46/master/w_768/blogs-the-feed-anthony-davis.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-anthony-davis.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-anthony-davis.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-anthony-davis.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828f4ce52bc4b477a98d46%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-anthony-davis.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-anthony-davis.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828f4ce52bc4b477a98d46%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-anthony-davis.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-anthony-davis.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.q">This is a regular season award, after all. And there&#x2019;s no bigger fault line in sports than the one separating teams that make the playoffs from the ones who don&#x2019;t.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>Myles Brown:</strong> The goal of every team should be to win a championship. So that is the value to be examined, no? Davis and Westbrook have clearly established themselves as unprecedented talents and true transformational players. Yet in a league where more than half the teams advance to the playoffs, how much of an accomplishment is seven extra games before summer vacation? It&#x2019;s certainly not to be ignored, but the need to recognize them shouldn&#x2019;t rearrange our priorities.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.s">These won&#x2019;t be the first players whose singular brilliance has gone unrecognized. Harden wouldn&#x2019;t be the first to lose for a lack of likability either. Their numbers are historic, but as Shoals noted, if history has taught us anything, it&#x2019;s that this award is a popularity contest, subject to the whims of a cruel and fickle public. Magic <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_1982.html">lost</a> because he got his coach fired. Isaiah <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_1989.html">lost</a> because he was a Bad Boy. Jordan <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_1993.html">lost</a> because we got bored. Kobe <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2006.html">lost</a> because we got mad. Chris Paul <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2008.html">lost </a>because it was Kobe&#x2019;s turn. LeBron <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/awards_2011.html">lost</a> because we got mad, now he&#x2019;ll lose again because we got bored. Every year, the voting booth is littered with the ashes of excellence. But are we discussing what an MVP is or what it should be?</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.t">This year&#x2019;s race is particularly compelling due to so many archetypes arising simultaneously, yet after sifting through them, we still arrive at Devin&#x2019;s issue of indispensability. It is paramount; there&#x2019;s a distinct difference between leading the team and being the team. However, it would be misleading to think that&#x2019;s the case with our frontrunners in Curry and Harden. If the only mustered argument against Curry is that his team is too good, then there is no argument. Lest we forget, Golden State spent last summer ditching their coach and dangling their second best player as trade bait. This isn&#x2019;t a team of perennial All-Stars and future Hall of Famers. They&#x2019;re a cohesive unit who thrive in their respective roles thanks to Curry. He leads with unselfishness and finishes games with fearlessness. For a team that has dominated both standings and statistics, perhaps the most telling number is their 15.7 point differential with Curry off the court. Ignoring this in favor of another great on a lesser team would be declaring the most valuable circumstances, not the most valuable player.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.u"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55828f4c1177d66d68d53b53/master/w_768/blogs-the-feed-lebron-james.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-lebron-james.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-lebron-james.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-lebron-james.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828f4c1177d66d68d53b53%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-lebron-james.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-lebron-james.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828f4c1177d66d68d53b53%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-lebron-james.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-lebron-james.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.v">The whole point of this discussion, though, wasn&#x2019;t just to <em>debate</em> the award but to get inside the debate about the award. What&#x2019;s becoming clear is that arguments for or against players are less important than the players themselves. Looking at the list of past winners, what jumps out is that playing well or winning games was never enough to get the MVP. Players had to bring something more to the table; they had to prove, as Myles said, that they were leaving their stamp on the sport, if only for the year. Having a neatly-packaged story for voters isn&#x2019;t as important as having resonance within the basketball community.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.w"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55828f4c1177d66d68d53b51/master/w_768/blogs-the-feed-chris-paul.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-chris-paul.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-chris-paul.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-chris-paul.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828f4c1177d66d68d53b51%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-chris-paul.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-chris-paul.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fnba-mvp-steph-curry-james-harden&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828f4c1177d66d68d53b51%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-chris-paul.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-chris-paul.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.x">At the risk of sounding vague, the MVP is a gut award. It says, in pretty simple terms, who this year have we given the most fucks about, who we fucked with the most, who has done the most to make this season so (fucking) memorable. By this logic, Westbrook goes from longshot to runner-up. But at the end of the day, only one player has been appointment viewing all season long. Only one guy has been changing the way we thought a championship team could be organized. And only one of these six candidates has been on the tip of our tongues since the first few games of the year. That&#x2019;s Stephen Curry. If you don&#x2019;t agree, then we&#x2019;re not even debating the same trophy.</p><p data-reactid=".1cjp4b4nshs.1.1.0.0.4.y"><strong>Devin Gordon:</strong> Does this mean it&#x2019;s too late to
