  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A I am rushing to the emergency room to meet a real-life superhero called Phoenix Jones, who has fought one crime too many and is currently peeing a lot of blood. Five nights a week, Phoenix dresses in a superhero outfit of his own invention and chases car thieves and breaks up bar fights and changes the tires of stranded strangers. I\u0027ve flown to Seattle to join him on patrol. I landed only a few minutes ago, at midnight on a Friday in early March, and in the arrivals lounge I phoned his friend and spokesman, Peter Tangen, who told me the news.\u000A\u000A \u0022Hospital?\u0022 I said. \u0022Is he okay?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I don\u0027t know,\u0022 said Peter. He sounded worried. \u0022The thing you have to remember about Phoenix is that he\u0027s not impervious to pain.\u0022 He paused. \u0022You should get a taxi straight from the airport to there.\u0022\u000A\u000A At 1 a.m. I arrive at the ER and am led into Phoenix\u0027s room. And there he is: a young and extremely muscular black man lying in bed in a hospital smock, strapped to an IV, tubes attached to his body. Most disconcertingly, he\u0027s wearing a full-face black-and-gold rubber superhero mask.\u000A\u000A \u0022Good to meet you!\u0022 he hollers enthusiastically through the mouth hole. He gives me the thumbs-up, which makes the IV needle tear his skin slightly. \u0022Ow,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A His 2-year-old son and 4-year-old stepson run fractiously around the room. \u0022Daddy was out fighting bad guys in his super suit, and now he has to wait here,\u0022 he tells them. Then he makes me promise to identify neither them nor his girlfriend, to protect his secret identity.\u000A\u000A He looks frustrated, hemmed in, fizzing with restless energy. \u0022We break up two or three acts of violence a night,\u0022 he says. \u0022Two or three people are being hurt right now, and I\u0027m stuck here. It bothers me.\u0022\u000A\u000A By \u0022we\u0022 he means his ten-strong Seattle crew, the Rain City Superheroes. A few hours ago, they were patrolling when they saw a guy swinging a baseball bat at another guy outside a bar. \u0022I ran across the street, and he jabbed me in the stomach,\u0022 he says, pointing at a spot just below his belly button. \u0022Right under my armor.\u0022\u000A\u000A Unfortunately the head of the bat landed exactly where he\u0027d been punched a week earlier by another bar brawler holding a car key in his fist. That attack had burst a hole right through Phoenix\u0027s skin.\u000A\u000A \u0022A few hours ago I went to use the bathroom and I started peeing blood,\u0022 he says. \u0022A lot of it.\u0022\u000A\u000A I glance over at Phoenix\u0027s girlfriend. \u0022There\u0027s no point worrying about it,\u0022 she says with a shrug.\u000A\u000A Finally the doctor arrives with the test results. \u0022The good news is there\u0027s no serious damage,\u0022 he says. \u0022You\u0027re bruised. Rest. It\u0027s very important that you go home and rest. By the way, why do you name a pediatrician as your doctor?\u0022 \u0022You\u0027re allowed to stay with your pediatrician until you\u0027re 22,\u0022 Phoenix explains.\u000A\u000A We both look surprised: This big masked man, six feet one and 205 pounds, is barely out of boyhood.\u000A\u000A \u0022Go home and rest,\u0022 says the doctor, leaving the room.\u000A\u000A Phoenix watches him go. There\u0027s a short silence. \u0022Let\u0027s hit the streets!\u0022 he hollers. \u0022My crew is out there somewhere. I\u0027ll get suited up!\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Phoenix didn\u0027t know this when he first donned the suit about a year ago, but he\u0027s one of around 200 real-life superheroes currently patrolling America\u0027s streets, looking for wrongs to right. There\u0027s DC\u0027s Guardian, in Washington, who wears a full-body stars-and-stripes outfit and wanders the troubled areas behind the Capitol building. There\u0027s RazorHawk, from Minneapolis, who was a pro wrestler for fifteen years before joining the RLSH movement. There\u0027s New York City\u0027s Dark Guardian, who specializes in chasing pot dealers out of Washington Square Park by creeping up to them, shining a light in their eyes, and yelling, \u0022This is a drug-free park!\u0022 And there are dozens and dozens more. Few, if any, are as daring as Phoenix. Most undertake basically safe community work: helping the homeless, telling kids to stay off drugs, etc. They\u0027re regular men with jobs and families and responsibilities who somehow have enough energy at the end of the day to journey into America\u0027s neediest neighborhoods to do what they can.\u000A\u000A Every superhero has his origin story, and as we drive from the hospital to his apartment, Phoenix tells me his. His life, he says, hasn\u0027t been a breeze. He lived for a time in a Texas orphanage, was adopted by a Seattle family around age 9, and now spends his days working with autistic kids. One night last summer, someone broke into his car. There was shattered glass on the floor, and his stepson gashed his knee on it.\u000A\u000A \u0022I got tired of people doing things that are morally questionable,\u0022 he says. \u0022Everyone\u0027s afraid. It just takes one person to say, \u0027I\u0027m not afraid.\u0027 And I guess I\u0027m that guy.\u0022\u000A\u000A The robber had left his mask in the car, so Phoenix picked it up and made his own mask from it. \u0022He used the mask to conceal his identity,\u0022 he says. \u0022I used the mask to become an identity.\u0022\u000A\u000A He called himself Phoenix Jones because the Phoenix rises from the ashes and Jones is one of America\u0027s most common surnames: He was the common man rising from society\u0027s ashes.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s 2:30 a.m. by the time we reach his very messy apartment, where he quickly changes into his full superhero costume: a black-and-gold rubber suit complete with stab plates and a pouch for his Taser and Mace. \u0022It\u0027s bulletproof,\u0022 he tells me.\u000A\u000A We head downtown and park in the business district, a bunch of empty office buildings in a nice part of Seattle. Other than some junkies and drunks wandering around like zombies, the place is deserted. We see neither his crew nor any crime.\u000A\u000A \u0022How are you feeling?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m in a lot of pain,\u0022 he says. \u0022The cut\u0027s still bleeding, internally and externally. A couple of my old injuries are flaring up, like some broken ribs. I\u0027m having a rough night.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Maybe you\u0027re going too hard,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A \u0022Crime doesn\u0027t care how I feel,\u0022 he replies.\u000A\u000A Just then a young man approaches us. He\u0027s sweating, looking distressed. \u0022I\u0027ve been crying, dude!\u0022 he yells.\u000A\u000A He\u0027s here on vacation, he explains. His parents live a two-hour bus ride away, in central Washington, and he\u0027s only $9.40 short for the fare home. \u0022I\u0027ve asked sixty people,\u0022 he pleads. \u0022Will you touch my heart, save my life, and give me $9.40?\u0022\u000A\u000A Phoenix turns to me. \u0022You down for a car-ride adventure?\u0022 he says excitedly. \u0022We\u0027re going to drive the guy back to his parents!\u0022\u000A\u000A The young man looks panicked. \u0022Honestly, $9.40 is fine...,\u0022 he says, backing away slightly.\u000A\u000A \u0022No, no!\u0022 says Phoenix. \u0022We\u0027re going to drive you home! Where\u0027s your luggage?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Um, in storage at the train station...,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A \u0022We\u0027ll meet you there in ten minutes!\u0022 says Phoenix.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Thirty minutes later: the train station. The man hasn\u0027t showed up. Phoenix narrows his eyes. \u0022I think he was trying to scam us,\u0022 he says, looking genuinely surprised.\u000A\u000A Does this guilelessness make him delightfully naive, I wonder, or disturbingly naive? He is, after all, planning to lead me into some hazardous situations this weekend.\u000A\u000A At 4 a.m. we finally locate his crew on a corner near the station. Tonight there\u0027s Pitch Black, Ghost, and Red Dragon. They\u0027re all costumed and masked and, although in good shape, smaller and stockier than Phoenix. He stands tall among them and does most of the talking, too. They\u0027re monosyllabic, as if deferring to their leader.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A They have a visitor—a superhero from Oregon named Knight Owl. He\u0027s been fighting crime since January 2008 and is in town for a comic-book convention. He\u0027s tall, masked, and muscular, in his late twenties, and dressed in a black-and-yellow costume. It is similar to, but less awesome than, Phoenix\u0027s sculpted and buffed one. The crew briefs Phoenix on a group of crack addicts and dealers loitering at a nearby bus stop. A plan is formed. They\u0027ll just walk slowly past them to show who\u0027s boss. No confrontation. Just an intimidating walk-by.\u000A\u000A We spot them right away. There are ten of them, clustered in a tight group, looking old and wired, talking animatedly. When they see us, they fall silent and shoot us wary glances, probably wondering what the superheroes are talking about.\u000A\u000A This is what the superheroes are talking about:\u000A\u000AKnight Owl: I\u0027ve discovered a maskmaker who does these really awesome owl masks. They\u0027re made out of old gas masks.&gt;\u000A\u000APhoenix: Like what Urban Avenger\u0027s got?&gt;undefined&gt;\u000A\u000AKnight Owl: Sort of, but owl-themed. I\u0027m going to ask her if she\u0027ll put my logo on it in brass.&gt;undefined&gt;\u000A\u000APhoenix: That\u0027s awesome. By the way, I really like your color scheme.&gt;undefined&gt;\u000A\u000AKnight Owl: Thank you. I think the yellow really pops.\u000A\u000A We\u0027re ten feet away now. The superhero chatter ceases, and the only sound is the squeak of my luggage wheels as I roll them down the street. Up close, these dealers and addicts look exhausted, burnt-out.\u000A\u000A Leave them alone, I think. Haven\u0027t they got enough to deal with? They\u0027ll be gone by the time any daytime people wake up. Why can\u0027t they have their hour at the bus stop? Plus, aren\u0027t we prodding a hornet\u0027s nest? Couldn\u0027t this be like the Taco Incident times a thousand?\u000A\u000A The Taco Incident. Ever since Phoenix appeared on CNN in January in a short segment extolling his acts of derring-do, the superhero community has been rife with grumbling. Many of them, evidently jealous of Phoenix\u0027s stunning rise, have been spreading rumors. The chief gossips have been N.Y.C.\u0027s Dark Guardian and Seattle\u0027s Mr. Raven Blade. They say Phoenix is not as brave as he likes people to believe, that he\u0027s in it for personal gain, and that his presence on the streets only serves to escalate matters. To support this last criticism, they cite the Taco Incident.\u000A\u000A Phoenix sighs. \u0022It was a drunk driver. He was getting into his car, so I tried to give him a taco and some water to sober him up. He didn\u0027t want it. Eventually he got kind of violent. He tried to shove me. So I pulled out my Taser, and I fired some warning shots. Then the police showed up....\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I didn\u0027t realize he was a drunk driver,\u0022 I said. \u0022The other superheroes implied it was just a regular random guy you were trying to force a taco onto. But still—\u0022 I gesture at the nearby crack dealers—\u0022the Taco Incident surely demonstrates how things can inadvertently spiral.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022They\u0027re in my house,\u0022 he resolutely replies. \u0022Any corner where people go, that\u0027s my corner. And I\u0027m going to defend it.\u0022\u000A\u000A We walk slowly past the bus stop. Nothing happens. Everyone just mutters angrily at one another.\u000A\u000A It is now 5 a.m. Our first night\u0027s patrolling together ends. I\u0027m glad, as I found that last part a little frightening. I am not a naturally confrontational person, and I\u0027d really like to check into my hotel and go to bed.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The real-life-superhero movement began, the folklore goes, back in 1980, when someone by the name of the Night Rider published a book called How to Be a Superhero. But the phenomenon really took hold a few years later when a young man from New Orleans (whose true identity is still a closely guarded secret) built a silver suit, called himself Master Legend, and stepped out onto the streets. He was an influential if erratic inspiration to those that followed.\u000A\u000A \u0022Ninety percent of us think Master Legend is crazy,\u0022 Phoenix told me. \u0022He\u0027s always drinking. He believes he was born wearing a purple veil and has died three times. But he does great deeds of heroism. He once saw someone try to rape a girl, and he beat the guy so severely he ended up in a hospital for almost a month. He\u0027s an enigma.\u0022\u000A\u000A So what happened next? How did the RLSH movement grow from one visionary in Louisiana to 200 crusaders and counting? Well, the rise of the mega-comic conventions has certainly helped. I remember a friend, the film director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World), returning from his first San Diego Comic Con saucer-eyed with tales of hitherto reclusive geeks wandering around in elaborate homemade costumes, their heads held high. \u0022It was like Geek Pride,\u0022 he said.\u000A\u000A The community continued to blossom post-September 11 and especially during the recession of the past few years. Inspired by real-life-superhero comic books like Watchmen and Kick-Ass, both of which became movies, RLSHs have been cropping up all over the place. There\u0027s no national convention or gathering, but Peter Tangen is doing all he can to make them a cohesive community with a robust online presence.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Tangen\u0027s origin story is as remarkable as any of the RLSHs\u0027. By day he\u0027s a Hollywood studio photographer, responsible for a great many movie posters—Spider-Man, Batman Begins, Thor, Hellboy, Fantastic Four. But he\u0027s always felt like a cog in the machine. \u0022I\u0027m one of those guys who toils in obscurity,\u0022 he says. \u0022Nobody knows my name, because you don\u0027t get credit on a movie poster.\u0022\u000A\u000A When he learned there were people doing in real life what the likes of Tobey Maguire and Christian Bale pretend to do on a film set, it inspired him. So he approached the RLSHs, offering to photograph them in heroic, unironic poses. His hope is to make them seem valiant and worthy of respect, not just the goofy story about the crazy nerd at the end of the local newscast. His portraits are all displayed on his website, The Real Life Super Hero Project. The site has become Peter\u0027s calling in life—his attempt to be, like the men he celebrates, exceptional.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A The morning after my first night with Phoenix, I have coffee at a downtown Seattle café with Knight Owl, a former graphic designer who joined the movement because \u0022I wanted something more with my life.\u0022 He tells me about common rookie mistakes, such as adopting a superhero name that\u0027s already in use. \u0022It\u0027s a general faux pas—anything with the words night, shadow, phantom... Those dark-vigilante-type-sounding names tend to get snapped up pretty fast.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Have there been any other Knight Owls?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A \u0022There was an Owl,\u0022 he says. \u0022The Owl. But he ended up changing his name to Scar Heart, since he\u0027d had a heart transplant.\u0022\u000A\u000A He says he chose his name before he knew there was a Nite Owl in the Watchmen comic, so when people online tell him, \u0022You\u0027re a fucking pussy, and by the way, Knight Owl\u0027s taken—haven\u0027t you seen Watchmen?\u0022 they don\u0027t know what they\u0027re talking about.\u000A\u000A The second rookie mistake is to \u0022get caught up in the paraphernalia. People should think more about the functionality.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I assume capes aren\u0027t functional,\u0022 I say, \u0022because they can get snagged on things.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022If you\u0027re going to do some serious crime fighting, there\u0027d better be a good reason for a cape,\u0022 he nods. \u0022And grappling hooks—no, no, no, no, no! What? You think you\u0027re going to scale a building? What are you going to do when you get up there? Swoop down? Parachute down? You\u0027re not going to have enough distance for the parachute to even open.\u0022\u000A\u000A Knight Owl seems to regard Phoenix as the real thing in a community rife with wannabes. That\u0027s how Phoenix sees himself, too. When I asked him why he seems to be capturing the public\u0027s imagination in a way that the other RLSHs haven\u0027t, he attributes it to his bravery. Others, he says, talk the talk but in reality just hand out food to the homeless and would probably run shrieking from danger if they ever chanced upon it.\u000A\u000A \u0022When you wake up one day and decide to put on spandex and give out sandwiches, something\u0027s a little off,\u0022 Phoenix says. \u0022I call them real-life sandwich handlers.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A I want to see another superhero operation to compare to Phoenix, so I fly to San Diego to meet Mr. Xtreme. He\u0027s been patrolling since 2006, the past eight months with his protégé, Urban Avenger. They pick me up at 9 p.m. outside my hotel. Both are heavily costumed. Mr. Xtreme is a thickset man—a security guard by day—wearing a green-and-black cape, a bulletproof vest, a green helmet, and a visor upon which fake eyes have been eerily painted. His outfit is covered with stickers of a woman\u0027s face: Kitty Genovese. In March 1964, in an infamous incident that shamed New York City, Genovese was stabbed near her apartment in Kew Gardens, Queens. Her attacker ran away. During the next half hour, several of her neighbors saw her or heard her screaming and did nothing. Then her attacker returned and killed her. She has become a talisman for the RLSH movement.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A You cannot see an inch of Urban Avenger\u0027s body. He\u0027s wearing a weird customized gas mask, green-tinted sunglasses, a red full-length hoodie, and long black leather gloves. Underneath it all he looks quite small and skinny. He says he\u0027s in his late twenties, has children, and works \u0022in the food-service industry.\u0022 That\u0027s all he\u0027ll reveal to me.\u000A\u000A He says he loves being covered from head to toe. \u0022When I wear this, I don\u0027t have to react to you in any way. Nobody knows what I\u0027m thinking or feeling. It\u0027s great. I can be in my own little world in here.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I know exactly what you mean,\u0022 I say. \u0022I was once at a Halloween party and I didn\u0027t take off my mask all night. It completely eliminated all social anxiety.\u0022 \u0022Sometimes I wish I never had to take the mask off,\u0022 says Urban Avenger.\u000A\u000A We begin our patrol through the clean, well-to-do streets of downtown San Diego. We pass bars and clubs filled with polite-looking young drinkers. A few take pictures of the superheroes on their phones. Others yell, \u0022It isn\u0027t Halloween anymore!\u0022 from car windows. Urban Avenger says he doesn\u0027t understand how Phoenix is forever chancing upon crimes being committed. He\u0027s just lucky.\u000A\u000A \u0022What are the odds?\u0022 he sighs. \u0022I almost never see anything.\u0022 He pauses. \u0022Last October we got involved in breaking up some street fights.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Five months ago?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022It\u0027s been really quiet around here ever since.\u0022\u000A\u000A He says Phoenix is fortunate to have the scary district of Belltown on his doorstep. \u0022Google \u0027gunshots in Belltown\u0027 and you\u0027ll come up with a hundred stories of gunshots being fired in, like, the last year,\u0022 he says wistfully.\u000A\u000A Some boys pass us. \u0022Want some reefer? Ganga? Weed?\u0022 they say, sotto voce.\u000A\u000A \u0022No,\u0022 says Urban Avenger, walking quickly on. The boys shrug and continue on their way.\u000A\u000A \u0022Good thing I got all that on video,\u0022 Urban Avenger eventually calls after them, indicating a small camera attached to his shoulder.\u000A\u000A \u0022Crack? Heroin? PCP?\u0022 the boys call back.\u000A\u000A \u0022Did you really film it?\u0022 I ask.\u000A\u000A \u0022No,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A \u0022I noticed you didn\u0027t attempt a citizen\u0027s arrest,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A \u0022We didn\u0027t have probable cause,\u0022 explains Mr. Xtreme. \u0022All they did is say something. If they\u0027d shown us crack rocks or marijuana, it might have been a different story.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022You could have said you wanted to buy some, and then they\u0027d have produced the drugs and you could have arrested them,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A There\u0027s a short silence. \u0022That\u0027s true,\u0022 says Urban Avenger.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Back in Seattle, we start our second patrol at 1 a.m. on Saturday night. Phoenix is in a bad way. He\u0027s still ailing from the key-punching and the baseball-bat incidents and has now developed a fever of 102.5.\u000A\u000A \u0022I found out this morning I have tetanus,\u0022 he tells me.\u000A\u000A \u0022You have to sleep,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A \u0022No sleeping for us,\u0022 says Phoenix.\u000A\u000A I\u0027m starting to like Phoenix a lot. For all his naïveté, there\u0027s something infectiously upbeat about him. He\u0027s forever cheerful and positive and energetic. I ask him if he\u0027s addicted to crime fighting, and he says, \u0022I guess you could put it in the addiction category. It\u0027s the highlight of my day. Addictions are normally detrimental to health. This is detrimental to my health.\u0022\u000A\u000A He puts his positive spirit down to a stable home life: \u0022I\u0027ve been with my girlfriend since I was 16. I make my own money. To be a successful superhero, you\u0027ve got to have your life in line.\u0022\u000A\u000A We begin in Pioneer Square. We\u0027re a small team tonight; Pitch Black and Ghost are Phoenix\u0027s only companions. The bars are closing, and drunk kids are piling onto the streets, but there\u0027s still a frustrating absence of crime. But then, from somewhere up the street, we hear a shout: \u0022I\u0027m going to fuck you, bitch.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A \u0022Let\u0027s go!\u0022 yells Phoenix. He, Ghost, Pitch Black, and I start to run frantically toward the mystery commotion.\u000A\u000A \u0022It\u0027s the YouTube guy!\u0022 a nearby teenager shouts delightedly. \u0022Can I get a picture?\u0022\u000A\u000A Phoenix screeches to a halt. \u0022I\u0027ll be right with you guys!\u0022 he calls to us. He poses for the girl.\u000A\u000A \u0022Phoenix!\u0022 I sigh.\u000A\u000A The real-life superheroes like to portray their motives as wholly benevolent, but if they were driven purely by altruism, they\u0027d have become police officers or firefighters or charity volunteers. Something else is evidently propelling them—a touch of narcissism. It\u0027s an odd sort of narcissism, of course, when the narcissist disguises his face, but the lust for fame and glory is unmistakable. By the time Phoenix has had his picture taken, the potential criminal and victim are nowhere to be seen.\u000A\u000A Two uneventful hours pass. By 3 a.m. we are losing hope. Phoenix is reduced to suggesting we rent a hotel room, phone some prostitutes, and ask them on their arrival if they need help escaping the web of prostitution.\u000A\u000A \u0022I think the problem with the plan,\u0022 I say, \u0022is if a prostitute turns up at a hotel room and sees three men in masks, she\u0027s not going to immediately think \u0027superhero.\u0027 Plus, she may have to travel all the way across Seattle. It\u0027ll be an hour out of her night.\u0022 They agree to abandon the idea.\u000A\u000A Suddenly we notice a man across the street drop a small, clear bag on the ground at the feet of another man.\u000A\u000A \u0022Yahtzee!\u0022 yells Phoenix. He rushes across the road. \u0022What did you just drop?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Pretzels,\u0022 says the man, picking the bag up and showing it to us.\u000A\u000A There\u0027s a silence. \u0022Good,\u0022 says Phoenix.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Our very last hope is Belltown. When we turn the corner into the district, everything changes. By day this place is nice: art galleries, bars, restaurants. It\u0027s just down the road from the famous Pike Place Market. But now, at 4 a.m., the two or three blocks in front of me look as menacing and desperate as the projects from The Wire. The dealers staring at us look nothing like the exhausted old crackheads from the bus stop. These are large gangs of wiry young men. They stand on every block. The police are nowhere to be seen. I take in the scene and instinctively take a small step backward.\u000A\u000A \u0022There\u0027s a possibility we could get into a fight,\u0022 whispers Pitch Black. \u0022If that happens, back off, okay?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022What are you doing?\u0022 a man calls from across the street, outside a shuttered-up liquor store.\u000A\u000A \u0022Patrolling,\u0022 Phoenix calls back. \u0022What are you doing?\u0022\u000A\u000A He, Pitch Black, and Ghost walk toward him. He\u0027s with eight other men.\u000A\u000A \u0022You\u0027ve got to respect people\u0027s block, man,\u0022 the guy is saying. \u0022You don\u0027t come down here with your ski masks on. What are you doing, getting yourselves entwined in people\u0027s lives? You guys are going to get hurt. You understand? You want to see our burners?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I don\u0027t care,\u0022 says Phoenix.\u000A\u000A \u0022You don\u0027t care?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Not really. I\u0027ve already been shot once.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027ve been shot three times!\u0022 another guy says, looking weirdly proud. \u0022One motherfucker round here got shot in the nighttime. Innocent bystanders get shot here. Think about the bigger picture. You\u0027re putting your lives on the line. If you guys are in a casket, your mamas are going to be like, \u0027For what?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Don\u0027t be a hero,\u0022 a third man adds. \u0022That superhero shit? You\u0027re going to get hurt, fucking around. How you feed your family is not how we feed our family. We\u0027re not out here for the fun and the show-and-tell. This is real life.\u0022\u000A\u000A I am finding myself ostentatiously nodding at everything the crack dealers are saying, I suppose in the hope that if the shooting starts, they\u0027ll remember my nods and make an effort to shoot around me.\u000A\u000A \u0022I appreciate the info,\u0022 says Phoenix.\u000A\u000A Suddenly the first guy takes a step forward and peers at Phoenix through his mask.\u000A\u000A \u0022You\u0027re a brother?\u0022 he says. \u0022You\u0027re a BROTHER and you\u0027re out here looking like THIS? You\u0027ve got to be out of your fucking mind, man.\u0022\u000A\u000A And then it all changes. \u0022I feel threatened right now,\u0022 the guy says. \u0022You\u0027ve got ski masks on. I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re trying to rob me. A guy got shot last Friday in Belltown by somebody with a mask on. Is that you?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022You don\u0027t have to be here,\u0022 says Phoenix. \u0022You\u0027ve got choices.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027ve been in the system since I was 10 years old!\u0022 he yells. \u0022I haven\u0027t got no choices! When your kids get older, this is going to be the same shit.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I disagree,\u0022 says Phoenix.\u000A\u000A \u0022It can\u0027t be better!\u0022 the man yells. \u0022This is it!\u0022\u000A\u000A The dealers withdraw up the block to decide what to do next.\u000A\u000A \u0022Have a good night,\u0022 calls Phoenix. \u0022Good meeting you.\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A They\u0027re watching us, murmuring to one another. Their problem is that nobody wants to buy crack in front of three men dressed as superheroes. While Phoenix and his crew stand here, they\u0027re losing all their business.\u000A\u000A Phoenix points to two packs of cigarettes under the windshield wiper of a nearby car.\u000A\u000A \u0022Those are indications that you can buy here,\u0022 he says. \u0022So I\u0027m going to take them off and annoy the crap out of them.\u0022\u000A\u000A He scrunches the packets up and throws them onto the sidewalk.\u000A\u000A At this, one of the gang heads toward us. If you were watching from across the road, it would seem as if he just wanders past, but in fact he whispers something as he does: \u0022You keep staying on our block, we gonna have to show you what the burner do.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Thank you, it\u0027s great meeting you,\u0022 says Phoenix.\u000A\u000A The man loops and rejoins the others.\u000A\u000A The streets are deserted, and it\u0027s starting to feel exceedingly dangerous. It\u0027s just the dealers and their guns and us. But then, miraculously, a taxi passes. I flag it. The superheroes all have (supposedly) bulletproof vests. I have a cardigan. \u0022I\u0027ll give you $20 to just stay here,\u0022 I say to the driver.\u000A\u000A He looks around. \u0022No,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A \u0022Thirty dollars?\u0022\u000A\u000A And then, suddenly, the whole gang, all nine of them, some with their hands down their trousers as if they\u0027re holding guns just under their waistlines, walk toward us. I can\u0027t see much of Phoenix under the suit, but I can see by the way his hands are shaking that he is terrified.\u000A\u000A \u0022My shift is over,\u0022 calls the taxi driver. \u0022I need to go home now.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Forty dollars!\u0022 I yell. \u0022Just stay there!\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022I don\u0027t care about the money!\u0022 the driver yells. But he doesn\u0027t move.\u000A\u000A The men get closer.\u000A\u000A \u0022Are we leaving or are we standing?\u0022 says Phoenix.\u000A\u000A \u0022We\u0027re standing,\u0022 says Ghost.\u000A\u000A \u0022We\u0027re standing,\u0022 says Pitch Black.\u000A\u000A \u0022You\u0027re willing to die for this shit?\u0022 the first guy, who seems to be the leader, is yelling. \u0022You\u0027re willing to DIE for this shit? You guys are dumb motherfuckers. I don\u0027t even know what to say. You guys are fucking stupid.\u0022 He stares at Phoenix. A moment passes. This is what I imagine a standoff feels like the instant before the shooting starts. But then his voice softens. \u0022If you guys are going to stand here and die for it, I guess we\u0027re going to have to walk home. We should shoot your ass, but I guess we\u0027ve got to go home.\u0022\u000A\u000A And they do. They disperse. They go home.\u000A\u000A Stunned, I look at Phoenix. He suddenly seems smaller than six feet one, lighter than 205 pounds, younger than twentysomething. \u0022You won!\u0022 I tell him.\u000A\u000A \u0022They had the weapons, the numbers, but they backed down to the image of Phoenix Jones,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A I feel an impulse to celebrate with him, but suddenly the full weight of the evening comes crashing down on me.\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m going to bed,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A \u0022We\u0027ll stand here for ten minutes and solidify the corner,\u0022 he replies. \u0022You don\u0027t want to stand with us?\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Definitely not,\u0022 I say.\u000A\u000A I jump into the taxi. And when I arrive back at the hotel, my legs buckle and I almost fall onto the floor.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A Five a.m. My phone rings. It\u0027s Phoenix, shrieking with laughter, babbling, hyperventilating, releasing all the adrenaline.\u000A\u000A \u0022That was ridiculously intense! In a few hours, I\u0027ve got to be a day-care worker!\u0022\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A It\u0027s the next afternoon. There\u0027s a comic convention in town, at the Washington State Convention Center in the business district. There are something like 30,000 people here, families and costumed comic fans, packing the modern glass building. I spot Knight Owl and another Seattle superhero named Skyman. He is only semicostumed. He\u0027s unmasked and goateed, and he\u0027s wearing a white T-shirt with a Skyman logo of his own design.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A \u0022Ooh, look, the Rocketeer!\u0022 he says at a passing costumed attendee. \u0022You never see Rocketeer costumes! That is priceless! I gotta get me a photo of that! Ooh! Lady Riddler! Nice!\u0022\u000A\u000A Skyman approaches a Batman. \u0022Is that a real bulletproof outfit?\u0022 he asks him. \u0022No,\u0022 Batman replies a little apologetically.\u000A\u000A \u0022This place,\u0022 I tell Knight Owl, \u0022is full of costumed people who would never confront drug dealers in the middle of the night. You and Phoenix and Skyman exist in some shadow world between fantasy and reality.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Yeah,\u0022 Knight Owl replies. \u0022What we do is hyperreality!\u0022\u000A\u000A And then there are cheers and gasps and applause: Phoenix Jones has arrived. He is a superstar here. He sees me and we hug—two brave warriors who have been through a great adventure together.\u000A\u000A \u0022Thank you for making our city safe!\u0022 a woman in the crowd calls out to him.\u000A\u000A \u0022You\u0027re a very cool man!\u0022 someone else shouts.\u000A\u000A I tell Phoenix it is time for me to leave.\u000A\u000A \u0022When you write this, be sure to tell everyone that what we do is dangerous,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000A \u0022I think you\u0027re great,\u0022 I say. \u0022But I\u0027m worried you\u0027re going to get yourself killed.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Well, don\u0027t make it seem like I\u0027d be dying for a choice,\u0022 he replies. \u0022I couldn\u0027t quit if I wanted. You know how many people in this city look up to me? I haven\u0027t paid for my own coffee in six months.\u0022\u000A\u000A And I suddenly realize I feel about Phoenix the same way everyone here does. I think he is an awesome superhero.\u000A\u000A As I walk out, I hear a father whisper to his young son, \u0022That\u0027s a real superhero.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022Are you a real superhero?\u0022 the little boy asks Phoenix.\u000A\u000A Phoenix looks down at him and smiles.\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m as real as you can get.\u0022",

Five nights a week, Phoenix dresses in a superhero outfit of his own invention and chases car thieves and breaks up bar fights and changes the tires of stranded strangers. I&apos;ve flown to Seattle to join him on patrol. I landed only a few minutes ago, at midnight on a Friday in early March, and in the arrivals lounge I phoned his friend and spokesman, Peter Tangen, who told me the news.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2"> &quot;<em>Hospital?</em>&quot; I said. &quot;Is he okay?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3"> &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Peter. He sounded worried. &quot;The thing you have to remember about Phoenix is that he&apos;s not impervious to pain.&quot; He paused. &quot;You should get a taxi straight from the airport to there.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.5"> At 1 a.m. I arrive at the ER and am led into Phoenix&apos;s room. And there he is: a young and extremely muscular black man lying in bed in a hospital smock, strapped to an IV, tubes attached to his body. Most disconcertingly, he&apos;s wearing a full-face black-and-gold rubber superhero mask.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.6"> &quot;Good to meet you!&quot; he hollers enthusiastically through the mouth hole. He gives me the thumbs-up, which makes the IV needle tear his skin slightly. &quot;Ow,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.7"> His 2-year-old son and 4-year-old stepson run fractiously around the room. &quot;Daddy was out fighting bad guys in his super suit, and now he has to wait here,&quot; he tells them. Then he makes me promise to identify neither them nor his girlfriend, to protect his secret identity.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.8"> He looks frustrated, hemmed in, fizzing with restless energy. &quot;We break up two or three acts of violence a night,&quot; he says. &quot;Two or three people are being hurt <em>right now</em>, and I&apos;m stuck here. It bothers me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.9"> By &quot;we&quot; he means his ten-strong Seattle crew, the Rain City Superheroes. A few hours ago, they were patrolling when they saw a guy swinging a baseball bat at another guy outside a bar. &quot;I ran across the street, and he jabbed me in the stomach,&quot; he says, pointing at a spot just below his belly button. &quot;Right under my armor.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.a"> Unfortunately the head of the bat landed exactly where he&apos;d been punched a week earlier by another bar brawler holding a car key in his fist. That attack had burst a hole right through Phoenix&apos;s skin.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.b"> &quot;A few hours ago I went to use the bathroom and I started peeing blood,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot of it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.c"> I glance over at Phoenix&apos;s girlfriend. &quot;There&apos;s no point worrying about it,&quot; she says with a shrug.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Finally the doctor arrives with the test results. &quot;The good news is there&apos;s no serious damage,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;re bruised. Rest. It&apos;s very important that you go home and rest. By the way, why do you name a pediatrician as your doctor?&quot; &quot;You&apos;re allowed to stay with your pediatrician until you&apos;re 22,&quot; Phoenix explains.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.e"> We both look surprised: This big masked man, six feet one and 205 pounds, is barely out of boyhood.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.f"> &quot;Go home and rest,&quot; says the doctor, leaving the room.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.g"> Phoenix watches him go. There&apos;s a short silence. &quot;Let&apos;s hit the streets!&quot; he hollers. &quot;My crew is out there somewhere.

There&apos;s DC&apos;s Guardian, in Washington, who wears a full-body stars-and-stripes outfit and wanders the troubled areas behind the Capitol building. There&apos;s RazorHawk, from Minneapolis, who was a pro wrestler for fifteen years before joining the RLSH movement. There&apos;s New York City&apos;s Dark Guardian, who specializes in chasing pot dealers out of Washington Square Park by creeping up to them, shining a light in their eyes, and yelling, &quot;This is a drug-free park!&quot; And there are dozens and dozens more. Few, if any, are as daring as Phoenix. Most undertake basically safe community work: helping the homeless, telling kids to stay off drugs, etc. They&apos;re regular men with jobs and families and responsibilities who somehow have enough energy at the end of the day to journey into America&apos;s neediest neighborhoods to do what they can.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.k"> Every superhero has his origin story, and as we drive from the hospital to his apartment, Phoenix tells me his. His life, he says, hasn&apos;t been a breeze. He lived for a time in a Texas orphanage, was adopted by a Seattle family around age 9, and now spends his days working with autistic kids. One night last summer, someone broke into his car. There was shattered glass on the floor, and his stepson gashed his knee on it.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.l"> &quot;I got tired of people doing things that are morally questionable,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone&apos;s afraid. It just takes one person to say, &apos;I&apos;m not afraid.&apos; And I guess I&apos;m that guy.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.m"> The robber had left his mask in the car, so Phoenix picked it up and made his own mask from it. &quot;He used the mask to conceal his identity,&quot; he says. &quot;I used the mask to <em>become</em> an identity.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.n"> He called himself Phoenix Jones because the Phoenix rises from the ashes and Jones is one of America&apos;s most common surnames: He was the common man rising from society&apos;s ashes.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.o"> It&apos;s 2:30 a.m. by the time we reach his very messy apartment, where he quickly changes into his full superhero costume: a black-and-gold rubber suit complete with stab plates and a pouch for his Taser and Mace. &quot;It&apos;s bulletproof,&quot; he tells me.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.p"> We head downtown and park in the business district, a bunch of empty office buildings in a nice part of Seattle. Other than some junkies and drunks wandering around like zombies, the place is deserted.

He&apos;s been fighting crime since January 2008 and is in town for a comic-book convention. He&apos;s tall, masked, and muscular, in his late twenties, and dressed in a black-and-yellow costume. It is similar to, but less awesome than, Phoenix&apos;s sculpted and buffed one. The crew briefs Phoenix on a group of crack addicts and dealers loitering at a nearby bus stop. A plan is formed. They&apos;ll just walk slowly past them to show who&apos;s boss. No confrontation. Just an intimidating walk-by.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.17"> We spot them right away. There are ten of them, clustered in a tight group, looking old and wired, talking animatedly. When they see us, they fall silent and shoot us wary glances, probably wondering what the superheroes are talking about.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.18"> This is what the superheroes are talking about:</p><div class="embed blockquote" data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.19"><blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Knight Owl:</strong> I&apos;ve discovered a maskmaker who does these really awesome owl masks.

I think the yellow really pops.</p></blockquote></div><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1e"> We&apos;re ten feet away now. The superhero chatter ceases, and the only sound is the squeak of my luggage wheels as I roll them down the street. Up close, these dealers and addicts look exhausted, burnt-out.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1f"> <em>Leave them alone, I think. Haven&apos;t they got enough to deal with? They&apos;ll be gone by the time any daytime people wake up. Why can&apos;t they have their hour at the bus stop? Plus, aren&apos;t we prodding a hornet&apos;s nest? Couldn&apos;t this be like the Taco Incident times a thousand?</em></p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1g"> The Taco Incident. Ever since Phoenix appeared on CNN in January in a short segment extolling his acts of derring-do, the superhero community has been rife with grumbling. Many of them, evidently jealous of Phoenix&apos;s stunning rise, have been spreading rumors. The chief gossips have been N.Y.C.&apos;s Dark Guardian and Seattle&apos;s Mr. Raven Blade. They say Phoenix is not as brave as he likes people to believe, that he&apos;s in it for personal gain, and that his presence on the streets only serves to escalate matters. To support this last criticism, they cite the Taco Incident.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1h"> Phoenix sighs. &quot;It was a drunk driver. He was getting into his car, so I tried to give him a taco and some water to sober him up. He didn&apos;t want it. Eventually he got kind of violent. He tried to shove me. So I pulled out my Taser, and I fired some warning shots. Then the police showed up....&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1i"> &quot;I didn&apos;t realize he was a drunk driver,&quot; I said. &quot;The other superheroes implied it was just a regular random guy you were trying to force a taco onto. But still&#x2014;&quot; I gesture at the nearby crack dealers&#x2014;&quot;the Taco Incident surely demonstrates how things can inadvertently spiral.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1j"> &quot;They&apos;re in my house,&quot; he resolutely replies. &quot;Any corner where people go, that&apos;s my corner. And I&apos;m going to defend it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1k"> We walk slowly past the bus stop. Nothing happens. Everyone just mutters angrily at one another.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1l"> It is now 5 a.m. Our first night&apos;s patrolling together ends. I&apos;m glad, as I found that last part a little frightening. I am not a naturally confrontational person, and I&apos;d really like to check into my hotel and go to bed.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1m">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1n"> The real-life-superhero movement began, the folklore goes, back in 1980, when someone by the name of the Night Rider published a book called <em>How to Be a Superhero</em>. But the phenomenon really took hold a few years later when a young man from New Orleans (whose true identity is still a closely guarded secret) built a silver suit, called himself Master Legend, and stepped out onto the streets. He was an influential if erratic inspiration to those that followed.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1o"> &quot;Ninety percent of us think Master Legend is crazy,&quot; Phoenix told me. &quot;He&apos;s always drinking. He believes he was born wearing a purple veil and has died three times. But he does great deeds of heroism. He once saw someone try to rape a girl, and he beat the guy so severely he ended up in a hospital for almost a month. He&apos;s an enigma.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1p"> So what happened next? How did the RLSH movement grow from one visionary in Louisiana to 200 crusaders and counting? Well, the rise of the mega-comic conventions has certainly helped. I remember a friend, the film director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World), returning from his first San Diego Comic Con saucer-eyed with tales of hitherto reclusive geeks wandering around in elaborate homemade costumes, their heads held high. &quot;It was like Geek Pride,&quot; he said.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1q"> The community continued to blossom post-September 11 and especially during the recession of the past few years. Inspired by real-life-superhero comic books like <em>Watchmen</em> and <em>Kick-Ass</em>, both of which became movies, RLSHs have been cropping up all over the place. There&apos;s no national convention or gathering, but Peter Tangen is doing all he can to make them a cohesive community with a robust online presence.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1r"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558302ac09f0bee56440dc78/master/w_768/entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-pitch-black.jpg" alt="entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-pitch-black.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;t=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-pitch-black.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;t=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-pitch-black.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558302ac09f0bee56440dc78%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-pitch-black.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-pitch-black.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558302ac09f0bee56440dc78%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-pitch-black.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-pitch-black.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1s"> Tangen&apos;s origin story is as remarkable as any of the RLSHs&apos;. By day he&apos;s a Hollywood studio photographer, responsible for a great many movie posters&#x2014;<em>Spider-Man, Batman Begins, Thor, Hellboy, Fantastic Four</em>. But he&apos;s always felt like a cog in the machine. &quot;I&apos;m one of those guys who toils in obscurity,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody knows my name, because you don&apos;t get credit on a movie poster.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1t"> When he learned there were people doing in real life what the likes of Tobey Maguire and Christian Bale pretend to do on a film set, it inspired him. So he approached the RLSHs, offering to photograph them in heroic, unironic poses. His hope is to make them seem valiant and worthy of respect, not just the goofy story about the crazy nerd at the end of the local newscast. His portraits are all displayed on his website, The Real Life Super Hero Project. The site has become Peter&apos;s calling in life&#x2014;his attempt to be, like the men he celebrates, exceptional.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1u">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1v"> The morning after my first night with Phoenix, I have coffee at a downtown Seattle caf&#xE9; with Knight Owl, a former graphic designer who joined the movement because &quot;I wanted something more with my life.&quot; He tells me about common rookie mistakes, such as adopting a superhero name that&apos;s already in use. &quot;It&apos;s a general faux pas&#x2014;anything with the words <em>night, shadow, phanto</em>m... Those dark-vigilante-type-sounding names tend to get snapped up pretty fast.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1w"> &quot;Have there been any other Knight Owls?&quot; I ask.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1x"> &quot;There was an Owl,&quot; he says. &quot;The Owl. But he ended up changing his name to Scar Heart, since he&apos;d had a heart transplant.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1y"> He says he chose his name before he knew there was a Nite Owl in the <em>Watchmen</em> comic, so when people online tell him, &quot;You&apos;re a fucking pussy, and by the way, Knight Owl&apos;s taken&#x2014;haven&apos;t you seen <em>Watchmen</em>?&quot; they don&apos;t know what they&apos;re talking about.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.1z"> The second rookie mistake is to &quot;get caught up in the paraphernalia. People should think more about the functionality.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.20"> &quot;I assume capes aren&apos;t functional,&quot; I say, &quot;because they can get snagged on things.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.21"> &quot;If you&apos;re going to do some serious crime fighting, there&apos;d better be a good reason for a cape,&quot; he nods. &quot;And grappling hooks&#x2014;no, no, no, no, no!

You&apos;re not going to have enough distance for the parachute to even <em>open</em>.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.22"> Knight Owl seems to regard Phoenix as the real thing in a community rife with wannabes. That&apos;s how Phoenix sees himself, too. When I asked him why he seems to be capturing the public&apos;s imagination in a way that the other RLSHs haven&apos;t, he attributes it to his bravery. Others, he says, talk the talk but in reality just hand out food to the homeless and would probably run shrieking from danger if they ever chanced upon it.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.23"> &quot;When you wake up one day and decide to put on spandex and give out sandwiches, something&apos;s a little off,&quot; Phoenix says. &quot;I call them real-life sandwich handlers.&quot;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.24"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558302ad09f0bee56440dc89/master/w_768/entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-mr-xtreme.jpg" alt="entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-mr-xtreme.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;t=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-mr-xtreme.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;t=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-mr-xtreme.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558302ad09f0bee56440dc89%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-mr-xtreme.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-mr-xtreme.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558302ad09f0bee56440dc89%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-mr-xtreme.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-mr-xtreme.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.25"> I want to see another superhero operation to compare to Phoenix, so I fly to San Diego to meet Mr. Xtreme. He&apos;s been patrolling since 2006, the past eight months with his prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;, Urban Avenger. They pick me up at 9 p.m. outside my hotel. Both are heavily costumed. Mr. Xtreme is a thickset man&#x2014;a security guard by day&#x2014;wearing a green-and-black cape, a bulletproof vest, a green helmet, and a visor upon which fake eyes have been eerily painted. His outfit is covered with stickers of a woman&apos;s face: Kitty Genovese. In March 1964, in an infamous incident that shamed New York City, Genovese was stabbed near her apartment in Kew Gardens, Queens. Her attacker ran away. During the next half hour, several of her neighbors saw her or heard her screaming and did nothing. Then her attacker returned and killed her. She has become a talisman for the RLSH movement.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.26"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558302ac09f0bee56440dc82/master/w_768/entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-urban-avenger.jpg" alt="entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-urban-avenger.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;t=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-urban-avenger.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;t=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-urban-avenger.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558302ac09f0bee56440dc82%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-urban-avenger.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-urban-avenger.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558302ac09f0bee56440dc82%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-urban-avenger.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-urban-avenger.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.27"> You cannot see an inch of Urban Avenger&apos;s body. He&apos;s wearing a weird customized gas mask, green-tinted sunglasses, a red full-length hoodie, and long black leather gloves. Underneath it all he looks quite small and skinny. He says he&apos;s in his late twenties, has children, and works &quot;in the food-service industry.&quot; That&apos;s all he&apos;ll reveal to me.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.28"> He says he loves being covered from head to toe. &quot;When I wear this, I don&apos;t have to react to you in any way. Nobody knows what I&apos;m thinking or feeling. It&apos;s great. I can be in my own little world in here.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.29"> &quot;I know <em>exactly</em> what you mean,&quot; I say. &quot;I was once at a Halloween party and I didn&apos;t take off my mask all night. It completely eliminated all social anxiety.&quot; &quot;Sometimes I wish I never had to take the mask off,&quot; says Urban Avenger.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2a"> We begin our patrol through the clean, well-to-do streets of downtown San Diego. We pass bars and clubs filled with polite-looking young drinkers. A few take pictures of the superheroes on their phones. Others yell, &quot;It isn&apos;t Halloween anymore!&quot; from car windows. Urban Avenger says he doesn&apos;t understand how Phoenix is forever chancing upon crimes being committed. He&apos;s just <em>lucky</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2b"> &quot;What are the odds?&quot; he sighs. &quot;I almost never see <em>anything</em>.&quot; He pauses. &quot;Last October we got involved in breaking up some street fights.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2c"> &quot;Five months ago?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2d"> &quot;It&apos;s been really quiet around here ever since.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2e"> He says Phoenix is fortunate to have the scary district of Belltown on his doorstep. &quot;Google &apos;gunshots in Belltown&apos; and you&apos;ll come up with a hundred stories of gunshots being fired in, like, the last <em>year</em>,&quot; he says wistfully.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2f"> Some boys pass us. &quot;Want some reefer? Ganga? Weed?&quot; they say, sotto voce.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2g"> &quot;No,&quot; says Urban Avenger, walking quickly on.

For all his na&#xEF;vet&#xE9;, there&apos;s something infectiously upbeat about him. He&apos;s forever cheerful and positive and energetic. I ask him if he&apos;s addicted to crime fighting, and he says, &quot;I guess you could put it in the addiction category. It&apos;s the highlight of my day. Addictions are normally detrimental to health. This is detrimental to my health.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2v"> He puts his positive spirit down to a stable home life: &quot;I&apos;ve been with my girlfriend since I was 16.

We&apos;re a small team tonight; Pitch Black and Ghost are Phoenix&apos;s only companions. The bars are closing, and drunk kids are piling onto the streets, but there&apos;s still a frustrating absence of crime. But then, from somewhere up the street, we hear a shout: <em>&quot;I&apos;m going to fuck you, bitch.&quot;</em></p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2x"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558302af09f0bee56440dc92/master/w_768/entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-ghost.jpg" alt="entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-ghost.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;t=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-ghost.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;t=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-ghost.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558302af09f0bee56440dc92%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-ghost.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-ghost.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Freal-life-superheroes-phoenix-jones&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558302af09f0bee56440dc92%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-ghost.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2011-08-superhero-article-ghost.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2y"> &quot;Let&apos;s go!&quot; yells Phoenix. He, Ghost, Pitch Black, and I start to run frantically toward the mystery commotion.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.2z"> &quot;It&apos;s the YouTube guy!&quot; a nearby teenager shouts delightedly. &quot;Can I get a picture?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.30"> Phoenix screeches to a halt. &quot;I&apos;ll be right with you guys!&quot; he calls to us.

Something else is evidently propelling them&#x2014;a touch of narcissism. It&apos;s an odd sort of narcissism, of course, when the narcissist disguises his face, but the lust for fame and glory is unmistakable. By the time Phoenix has had his picture taken, the potential criminal and victim are nowhere to be seen.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.33"> Two uneventful hours pass. By 3 a.m. we are losing hope. Phoenix is reduced to suggesting we rent a hotel room, phone some prostitutes, and ask them on their arrival if they need help escaping the web of prostitution.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.34"> &quot;I think the problem with the plan,&quot; I say, &quot;is if a prostitute turns up at a hotel room and sees three men in masks, she&apos;s not going to immediately think &apos;superhero.&apos; Plus, she may have to travel all the way across Seattle. It&apos;ll be an hour out of her night.&quot; They agree to abandon the idea.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.35"> Suddenly we notice a man across the street drop a small, clear bag on the ground at the feet of another man.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.36"> <em>&quot;Yahtzee!&quot;</em> yells Phoenix. He rushes across the road. &quot;What did you just drop?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.37"> &quot;Pretzels,&quot; says the man, picking the bag up and showing it to us.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.38"> There&apos;s a silence. &quot;Good,&quot; says Phoenix.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.39">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3a"> Our very last hope is Belltown. When we turn the corner into the district, everything changes. By day this place is nice: art galleries, bars, restaurants. It&apos;s just down the road from the famous Pike Place Market. But now, at 4 a.m., the two or three blocks in front of me look as menacing and desperate as the projects from The Wire. The dealers staring at us look nothing like the exhausted old crackheads from the bus stop. These are large gangs of wiry young men. They stand on every block. The police are nowhere to be seen. I take in the scene and instinctively take a small step backward.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3b"> &quot;There&apos;s a possibility we could get into a fight,&quot; whispers Pitch Black. &quot;If that happens, back off, okay?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3c"> <em>&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</em> a man calls from across the street, outside a shuttered-up liquor store.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3d"> &quot;Patrolling,&quot; Phoenix calls back. &quot;What are <em>you</em> doing?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3e"> He, Pitch Black, and Ghost walk toward him.

Innocent bystanders get shot here. Think about the bigger picture. You&apos;re putting your lives on the line. If you guys are in a casket, your mamas are going to be like, &apos;For <em>what?</em>&apos; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3k"> &quot;Don&apos;t be a hero,&quot; a third man adds. &quot;That superhero shit?

This is <em>real life</em>.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3l"> I am finding myself ostentatiously nodding at everything the crack dealers are saying, I suppose in the hope that if the shooting starts, they&apos;ll remember my nods and make an effort to shoot around me.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3m"> &quot;I appreciate the info,&quot; says Phoenix.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3n"> Suddenly the first guy takes a step forward and peers at Phoenix through his mask.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3o"> &quot;You&apos;re a <em>brother?</em>&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;re a <em>BROTHER</em> and you&apos;re out here looking like<em> THIS?</em> You&apos;ve got to be out of your fucking mind, man.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3p"> And then it all changes. &quot;I feel threatened right now,&quot; the guy says. &quot;You&apos;ve got ski masks on.

Is that you?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3q"> &quot;You don&apos;t have to be here,&quot; says Phoenix. &quot;You&apos;ve got choices.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3r"> &quot;I&apos;ve been in the system since I was 10 years old!&quot; he yells. &quot;I haven&apos;t got no choices!

While Phoenix and his crew stand here, they&apos;re losing all their business.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3y"> Phoenix points to two packs of cigarettes under the windshield wiper of a nearby car.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.3z"> &quot;Those are indications that you can buy here,&quot; he says. &quot;So I&apos;m going to take them off and annoy the crap out of them.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.40"> He scrunches the packets up and throws them onto the sidewalk.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.41"> At this, one of the gang heads toward us. If you were watching from across the road, it would seem as if he just wanders past, but in fact he whispers something as he does: <em>&quot;You keep staying on our block, we gonna have to show you what the burner do.&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.42"> &quot;Thank you, it&apos;s great meeting you,&quot; says Phoenix.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.43"> The man loops and rejoins the others.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.44"> The streets are deserted, and it&apos;s starting to feel exceedingly dangerous. It&apos;s just the dealers and their guns and us. But then, miraculously, a taxi passes. I flag it. The superheroes all have (supposedly) bulletproof vests. I have a cardigan. &quot;I&apos;ll give you $20 to just stay here,&quot; I say to the driver.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.45"> He looks around. &quot;No,&quot; he says.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.46"> &quot;Thirty dollars?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.47"> And then, suddenly, the whole gang, all nine of them, some with their hands down their trousers as if they&apos;re holding guns just under their waistlines, walk toward us. I can&apos;t see much of Phoenix under the suit, but I can see by the way his hands are shaking that he is terrified.</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.48"> &quot;My shift is over,&quot; calls the taxi driver. &quot;I need to go home now.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.49"> &quot;Forty dollars!&quot; I yell. &quot;Just <em>stay there!</em>&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.4a"> <em>&quot;I don&apos;t care about the money!&quot;</em> the driver yells.

You guys are dumb motherfuckers. I don&apos;t even know what to say. You guys are <em>fucking stupid</em>.&quot; He stares at Phoenix. A moment passes. This is what I imagine a standoff feels like the instant before the shooting starts. But then his voice softens. &quot;If you guys are going to stand here and die for it, I guess we&apos;re going to have to walk home. We should shoot your ass, but I guess we&apos;ve got to go home.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1yr84066znk.1.1.0.0.4.4g"> And they do. They disperse.
