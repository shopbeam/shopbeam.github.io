In 2006 he signed a massive, history-making deal with the Giants, only to lose control, inexplicably, of his celebrated 12-to-6 curveball. Since then he has been great only in short bursts: a month here, six games there. Now he personified something else in baseball: the mega-contract bust. But last fall, with the Giants facing elimination in the playoffs, he saved their season and led them to their second World Series title in three years. Afterward, when teammates chanted his name, he broke down",

  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AEditor\u0027s note: This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\u000A\u000ADuring the second half of last season, your game dramatically improved. You halved the number of bases on balls you allowed, and you regained the downward break on your curveball, which was once the best in the league. How did you do this, and why weren\u0027t you able to do it sooner?\u000A\u000AThe nature of this game is that it\u0027s unpredictable and people will tend to bunch things up for the sake of their arguments. Like, in Oakland it was (A), in San Francisco it was (B) and in 2012 it was (C), you know what I mean? But it hasn\u0027t been that black and white, unfortunately. I\u0027ve had a lot of good spurts in San Francisco, but I think they were just less consistent than the spurts in Oakland. It just happened to be a good spurt.\u000A\u000ADo you have the sense that you can sustain what you did during the latter half of 2012?\u000A\u000AI have no idea. If I could predict the future, I\u0027d be going out and be buying some Lotto tickets right now. I just know I\u0027m gonna work as hard as I can and let the chips fall where they may.\u000A\u000AWhy do you think you became a different pitcher in San Francisco? To what degree did the huge contract you signed and the expectations attached to it mess with your head?\u000A\u000AGosh, it\u0027s tough because I don\u0027t wanna—I\u0027ve just done this so many times where I just don\u0027t like looking back. I don\u0027t like talking about the contract this and the A\u0027s that. You know what I mean? There\u0027s only so many times... Let\u0027s say your mom died, and all people want to do is, like, \u0022So, your mom died! So let\u0027s talk about it. So when she was alive, this, but then when she died, that, and you and that and...\u0022 At some point you\u0027re just like, \u0022Okay, can we talk about today, please?\u0022 But nobody wants to talk about today. And that\u0027s why I don\u0027t really do [interviews] anymore, because it just becomes this whole storyline. Of course you can\u0027t get mad at that, because there\u0027s baseball fans and blah blah and they want to hear it, and I get that; but for my own kind of just staying in the present moment, it doesn\u0027t serve me to keep turning over that shoulder and looking at that stuff. That may be what everyone wants to hear, so it\u0027s tough for me to kind of have interviews at this point, I guess, unless it\u0027s something that\u0027s really based around a certain subject matter.\u000A\u000ATo what degree are you a different person than the person you were in Oakland?\u000A\u000AI think I\u0027m a little bit less of a seeker these days. I\u0027ve found something that I just really love, which is the Christian faith, and it\u0027s new to me. I grew up being a seeker and being completely out of the box and testing and reading and trying all different religious things and kind of philosophical approaches and such, and it\u0027s kind of a backwards route. Most people are raised very rigidly in an organized religion and then they try to fight their way out of that. I needed structure [laughs]. A lot of these kind of spiritual things are all based on the self and that was just too—I couldn\u0027t handle that anymore. I don\u0027t know. I think it led to a form of—it can lead to narcissism, I think.\u000A\u000AWhen did you become a Christian?\u000A\u000AMiddle of 2011.\u000A\u000AYou got married at the end of that year. Was your wife an influence in your becoming a Christian?\u000A\u000AYes, she was raised Catholic, but she also became kind of a seeker as well, and so we both kind of found it within the same time frame.\u000A\u000AWhat led the two of you to this particular faith?\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s hard to pinpoint one thing, but I think a lot of pain, you know, a lot of tough times and basically a need for strength outside of myself.\u000A\u000ATo what degree were the struggles you\u0027ve had in San Francisco a part of what you were struggling with?\u000A\u000AI mean, that was a huge part of it. That was a huge part of the pain and struggle. I think when you experience tough times, I think it\u0027s difficult enough, but when you experience those things in public, you know, on stage, so to speak, it becomes exponentially more difficult. Because now everyone has a say in what they think you should do instead of it just being a couple of your friends. It\u0027s hard to kind of get into the depths of the emotion at the low points, because I\u0027m not there, so now I can only speak of it as an outsider, and I can\u0027t really do it justice.\u000A\u000AWhat are you reading these days?\u000A\u000AI read a lot of C.S. Lewis these days.\u000A\u000AThe explicitly religious stuff or The Chronicles of Narnia?\u000A\u000AI just got through with one called The Problem of Pain. A lot of people routinely ask the question, how can pain and suffering be a part of the world if God is good? The way that he formulates his response is incredible. It\u0027s just basically that if in fact we have free will we can choose to do things all over the gamut—good, bad, painful, fulfilling, things leading to joy and things leading to sadness—so it\u0027s kind of inherent in the system of free will. It seems very logical to me.\u000A\u000AIs the person you were in Oakland—the sort of free-spirited guy who was into meditation and surfing and Zen and guitar—compatible with the Barry Zito who has become a Christian? Or would you say that you\u0027ve changed?\u000A\u000AI think that people hear things about religion and they fly off the handle and they get so [laughs] caught up in all these things but essentially it\u0027s a set of morals, you know? So I don\u0027t know how to answer that. I love music, I love surfing, I love yoga. It\u0027s either/or for people, and it sounds like you might feel that same way, possibly that you can either be Christian or you can be into yoga. You know what I mean? You can be Christian or you can be, like, an exciting person that\u0027s spontaneous. [laughs] I don\u0027t know. I get a little upset with the stereotypes out there, you know what I mean?\u000A\u000AThe Christian ballplayers I\u0027ve encountered have tended to be fairly conservative people socially and politically. That\u0027s where my question is coming from. During your time in Oakland, the media portrayed you as the reigning flaky lefty—the Bill Lee of your generation. I wondered whether that\u0027s the person you still are, if in fact that\u0027s the person you ever were.\u000A\u000AYou also have to understand that these are snippets. These are people getting five minutes with me or seeing something and then instantly they say \u0022Bill Lee.\u0022 Things like \u0022flaky,\u0022 things like \u0022hippie\u0022: when I hear those things, my image is something completely different than the person that I set out to be every day of my life including ten, fifteen years ago. Little catchphrases like that will stick to a player and unfortunately things like that have stuck with me. Anyone that knows me, they look at that stuff and they\u0027re just like, \u0022What are these people talking about?\u0022 So it\u0027s just hard to comment on the impression or the interpretation of my own life through someone else\u0027s lens that doesn\u0027t even know me, essentially.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027ve been written about a great deal, as you pointed out. But is there anything you\u0027re interested in that we don\u0027t know about?\u000A\u000ALet\u0027s see. I\u0027ve kind of picked up a new hobby of shooting firearms. So that\u0027s something that I\u0027ve really gotten excited about lately. I think when you have a family and you understand that you have so much to lose if some lunatic is gonna come off the street and try to do something in your home, it makes you feel a little better to know that I\u0027ll be able to defend my family. It\u0027s a utilitarian thing. That\u0027s basically what it\u0027s about.\u000A\u000AHave you been exposed to any kind of threats?\u000A\u000AUm, let\u0027s just say there was a good reason why we got into that, you know? It\u0027s all out of necessity, so sometimes things present themselves and you have to make adjustments in life, you know what I mean?\u000A\u000AAbout a month ago, while I was on the phone, a guy broke into my apartment. Since then I\u0027ve been sleeping with a baseball bat by my bed.\u000A\u000AA baseball bat\u0027s probably not gonna get it done, dude. I hate to tell you, because if homeboy\u0027s got a gun.... Yeah, man, it\u0027s not a safe world out there, dude.",

his prime years with the Oakland Athletics, Barry Zito won the Cy Young, dated Alyssa Milano, surfed, played guitar, meditated, and generally personified that beloved baseball archetype: the flaky lefty. In 2006 he signed a massive, history-making deal with the Giants, only to lose control, inexplicably, of his celebrated 12-to-6 curveball. Since then he has been great only in short bursts: a month here, six games there. Now he personified something else in baseball: the mega-contract bust. But last fall, with the Giants facing elimination in the playoffs, he saved their season and led them to their second World Series title in three years. Afterward, when teammates chanted his name, he broke down</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.0"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55831a7209f0bee564411f9a/master/w_806/style-2013-05-outta-the-park-barry-zito.jpg" alt="style-2013-05-outta-the-park-barry-zito.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbarry-zito-q-a&amp;t=style-2013-05-outta-the-park-barry-zito.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbarry-zito-q-a&amp;t=style-2013-05-outta-the-park-barry-zito.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbarry-zito-q-a&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55831a7209f0bee564411f9a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2013-05-outta-the-park-barry-zito.jpg&amp;description=style-2013-05-outta-the-park-barry-zito.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fbarry-zito-q-a&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55831a7209f0bee564411f9a%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fstyle-2013-05-outta-the-park-barry-zito.jpg&amp;description=style-2013-05-outta-the-park-barry-zito.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.1"><em>Editor&apos;s note: This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</em></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>During the second half of last season, your game dramatically improved. You halved the number of bases on balls you allowed, and you regained the downward break on your curveball, which was once the best in the league. How did you do this, and why weren&apos;t you able to do it sooner?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.3">The nature of this game is that it&apos;s unpredictable and people will tend to bunch things up for the sake of their arguments. Like, in Oakland it was (A), in San Francisco it was (B) and in 2012 it was (C), you know what I mean? But it hasn&apos;t been that black and white, unfortunately. I&apos;ve had a lot of good spurts in San Francisco, but I think they were just less consistent than the spurts in Oakland. It just happened to be a good spurt.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>Do you have the sense that you can sustain what you did during the latter half of 2012?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.6">I have no idea. If I could predict the future, I&apos;d be going out and be buying some Lotto tickets right now. I just know I&apos;m gonna work as hard as I can and let the chips fall where they may.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Why do you think you became a different pitcher in San Francisco? To what degree did the huge contract you signed and the expectations attached to it mess with your head?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.8">Gosh, it&apos;s tough because I don&apos;t wanna&#x2014;I&apos;ve just done this so many times where I just don&apos;t like looking back. I don&apos;t like talking about the contract this and the A&apos;s that. You know what I mean? There&apos;s only so many times... Let&apos;s say your mom died, and all people want to do is, like, &quot;So, your mom died! So let&apos;s talk about it. So when she was alive, this, but then when she died, that, and you and that and...&quot; At some point you&apos;re just like, &quot;Okay, can we talk about today, please?&quot; But nobody wants to talk about today. And that&apos;s why I don&apos;t really do [interviews] anymore, because it just becomes this whole storyline. Of course you can&apos;t get mad at that, because there&apos;s baseball fans and blah blah and they want to hear it, and I get that; but for my own kind of just staying in the present moment, it doesn&apos;t serve me to keep turning over that shoulder and looking at that stuff. That may be what everyone wants to hear, so it&apos;s tough for me to kind of have interviews at this point, I guess, unless it&apos;s something that&apos;s really based around a certain subject matter.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>To what degree are you a different person than the person you were in Oakland?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.a">I think I&apos;m a little bit less of a seeker these days. I&apos;ve found something that I just really love, which is the Christian faith, and it&apos;s new to me. I grew up being a seeker and being completely out of the box and testing and reading and trying all different religious things and kind of philosophical approaches and such, and it&apos;s kind of a backwards route. Most people are raised very rigidly in an organized religion and then they try to fight their way out of that. I needed structure <em>[laughs]</em>. A lot of these kind of spiritual things are all based on the self and that was just too&#x2014;I couldn&apos;t handle that anymore. I don&apos;t know. I think it led to a form of&#x2014;it can lead to narcissism, I think.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>When did you become a Christian?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.c">Middle of 2011.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>You got married at the end of that year. Was your wife an influence in your becoming a Christian?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.e">Yes, she was raised Catholic, but she also became kind of a seeker as well, and so we both kind of found it within the same time frame.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>What led the two of you to this particular faith?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.g">It&apos;s hard to pinpoint one thing, but I think a lot of pain, you know, a lot of tough times and basically a need for strength outside of myself.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>To what degree were the struggles you&apos;ve had in San Francisco a part of what you were struggling with?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.i">I mean, that was a huge part of it. That was a huge part of the pain and struggle. I think when you experience tough times, I think it&apos;s difficult enough, but when you experience those things in public, you know, on stage, so to speak, it becomes exponentially more difficult. Because now everyone has a say in what they think you should do instead of it just being a couple of your friends. It&apos;s hard to kind of get into the depths of the emotion at the low points, because I&apos;m not there, so now I can only speak of it as an outsider, and I can&apos;t really do it justice.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>What are you reading these days?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.k">I read a lot of C.S. Lewis these days.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>The explicitly religious stuff or <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.m">I just got through with one called <em>The Problem of Pain</em>. A lot of people routinely ask the question, how can pain and suffering be a part of the world if God is good? The way that he formulates his response is incredible. It&apos;s just basically that if in fact we have free will we can choose to do things all over the gamut&#x2014;good, bad, painful, fulfilling, things leading to joy and things leading to sadness&#x2014;so it&apos;s kind of inherent in the system of free will. It seems very logical to me.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>Is the person you were in Oakland&#x2014;the sort of free-spirited guy who was into meditation and surfing and Zen and guitar&#x2014;compatible with the Barry Zito who has become a Christian? Or would you say that you&apos;ve changed?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.o">I think that people hear things about religion and they fly off the handle and they get so <em>[laughs]</em> caught up in all these things but essentially it&apos;s a set of morals, you know? So I don&apos;t know how to answer that. I love music, I love surfing, I love yoga. It&apos;s either/or for people, and it sounds like you might feel that same way, possibly that you can either be Christian or you can be into yoga. You know what I mean? You can be Christian or you can be, like, an exciting person that&apos;s spontaneous. <em>[laughs] </em>I don&apos;t know. I get a little upset with the stereotypes out there, you know what I mean?</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>The Christian ballplayers I&apos;ve encountered have tended to be fairly conservative people socially and politically. That&apos;s where my question is coming from. During your time in Oakland, the media portrayed you as the reigning flaky lefty&#x2014;the Bill Lee of your generation. I wondered whether that&apos;s the person you still are, if in fact that&apos;s the person you ever were.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.q">You also have to understand that these are snippets. These are people getting five minutes with me or seeing something and then instantly they say &quot;Bill Lee.&quot; Things like &quot;flaky,&quot; things like &quot;hippie&quot;: when I hear those things, my image is something completely different than the person that I set out to be every day of my life including ten, fifteen years ago. Little catchphrases like that will stick to a player and unfortunately things like that have stuck with me. Anyone that knows me, they look at that stuff and they&apos;re just like, &quot;What are these people talking about?&quot; So it&apos;s just hard to comment on the impression or the interpretation of my own life through someone else&apos;s lens that doesn&apos;t even know me, essentially.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>You&apos;ve been written about a great deal, as you pointed out. But is there anything you&apos;re interested in that we don&apos;t know about?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.s">Let&apos;s see. I&apos;ve kind of picked up a new hobby of shooting firearms. So that&apos;s something that I&apos;ve really gotten excited about lately. I think when you have a family and you understand that you have so much to lose if some lunatic is gonna come off the street and try to do something in your home, it makes you feel a little better to know that I&apos;ll be able to defend my family. It&apos;s a utilitarian thing. That&apos;s basically what it&apos;s about.</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>Have you been exposed to any kind of threats?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.u">Um, let&apos;s just say there was a good reason why we got into that, you know? It&apos;s all out of necessity, so sometimes things present themselves and you have to make adjustments in life, you know what I mean?</p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>About a month ago, while I was on the phone, a guy broke into my apartment. Since then I&apos;ve been sleeping with a baseball bat by my bed.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.4.w">A baseball bat&apos;s probably not gonna get it done, dude. I hate to tell you, because if homeboy&apos;s got a gun.... Yeah, man, it&apos;s not a safe world out there, dude.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".wsme64o934.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col
