  	    "articleBody": "It looks as if Donald Trump has claimed his first victim: Scott Walker. While every Republican presidential candidate has struggled to adjust to the realization that the Summer of Trump is likely to extend into the fall, and possibly beyond, no one\u0027s botched his response to this development as badly as the Wisconsin governor.\u000A\u000AJust consider the issue of immigration. After Trump vowed to end birthright citizenship, the rest of the GOP field seemingly had two simple options: either endorse or reject Trump\u0027s call to repeal the Fourteenth Amendment. Walker, however, decided to set himself apart from his opponents by being the only candidate to embrace not just those two seemingly irreconcilable options, but also to stake out a third by insisting that he was \u0022not taking a position on it one way or the other.\u0022 (Which, considering that birthright citizenship is currently enshrined in the Constitution, is a bit like a presidential candidate saying he\u0027s neither for nor against freedom of speech.) As CNN straightforwardly headlined its account of Walker\u0027s birthright contortions: \u00223 positions, 7 days.\u0022\u000A\u000AIndeed, no GOP presidential candidate has been more negatively affected by Trump\u0027s rise than Walker, who emerged early this year as the man most likely to beat Jeb Bush. And while Bush\u0027s star has certainly faded since then, Walker\u0027s has fallen even further. After leading the polls for six months in Iowa—a state he has to win—Walker now trails not only Trump there but Ben Carson as well. He\u0027s suffered a similar slip in New Hampshire, where he\u0027s now in fourth place—the same position he holds in the RCP average of national polls. Last week, according to The Washington Post, Walker took the drastic step of reassuring his donors that he was essentially rebooting his campaign. The reassurances were apparently insufficient for one of Walker\u0027s biggest financial backers, Anthony Scaramucci, who, The Wall Street Journal reports, met with Trump on Monday. (Scaramucci told the Journal that he intends to stick with Walker; Trump told the Journal that Scaramucci wants to switch horses.)\u000A\u000AThat Trump\u0027s rise has come at the same time as Walker\u0027s fall is partly attributable to the fact that, to some extent, they\u0027re running in the same lane—trying to win over the GOP\u0027s conservative base; and also, as Chris Cillizza argues, that Walker is trying to appeal to both movement and establishment conservatives simultaneously. But Trump has done more than just steal like-minded potential voters (and donors) from Walker; he\u0027s exposed just what a weak candidate Walker actually is.\u000A\u000AEven before his birthright botch, Walker had executed what a former aide termed an \u0022Olympics-quality flip-flop\u0022 on immigration—abandoning his past support for providing undocumented immigrants with a pathway to citizenship and even endorsing new limits on legal immigration. But, in the same breath that he was making this very public reversal in the hope of winning over conservative voters, he was, according to The Wall Street Journal, privately reassuring immigration-friendly establishment Republicans that he hadn\u0027t changed his views. What\u0027s more, Walker didn\u0027t limit his flip-flops to immigration: He staked out new, more conservative positions on everything from abortion to Common Core; as well as a more Iowa-friendly stance on the Renewable Fuel Standard.\u000A\u000AThese sorts of policy reversals underscore the small-time, chintzy nature of Walker\u0027s campaign. Other examples abound. Seeking to portray himself as a tough-on-terror statesman, Walker declared himself ready to battle ISIS in the Middle East on the basis of his experience facing down angry lefty protestors in Wisconsin. He\u0027s betrayed a profound fear of the press—closing multiple events to reporters and screening their questions on conference calls. On Monday, as the U.S. stock market crashed in response to economic turmoil in China, Walker called on President Obama to cancel Chinese President Xi Jinping\u0027s upcoming state visit—a demand so stupid and unnecessarily provocative that it hadn\u0027t even occurred to Trump. It all adds up to a portrait of a candidate who just isn\u0027t ready for the national stage.\u000A\u000AOne common knock against Walker is that he\u0027s dumb, as evidenced by the fact that he didn\u0027t graduate from college. But that\u0027s too easy. After all, Walker dropped out of college to get an early start on his political career. And considering he was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly at the age of 22 and as Milwaukee County Executive when he was 34, before going on to become the thrice-elected governor of his state, that ended up being a pretty good decision. Walker\u0027s electoral success in Wisconsin is even more impressive when you consider that he\u0027s long served as his own political strategist.\u000A\u000ABut piloting yourself to the top of the political heap in your home state—even if it\u0027s a swing state with 10 electoral votes—is a far cry from running for president. And that\u0027s a reality that Walker is now learning. As one plugged-in GOP political operative put it to me when I asked about Walker\u0027s current campaign, \u0022It looks like the Milwaukee County Executive is running for president.\u0022 The only thing surprising about that realization is that it took a real estate mogul turned reality-TV star turned politician to make it so clear.\u000A\u000AJason Zengerle is GQ\u0027s Political Correspondent",

As CNN straightforwardly headlined its account of Walker&#x2019;s birthright contortions: &#x201C;<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/23/politics/scott-walker-donald-trump-birthright-citizenship-2016/index.html">3 positions, 7 days.</a>&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".113r96hih34.1.1.0.0.4.2">Indeed, no GOP presidential candidate has been more negatively affected by Trump&#x2019;s rise than Walker, who emerged early this year as the <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/the-battle-between-scott-walker-and-jeb-bush-is-underway-20150305">man most likely</a> to beat Jeb Bush. And while Bush&#x2019;s star has certainly faded since then, Walker&#x2019;s has fallen even further. After leading the polls for six months in Iowa&#x2014;a state he has to win&#x2014;Walker <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_republican_presidential_caucus-3194.html">now trails</a> not only Trump there but Ben Carson as well. He&#x2019;s suffered a similar slip in New Hampshire, where he&#x2019;s now in <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_republican_presidential_primary-3350.html">fourth place</a>&#x2014;the same position he holds in the <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html">RCP average of national polls</a>. Last week, according to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fading-in-the-polls-scott-walker-aims-to-attract-trump-voters/2015/08/18/48d0b900-45ab-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, Walker took the drastic step of reassuring his donors that he was essentially rebooting his campaign. The reassurances were apparently insufficient for one of Walker&#x2019;s biggest financial backers, Anthony Scaramucci, who, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-top-walker-fundraiser-meets-with-trump-1440450463">reports</a>, met with Trump on Monday. (Scaramucci told the <em>Journal</em> that he intends to stick with Walker; Trump told the <em>Journal</em> that Scaramucci wants to switch horses.)</p><p data-reactid=".113r96hih34.1.1.0.0.4.3">That Trump&#x2019;s rise has come at the same time as Walker&#x2019;s fall is partly attributable to the fact that, to some extent, they&#x2019;re running in the same lane&#x2014;trying to win over the GOP&#x2019;s conservative base; and also, as Chris Cillizza <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/08/24/what-scott-walkers-shaky-answers-on-the-14th-amendment-tell-us-about-his-candidacy-hint-its-not-good/?postshare=7801440427441521">argues</a>, that Walker is trying to appeal to both movement and establishment conservatives simultaneously. But Trump has done more than just steal like-minded potential voters (and donors) from Walker; he&#x2019;s exposed just what a weak candidate Walker actually is.</p><p data-reactid=".113r96hih34.1.1.0.0.4.5">Even before his birthright botch, Walker had executed what a former aide termed an <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/scott-walker-immigration-stance-flip-flop-117192.html">&#x201C;Olympics-quality flip-flop&#x201D;</a> on immigration&#x2014;abandoning his past support for providing undocumented immigrants with a pathway to citizenship and even endorsing new limits on legal immigration. But, in the same breath that he was making this very public reversal in the hope of winning over conservative voters, he was, according to <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/walker-backs-path-to-citizenship-at-private-new-hampshire-dinner-1427390295"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, privately reassuring immigration-friendly establishment Republicans that he hadn&#x2019;t changed his views. What&#x2019;s more, Walker <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/04/07/scott-walker-has-record-position-changes-major-issues-creating-potential-drag-gop-primary-candidacy/3YaLLJj2qr6ZOykF5zGfVK/story.html">didn&#x2019;t limit his flip-flops</a> to immigration: He staked out new, more conservative positions on everything from abortion to Common Core; as well as a more Iowa-friendly stance on the Renewable Fuel Standard.</p><p data-reactid=".113r96hih34.1.1.0.0.4.6">These sorts of policy reversals underscore the small-time, chintzy nature of Walker&#x2019;s campaign. Other examples abound. Seeking to portray himself as a tough-on-terror statesman, Walker <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/414512/scott-walkers-awful-answer-isis">declared himself ready to battle ISIS</a> in the Middle East on the basis of his experience facing down angry lefty protestors in Wisconsin. He&#x2019;s betrayed a <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/08/scott-walker-campaign-screens-reporters-questions-212564.html">profound fear of the press</a>&#x2014;closing multiple events to reporters and screening their questions on conference calls. On Monday, as the U.S. stock market crashed in response to economic turmoil in China, Walker <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/24/scott-walker-obama-should-show-some-backbone-by-canceling-chinese-state-visit/">called on President Obama</a> to cancel Chinese President Xi Jinping&#x2019;s upcoming state visit&#x2014;a demand so stupid and unnecessarily provocative that it hadn&#x2019;t even occurred to Trump. It all adds up to a portrait of a candidate who just isn&#x2019;t ready for the national stage.</p><p data-reactid=".113r96hih34.1.1.0.0.4.7">One common knock against Walker is that he&#x2019;s dumb, as evidenced by the fact that he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/01/08/scott-walker-has-no-college-degree-thats-normal-for-an-american-but-not-a-president/">didn&#x2019;t graduate from college</a>. But that&#x2019;s too easy. After all, Walker dropped out of college to get an <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/why-scott-walker-didnt-graduate-college_850029.html">early start</a> on his political career. And considering he was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly at the age of 22 and as Milwaukee County Executive when he was 34, before going on to become the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-walker-wins-wisconsin-recall-election/">thrice-elected</a> governor of his state, that ended up being a pretty good decision. Walker&#x2019;s electoral success in Wisconsin is even more impressive when you consider that he&#x2019;s long served as <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-walker-wins-wisconsin-recall-election/">his own political strategist</a>.</p><p data-reactid=".113r96hih34.1.1.0.0.4.8">But piloting yourself to the top of the political heap in your home state&#x2014;even if it&#x2019;s a swing state with 10 electoral votes&#x2014;is a far cry from running for president. And that&#x2019;s a reality that Walker is now learning. As one plugged-in GOP political operative put it to me when I asked about Walker&#x2019;s current campaign, &#x201C;It looks like the Milwaukee County Executive is running for president.&#x201D; The only thing surprising about that realization is that it took a real estate mogul turned reality-TV star turned politician to make it so clear.</p><p data-reactid=".113r96hih34.1.1.0.0.4.9"><em>Jason
