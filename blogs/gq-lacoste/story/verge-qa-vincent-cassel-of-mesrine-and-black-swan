  	    "articleBody": "Vincent Cassel is about to blow up in America, and it\u0027s about time. We caught up with French Badass No. 1 (you might remember him as the bad guy in Ocean\u0027s Twelve) at the Mercer Hotel and talked about his upcoming gangster films Mesrine: Killer Instinct (which opens August 27th) and Mesrine: Public Enemy No. 1, as well as the upcoming Darren Aronofsky-directed Black Swan, in which he stars as an NYC ballet director alongside Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AIn Mesrine, some characters pronounce it \u0022Mez-reen\u0022 and others \u0022May-reen\u0022. What\u0027s with that?\u000A\u000AActually, you shouldn\u0027t pronounce the \u0022s,\u0022 it\u0027s not the way you\u0027re supposed to say it, but it became almost a sign of recognition. People who don\u0027t like him pronounce the \u0022s\u0022 because they know he hates it, and then the people who are true to him, they just pronounce it the way it should be, like \u0022May-reen.\u0022 Jacques Mesrine.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AYour Mesrine films are being compared to Scarface. What do you think about that comparison?\u000A\u000AWell, I love Scarface, so why not? Thanks for the compliment. But altogether, I think they\u0027re pretty different, really. It\u0027s the story the rise and fall of a gangster, but it has nothing to do with drugs, and more than anything else, Scarface didn\u0027t exist, and Mesrine did. So actually everything you\u0027ve seen in the movie, even though it\u0027s totally crazy and unbelievable, really happened. That makes the most important difference, I think.\u000A\u000AA lot of Americans still know you as \u0022that French guy from Ocean\u0027s Twelve.\u0022\u000A\u000AYeah, of course, that\u0027s the biggest thing I did, really.\u000A\u000ABut you have Black Swan coming out. Are you playing more of a leading role in that?\u000A\u000AWell, the main character in Black Swan is definitely Natalie Portman. It\u0027s about her and her character becoming crazy, but I\u0027m very present in it, definitely.\u000A\u000AAre you the villain?\u000A\u000ANo, not really actually. He\u0027s a pretty tough character because he\u0027s a true artist and he\u0027s really pushing her to her limits, but no, he doesn\u0027t kill anybody. It\u0027s just that he\u0027s a very rough choreographer, like most of the good ones are.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re playing a New York City ballet company director. Do you have any background in dance?\u000A\u000ATotally, that\u0027s how I started. I started at the circus school, I took ballet for like six years, every day. So I had a pretty intense dancing background for a while. I don\u0027t practice anymore, but I feel like as an actor, the fact that I did that for so long gave me a certain kind of physicality that I can use even in, let\u0027s say, a normal role.\u000A\u000AHow was it to work with Darren Aronofsky? \u000A\u000AYou see, it\u0027s very strange because this guy\u0027s from Brooklyn, and I felt like we had a lot in common, really, you know? We\u0027re the same age, we grew up listening to the same kind of music, and so suddenly to get involved with him was very simple. And how he cast me was very simple. He called my agent, he was in London, and he said, \u0022Would Vincent come to London to meet me?\u0022 And I was actually already in London. So I said, \u0022But I am!\u0022 And then half an hour later we were in a café, talking about the character, and then the week after that I was hired.\u000A\u000AIn 2002 you and your wife Monica Bellucci starred in one of the most controversial films of the last decade, Irreversible. \u000A\u000AIt\u0027s very rough. But I think it\u0027s a classic, honestly. And more than that, I think Gaspar Noé is one of the best directors today, period. It\u0027s not for everybody—it\u0027s not commercial, definitely—but the movie\u0027s been released all over the world, it\u0027s been in hundreds of festivals, and everywhere I go people tell me about Irreversible. It\u0027s like the ultimate horror movie, except that it\u0027s real.\u000A\u000AHow was it working with Noé?\u000A\u000AWell, Noé is one of those guys I\u0027ve been seeing for years before I started to work with him. I would see him all the time at night, in Paris. Partying, really. And that\u0027s how he actually proposed me the movie. Five o\u0027clock in the morning, we\u0027d had a bit of, a little drunk, and he came to say, \u0022Hey, would you like to make a movie with explicit sex scenes with you and your wife?\u0022 \u0022Come on, Gaspar, what the hell are you talking about? No, of course not.\u0022 And then I came back to him and said, \u0022What do you mean by that?\u0022 And then we realized that was impossible to do explicit sex scenes. I mean, I didn\u0027t feel like it, for sure. But then it became something else, and it became that movie, which is a story of revenge, and plus acting with my wife again, knowing that we made... I don\u0027t even remember how many movies we\u0027ve shot together, but something like nine? You know, we just did it.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ADo you prefer acting in American movies or French movies?\u000A\u000AHonestly, I think the nationality has nothing to do with it. It\u0027s all about the director, really. And that\u0027s what makes the difference. What I like to be in is movies with personality, and something original—it can be from anywhere. I shot a movie in Brazil last year, I just shot a movie in Spain, Darren is definitely American even though it\u0027s not typical American kind of movies, Cronenberg is Canadian, you know, it\u0027s all different really. So I think the idea of saying that you have American cinema, and then you have foreign cinema, it doesn\u0027t really mean anything. It\u0027s a stereotype.\u000A\u000AWhat do you miss most about France when you\u0027re here, and what do you miss most about the States when you\u0027re in France?\u000A\u000AWhat I miss the most of France when I\u0027m away is my friends and my family, more than anything else. What I miss about New York when I\u0027m away is the energy. There\u0027s definitely something here that you can\u0027t find anywhere else. New York\u0027s definitely a part of my identity. I\u0027ve spent so much time here since I was a kid, really. So coming back to New York is always a little bit like coming home, too. And you know what, I didn\u0027t come back for a while because I was busy doing other things, and lately coming back here for the Aronofsky movie, and now for the release of Mesrine and everything, I feel like I could live again here for a little bit.",

What do you think about that comparison?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.7">Well, I love <em>Scarface</em>, so why not? Thanks for the compliment. But altogether, I think they&apos;re pretty different, really. It&apos;s the story the rise and fall of a gangster, but it has nothing to do with drugs, and more than anything else, Scarface didn&apos;t exist, and Mesrine did. So actually everything you&apos;ve seen in the movie, even though it&apos;s totally crazy and unbelievable, really happened. That makes the most important difference, I think.</p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>A lot of Americans still know you as &quot;that French guy from Ocean&apos;s Twelve.&quot;</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.9">Yeah, of course, that&apos;s the biggest thing I did, really.</p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>But you have <em>Black Swan</em> coming out. Are you playing more of a leading role in that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.b">Well, the main character in <em>Black Swan</em> is definitely Natalie Portman. It&apos;s about her and her character becoming crazy, but I&apos;m very present in it, definitely.</p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Are you the villain?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.d">No, not really actually. He&apos;s a pretty tough character because he&apos;s a true artist and he&apos;s really pushing her to her limits, but no, he doesn&apos;t kill anybody. It&apos;s just that he&apos;s a very rough choreographer, like most of the good ones are.</p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>You&apos;re playing a New York City ballet company director. Do you have any background in dance?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.f">Totally, that&apos;s how I started. I started at the circus school, I took ballet for like six years, every day. So I had a pretty intense dancing background for a while. I don&apos;t practice anymore, but I feel like as an actor, the fact that I did that for so long gave me a certain kind of physicality that I can use even in, let&apos;s say, a normal role.</p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>How was it to work with Darren Aronofsky? </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.h">You see, it&apos;s very strange because this guy&apos;s from Brooklyn, and I felt like we had a lot in common, really, you know? We&apos;re the same age, we grew up listening to the same kind of music, and so suddenly to get involved with him was very simple. And how he cast me was very simple. He called my agent, he was in London, and he said, &quot;Would Vincent come to London to meet me?&quot; And I was actually already in London. So I said, &quot;But I am!&quot; And then half an hour later we were in a caf&#xE9;, talking about the character, and then the week after that I was hired.</p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>In 2002 you and your wife Monica Bellucci starred in one of the most controversial films of the last decade, <em>Irreversible</em>. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.j">It&apos;s very rough. But I think it&apos;s a classic, honestly. And more than that, I think Gaspar No&#xE9; is one of the best directors today, period. It&apos;s not for everybody&#x2014;it&apos;s not commercial, definitely&#x2014;but the movie&apos;s been released all over the world, it&apos;s been in hundreds of festivals, and everywhere I go people tell me about Irreversible. It&apos;s like the ultimate horror movie, except that it&apos;s real.</p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>How was it working with No&#xE9;?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.l">Well, No&#xE9; is one of those guys I&apos;ve been seeing for years before I started to work with him. I would see him all the time at night, in Paris. Partying, really. And that&apos;s how he actually proposed me the movie. Five o&apos;clock in the morning, we&apos;d had a bit of, a little drunk, and he came to say, &quot;Hey, would you like to make a movie with explicit sex scenes with you and your wife?&quot; &quot;Come on, Gaspar, what the hell are you talking about? No, of course not.&quot; And then I came back to him and said, &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; And then we realized that was impossible to do explicit sex scenes. I mean, I didn&apos;t feel like it, for sure. But then it became something else, and it became that movie, which is a story of revenge, and plus acting with my wife again, knowing that we made... I don&apos;t even remember how many movies we&apos;ve shot together, but something like nine? You know, we just did it.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.m"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582968a1177d66d68d559f4/master/w_806/blogs-the-q-2010-08-09-mesrine3.jpg" alt="blogs-the-q-2010-08-09-mesrine3.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fverge-qa-vincent-cassel-of-mesrine-and-black-swan&amp;t=blogs-the-q-2010-08-09-mesrine3.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fverge-qa-vincent-cassel-of-mesrine-and-black-swan&amp;t=blogs-the-q-2010-08-09-mesrine3.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fverge-qa-vincent-cassel-of-mesrine-and-black-swan&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582968a1177d66d68d559f4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-q-2010-08-09-mesrine3.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-q-2010-08-09-mesrine3.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fverge-qa-vincent-cassel-of-mesrine-and-black-swan&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582968a1177d66d68d559f4%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-q-2010-08-09-mesrine3.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-q-2010-08-09-mesrine3.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>Do you prefer acting in American movies or French movies?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.o">Honestly, I think the nationality has nothing to do with it. It&apos;s all about the director, really. And that&apos;s what makes the difference. What I like to be in is movies with personality, and something original&#x2014;it can be from anywhere. I shot a movie in Brazil last year, I just shot a movie in Spain, Darren is definitely American even though it&apos;s not typical American kind of movies, Cronenberg is Canadian, you know, it&apos;s all different really. So I think the idea of saying that you have American cinema, and then you have foreign cinema, it doesn&apos;t really mean anything. It&apos;s a stereotype.</p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>What do you miss most about France when you&apos;re here, and what do you miss most about the States when you&apos;re in France?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.4.q">What I miss the most of France when I&apos;m away is my friends and my family, more than anything else. What I miss about New York when I&apos;m away is the energy. There&apos;s definitely something here that you can&apos;t find anywhere else. New York&apos;s definitely a part of my identity. I&apos;ve spent so much time here since I was a kid, really. So coming back to New York is always a little bit like coming home, too. And you know what, I didn&apos;t come back for a while because I was busy doing other things, and lately coming back here for the Aronofsky movie, and now for the release of <em>Mesrine</em> and everything, I feel like I could live again here for a little bit.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1nd4q44twxs.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div
