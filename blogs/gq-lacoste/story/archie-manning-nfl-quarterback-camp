  	    "articleBody": "It\u0027s early on the last day of the Manning Passing Academy, and hidden in a room under the bleachers of a small Louisiana stadium, former New Orleans Saints quarterback Archie Manning is telling a story. Current Saints head coach Sean Payton has just handed him an oversize ring marking his inclusion, years back, among the inaugural names lining the Superdome\u0027s Ring of Honor, spots reserved for the team\u0027s eternal greats.\u000A\u000A\u0022I speak every now and then. People rent out the Superdome,\u0022 he says, in his slow, sprawling drawl. He\u0027s wearing a green, long-sleeve camp T-shirt, emblazoned with \u002220th Year\u0022 under the letters MPA and tucked into khaki shorts. He\u0027s trim. His skin is red and his hair white. If you could see his legs behind the lectern, you\u0027d see swollen ankles. If you could see him walk, you\u0027d see a limp. He\u0027s 66.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m giving a speech. People are seated. I\u0027m doing a Q&amp;A,\u0022 he continues. \u0022And a lady says, ‘Why is your name up there?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AArchie smiles, deep in the stadium housing Manning Field, deep in the camp named after him, too, thinking about all those hits his body took long ago.\u000A\u000A\u0022I said, ‘Every Sunday afternoon, I was on my butt, looking.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AThe room shakes with laughter, coming from the 120 or so counselors—high school and small-college coaches; college quarterbacks like Mississippi State\u0027s Dak Prescott and Penn State\u0027s Christian Hackenberg; sons Peyton and Eli—and bouncing off walls lined with pictures from two decades of camps. There\u0027s a younger Colin Kaepernick. Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson, too. Former campers and counselors who\u0027ve done good—maybe too good, since one forced Archie\u0027s middle boy out of his old job and the other beat him in his first Super Bowl at his new one.\u000A\u000AHe doesn\u0027t say much else.\u000A\u000A\u0022We don\u0027t believe in a lot of speeches,\u0022 he tells me.\u000A\u000AThen the double doors of the staff\u0027s makeshift home base will open and the counselors will spread out across the fields of Nicholls State\u0027s campus. They\u0027ll meet roughly 1,200 campers for their last half-day of camp, before they get in their cars with Mom and Dad and go home, back to Alabama, Tennessee, even Canada. Archie will hang back with Peyton, Eli, and Cooper—\u0022Cupper\u0022 when Archie says it—his eldest. They\u0027ll laugh about something, and they\u0027ll head out, too. On this day, Archie will go to a training room, where a medical team will work on his ankles, trying to get the swelling down. And while they attempt to undo what hits, surgeries, and years have done, all around, boys, young and old, are playing football—hundreds of high schoolers who probably dream of playing in college; more than 35 college players who probably dream of playing in the NFL; Peyton and Eli, who probably dream of being Dad. And you can\u0027t help but wonder: What would Dad say to them?\u000A\u000A\u0022Don\u0027t take it for granted,\u0022 he says.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe Manning Passing Academy is a quarterback utopia disguised as a sleepaway camp, a four-day TED talk for tiny QBs. There are about 1,200 first-come, first-serve spots open to any kid between grades eight and twelve who logs online quickly enough to grab it. No stars and no accolades required. Parents say hotels in town are already booked for 2016, for spots that haven\u0027t even opened yet. Every kid gets a Spalding football. Archie likes that. There are no pads and no blitzes; no missed blocks or blindside hits. Just hours of drills—practicing a three- and five-step drop, both in the shotgun and under center; working on play action and deep ball throws, option pitches and zone reads. Most notably, like any dream world, it\u0027s free of uncertainty and speculation, those twin pillars plaguing football; questions about deflated footballs; about substance abuse and domestic violence; about head trauma; about Eli Manning, whether his 2-2 Giants can keep from a third consecutive losing season; about Peyton, whether his team is 4-0 because or in spite of an arm that doesn\u0027t throw like it once did; about where he ranks in history and how much time he has left before he leaves it all behind, too. \u0022Peyton will have a hard time,\u0022 his dad says. And out there, outside the Manning Passing Academy and inside all that noise, it can be hard not to take football for granted; to remember that, like anything, it doesn\u0027t last forever; to do the one thing Archie Manning most wants, from his sons and from his campers: Be enthusiastic and have fun.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s the same thing he wanted in 1996, when, at 47, sons grown, he held the first camp at Tulane. A noted counselor that year was a 20-year-old rising junior at the University of Tennessee named Peyton Manning. Eli was 15 years old. Cooper had just graduated from Ole Miss. The distance between that camp and this one can be measured in ways big and small. In campers who went on to play in the NFL; in spirals thrown; in autographs signed. For Archie and his boys, it can be measured in kids and grandkids, in college victories come and gone, in Super Bowls won and MVP trophies hoisted; in surgeries and scars; in all the things that life took back, a hurricane that came and took back the land where they learned to play football ten years ago, in their own backyard in New Orleans and at their own camp not far away; in the damaged tissue of a brain disease taking football away, and in Cooper\u0027s business success that he, an all-state wide receiver, found after a diagnosis of spinal stenosis took it away from him.\u000A\u000AAnd after all that, after those twenty years had come and gone, changing each of the Mannings\u0027 lives in different ways, you\u0027d look up and you\u0027d find yourself on a hot, sunny day in a place called Thibodaux, out past sixty miles of tangled branches and crumbling shacks between New Orleans and nowhere. You\u0027d be sitting in a golf cart with Archie Manning on the last day of a camp he started twenty years ago, wondering what you could learn in two hours about what hallowed secret is buried here that gets lost out there; what you could learn about why, after all this time, they all keep coming back.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022Obviously, I can forget what it\u0027s like to be 14 years old,\u0022 Archie says, outside the training room now, driving the golf cart he uses to get around. It\u0027s close to 10:00 A.M. and he circles the twenty-six fields that make up his camp, looking out at the young boys sweating their way through their last morning of quarterback drills on blue-sky day so heavy with humidity it\u0027ll leave a fog on your sunglasses. By the end of today, camp staff say they will have gone through 600 cases of Gatorade.   \u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s hot,\u0022 he says over the gentle put-put-put of the golf cart. \u0022They practice three times a day, so we send them to their dorms after lunch to get a little rest. And they\u0027re outside their dorm throwing a football.\u0022\u000A\u000AHere, he laughs.\u000A\u000A\u0022I mean, that\u0027s lovin\u0027 it. But that\u0027s what it\u0027s about.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s also about learning at the hands of high school coaches and college quarterbacks who, like the campers, are of varying levels of talent, from Heisman candidates (Cody Kessler of USC, Trevone Boykin of TCU) to guys you haven\u0027t heard of—and never will. They\u0027re just kids in their late teens or early twenties. But to the campers who see them on SportsCenter, they\u0027re superstars.\u000A\u000A\u0022This fall, this eighth- or ninth-grader from Maine,\u0022 says Archie from under his golf cart\u0027s roof, which provides shade—but little relief—from a blazing Southern sun as he drives past fields of campers. \u0022He\u0027s watching football and says, ‘Dak Prescott! He was my counselor! He was my counselor!\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AAnd there\u0027s something about that sort of unbridled enthusiasm that\u0027s infectious here. You might show up to find that you\u0027re living in a dorm with Peyton Manning\u0027s fullback from Tennessee, and Eli\u0027s backup quarterback with the Giants—and that you\u0027re all sharing a kitchen pre-stocked with a box of Cheerios, some Gatorade, and a case of Miller Lite. You might see hard-nosed NFL coach Sean Payton carrying a soft pillow to his uncomfortable dorm-room bed. It\u0027s a sleep-away camp for adults, too, charged with the hope accompanying those long-ago pink summer nights where the heat is stifling and the clouds look like cotton candy and you\u0027re not sure it\u0027ll ever end. You feel it driving the sixty miles out of New Orleans to Thibodaux, a place where you can still smoke cigarettes inside, so far out past pro-life signs and fireworks stores that this year, Peyton and Eli ran out of gas on their way in—like maybe you\u0027re driving somewhere outside of time. And you see it in 49-year-old Mike Gardner watching his son Quaid and holding a box of Peyton O\u0027s cereal from October 7, 2000, from when he lived in Indianapolis, that maybe, just maybe, Peyton will sign. You see all that and you think maybe Archie was wrong.\u000A\u000AMaybe, in a place like this, it\u0027s not so hard for anyone to remember what it\u0027s like to be 14 again.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u0022Hey! Archie!\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not the formal \u0022Mr. Archie\u0022 you\u0027re likely to hear around these parts. But then again, neither is the man who yelled it. Chubby and shirtless, he leans out of his pick-up truck as Archie drives past in his golf cart.\u000A\u000A\u0022How you doing, pal?\u0022 Archie asks cordially.\u000A\u000A\u0022Can I git a pitcher wit ya?\u0022\u000A\u000AArchie is always happy to take one. The man walks over and hands me his phone.\u000A\u000A\u0022Take a pitcher wit my phone. I\u0027m gonna put my shirt on.\u0022\u000A\u000AA shirtless man in Louisiana got out of his truck and put on a shirt to take a picture with Archie Manning. If that doesn\u0027t give you a sense of the respect he commands in these parts, you may never get it. He\u0027s the Godfather who would never ask you to kiss the ring—he\u0027s too gracious and modest—but everyone insists on kissing anyway. And outside of being a really good QB camp where you can learn from some of the best to ever play it, that\u0027s why people come here to this small town of Louisiana, flooding $2,000,000 into the local economy, per camp sources, from all over the country: to be near the First Family of Football.\u000A\u000A\u0022Peyton\u0027s never said, ‘You know what, Dad, I gotta do a commitment that Friday afternoon.\u0027 A lot of camps, they would be here Thursday, check in, take pictures with everybody, be around the field one day, you never see \u0027em again,\u0022 Archie says, looking out onto the fields where his sons are floating around somewhere, helping the college guys lead high schoolers through drills. \u0022The campers see them every day.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AEli and Peyton teach drills and throw kids passes, while campers\u0027 parents (if they\u0027re here) watch rapt with attention—either via their eyes or through their iPhone lens. Peyton\u0027s intense, the same way he is on Sunday. Eli\u0027s more quiet and reserved. \u0022He just kinda rolls with it,\u0022 as Archie says. And Cooper, an all-state wide receiver until he was forced to quit because of spinal stenosis, may be the least famous, but he\u0027s the camp favorite, the resident emcee and funnyman, ribbing the campers and making everyone laugh.\u000A\u000A\u0022They\u0027re definitely three different animals,\u0022 says Archie. \u0022And they all got a little more than what you see. Cooper does have a serious side. Peyton does relax and have fun. And Eli does open up.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe Mannings hang together in a room called \u0022Archie\u0027s Bunker,\u0022 ironically housed in the Brady Residential Complex—the last name of Golden Boy Tom Brady, Peyton\u0027s NFL rival and maybe the only person who can keep him from holding the title of Greatest Quarterback of All Time. Old friends of Archie\u0027s and the boys will cycle in and out at will, especially at night, before the counselors head out for big dinners scattered throughout Thibodaux. You can hear them from down the hallway. Peer in and you\u0027d see all of them laughing, drinking beer out of Solo cups before heading to a staff Seafood Night or Beast Feast, where they\u0027ll sit under a 300-year-old magnolia tree to tell stories way past campers\u0027 lights-out.\u000A\u000ABut Archie\u0027s not thinking about those rambunctious nights now, seated at the edge of Nicholls State\u0027s home turf. He looks out at a field of loud boys playing football on Manning Field and thinks of the quieter times. \u000A\u000A\u0022The most fun is, like, in between practices,\u0022 he says, in his way of speaking that crawls along. \u0022When we go back over to the—when we just, the four of us, just sitting around, watching TV, they\u0027re doing their thing with the movies. Just kinda being together.\u0022\u000A\u000ABoiling in the Southern sun, Archie watches his twentieth passing academy wind down, the end of a camp that started four days ago and something else that started long before that. Cooper, Peyton, and Eli are nowhere in sight.  \u000A\u000A\u0022Kinda like it used to be when they were 12 and 10 and 7,\u0022 Archie continues. \u0022Now they\u0027re 41, 39, and 34. I mean, that\u0027s—\u0022\u000A\u000AHere he stops and pauses, another moment gone.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yeah,\u0022 he says, trailing off.\u000A\u000AAnother way to measure the distance since the first camp? Holidays missed. Christmases and Thanksgivings not spent together because of football games. But you could also measure it in camps, father and sons finally back together. And isn\u0027t that sort of like Christmas? As so many other things changed, this one world remained.\u000A\u000ADifferent campers, and different coaches, and different locations.\u000A\u000ABut one camp, every year, for twenty years.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ADoes Archie Manning miss the football?\u000A\u000A\u0022Nawwww,\u0022 he draws it out, then says it twice more, just to be sure. \u0022Naw. Naw. I don\u0027t miss it. When I quit football, I left it. I never missed it.\u000A\u000A\u0022When it\u0027s over, it\u0027s over.\u0022\u000A\u000AHigh schoolers are streaming in from fields across the campus, gathering to hear some final words from Archie. They\u0027re sweaty, and some shirtless, with red necks and bad farmer\u0027s tans. The auditory pulse of summer football hums: infectious laughter, shrill whistles, and the pop of kids banging mud out of their cleats, echoing in and out of the stadium and the shadows of twenty years gone.\u000A\u000A\u0022I\u0027m 66,\u0022 Archie says, laughing, parked at the edge of the field, thinking about how much longer he can do this. \u0022Peyton\u0027s in his eighteenth year. I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll change when he retires. I think he\u0027ll be just as passionate. He\u0027ll probably quit throwing.\u000A\u000A\u0022But you know, heck—\u0022 he pauses, maybe a little hopeful. \u0022Won\u0027t be too long I\u0027ll have some grandsons. They come now, but you know, when they\u0027re in eighth grade, old enough to come [as a camper].\u0022\u000A\u000AHe gets up front the golf cart and is handed a microphone, into which he says, \u0022It\u0027s Archie,\u0022 which is funny because it\u0027s his camp and his field and he\u0027s Archie fucking Manning. As Archie tells the kids how much he enjoyed them and how he hopes they come back, Peyton and Eli are on the road, having left hours ago (hopefully with a full tank of gas) in identical outfits—golf shirts tucked into khaki shorts—back into all that noise, into an NFL season that may be Peyton\u0027s last. This afternoon, Cooper will leave, too, taking his own sons to Dixie Basketball Camp, a camp started by LSU great Joe Dean in 1966. Dean died in 2013, and his son Joe, Jr., now runs what he started fifty years ago.\u000A\u000A\u0022Fiftieth year,\u0022 Archie says.\u000A\u000AWill the Manning Passing Academy make it there?\u000A\u000A\u0022Golllll-ly,\u0022 Archie says, driving away in his golf cart, back to his empty dorm room, campers and counselors off in the distance behind him, thinking about time and what it does. \u0022Not with me.\u0022   \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest",

data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.0">It&#x2019;s early on the last day of the Manning Passing Academy, and hidden in a room under the bleachers of a small Louisiana stadium, former New Orleans Saints quarterback Archie Manning is telling a story. Current Saints head coach Sean Payton has just handed him an <a href="https://instagram.com/p/5DA9OkJxIb/?taken-by=parkerwaters">oversize ring</a> marking his inclusion, years back, among the inaugural names lining the Superdome&#x2019;s Ring of Honor, spots reserved for the team&#x2019;s eternal greats.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.1">&#x201C;I speak every now and then. People rent out the Superdome,&#x201D; he says, in his slow, sprawling drawl. He&#x2019;s wearing a green, long-sleeve camp T-shirt, emblazoned with &#x201C;20th Year&#x201D; under the letters MPA and tucked into khaki shorts. He&#x2019;s trim. His skin is red and his hair white. If you could see his legs behind the lectern, you&#x2019;d see swollen ankles. If you could see him walk, you&#x2019;d see a limp. He&#x2019;s 66.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.2">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m giving a speech. People are seated. I&#x2019;m doing a Q&amp;A,&#x201D; he continues. &#x201C;And a lady says, &#x2018;Why is your name up there?&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.3">Archie smiles, deep in the stadium housing Manning Field, deep in the camp named after him, too, thinking about all those hits his body took long ago.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.5">&#x201C;I said, &#x2018;Every Sunday afternoon, I was on my butt, looking.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.6">The room shakes with laughter, coming from the 120 or so counselors&#x2014;high school and small-college coaches; college quarterbacks like Mississippi State&#x2019;s Dak Prescott and Penn State&#x2019;s Christian Hackenberg; sons Peyton and Eli&#x2014;and bouncing off walls lined with pictures from two decades of camps. There&#x2019;s a younger Colin Kaepernick. Andrew Luck and Russell Wilson, too. Former campers and counselors who&#x2019;ve done good&#x2014;maybe too good, since one forced Archie&#x2019;s middle boy out of his <a href="https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/news/4172/revisiting-the-andrew-luck-over-peyton-manning-decision-after-3-years">old job</a> and the other beat him in his first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-byJvHAXQA">Super Bowl</a> at his new one.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.7">He doesn&#x2019;t say much else.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.8">&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t believe in a lot of speeches,&#x201D; he tells me.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.9">Then the double doors of the staff&#x2019;s makeshift home base will open and the counselors will spread out across the fields of Nicholls State&#x2019;s campus. They&#x2019;ll meet roughly 1,200 campers for their last half-day of camp, before they get in their cars with Mom and Dad and go home, back to Alabama, Tennessee, even Canada. Archie will hang back with Peyton, Eli, and Cooper&#x2014;&#x201C;Cupper&#x201D; when Archie says it&#x2014;his eldest. They&#x2019;ll laugh about something, and they&#x2019;ll head out, too. On this day, Archie will go to a training room, where a medical team will work on his ankles, trying to get the swelling down. And while they attempt to undo what hits, surgeries, and years have done, all around, boys, young and old, are playing football&#x2014;hundreds of high schoolers who probably dream of playing in college; more than 35 college players who probably dream of playing in the NFL; Peyton and Eli, who probably dream of being Dad. And you can&#x2019;t help but wonder: What would Dad say to them?</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.a">&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t take it for granted,&#x201D; he says.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.b"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/561841d5e8a83977119f77d3/master/w_806/manning-qb-camp-05.jpg" alt="manning-qb-camp-05.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;t=manning-qb-camp-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;t=manning-qb-camp-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F561841d5e8a83977119f77d3%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmanning-qb-camp-05.jpg&amp;description=manning-qb-camp-05.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F561841d5e8a83977119f77d3%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmanning-qb-camp-05.jpg&amp;description=manning-qb-camp-05.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.c"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.d">The Manning Passing Academy is a quarterback utopia disguised as a sleepaway camp, a four-day TED talk for tiny QBs. There are about 1,200 first-come, first-serve spots open to any kid between grades eight and twelve who logs online quickly enough to grab it. No stars and no accolades required. Parents say hotels in town are already booked for 2016, for spots that haven&#x2019;t even opened yet. Every kid gets a Spalding football. Archie likes that. There are no pads and no blitzes; no missed blocks or blindside hits. Just hours of drills&#x2014;practicing a three- and five-step drop, both in the shotgun and under center; working on play action and deep ball throws, option pitches and zone reads. Most notably, like any dream world, it&#x2019;s free of uncertainty and speculation, those twin pillars plaguing football; questions about deflated footballs; about substance abuse and domestic violence; about head trauma; about Eli Manning, whether his 2-2 Giants can keep from a third consecutive losing season; about Peyton, whether his team is 4-0 because or in spite of an arm that doesn&#x2019;t throw like it once did; about where he ranks in history and how much time he has left before he leaves it all behind, too. &#x201C;Peyton will have a hard time,&#x201D; his dad says. And out there, outside the Manning Passing Academy and inside all that noise, it can be hard not to take football for granted; to remember that, like anything, it doesn&#x2019;t last forever; to do the one thing Archie Manning most wants, from his sons and from his campers: Be enthusiastic and have fun.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.e">It&#x2019;s the same thing he wanted in 1996, when, at 47, sons grown, he held the first camp at Tulane. A noted counselor that year was a 20-year-old rising junior at the University of Tennessee named Peyton Manning. Eli was 15 years old. Cooper had just graduated from Ole Miss. The distance between that camp and this one can be measured in ways big and small. In campers who went on to play in the NFL; in spirals thrown; in autographs signed. For Archie and his boys, it can be measured in kids and grandkids, in college victories come and gone, in Super Bowls won and MVP trophies hoisted; in surgeries and scars; in all the things that life took back, a hurricane that came and took back the land where they learned to play football ten years ago, in their own backyard in New Orleans and at their own camp not far away; in the damaged tissue of a brain disease taking football away, and in Cooper&#x2019;s business success that he, an all-state wide receiver, found after a diagnosis of spinal stenosis took it away from him.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.f">And after all that, after those twenty years had come and gone, changing each of the Mannings&#x2019; lives in different ways, you&#x2019;d look up and you&#x2019;d find yourself on a hot, sunny day in a place called Thibodaux, out past sixty miles of tangled branches and crumbling shacks between New Orleans and nowhere. You&#x2019;d be sitting in a golf cart with Archie Manning on the last day of a camp he started twenty years ago, wondering what you could learn in two hours about what hallowed secret is buried here that gets lost out there; what you could learn about why, after all this time, they all keep coming back.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.g"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/561841d5ca8ab11b31fad09e/master/w_806/manning-qb-camp-04.jpg" alt="manning-qb-camp-04.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;t=manning-qb-camp-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;t=manning-qb-camp-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F561841d5ca8ab11b31fad09e%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmanning-qb-camp-04.jpg&amp;description=manning-qb-camp-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F561841d5ca8ab11b31fad09e%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmanning-qb-camp-04.jpg&amp;description=manning-qb-camp-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.h"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.i">&#x201C;Obviously, I can forget what it&#x2019;s like to be 14 years old,&#x201D; Archie says, outside the training room now, driving the golf cart he uses to get around. It&#x2019;s close to 10:00 A.M. and he circles the twenty-six fields that make up his camp, looking out at the young boys sweating their way through their last morning of quarterback drills on blue-sky day so heavy with humidity it&#x2019;ll leave a fog on your sunglasses. By the end of today, camp staff say they will have gone through 600 cases of Gatorade.   </p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.j">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s hot,&#x201D; he says over the gentle <em>put-put-put</em> of the golf cart. &#x201C;They practice three times a day, so we send them to their dorms after lunch to get a little rest. And they&#x2019;re outside their dorm throwing a football.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.k">Here, he laughs.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.l">&#x201C;I mean, that&#x2019;s lovin&apos; it. But that&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s about.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.m">It&#x2019;s also about learning at the hands of high school coaches and college quarterbacks who, like the campers, are of varying levels of talent, from Heisman candidates (Cody Kessler of USC, Trevone Boykin of TCU) to guys you haven&#x2019;t heard of&#x2014;and never will. They&#x2019;re just kids in their late teens or early twenties. But to the campers who see them on SportsCenter, they&#x2019;re superstars.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.n">&#x201C;This fall, this eighth- or ninth-grader from Maine,&#x201D; says Archie from under his golf cart&#x2019;s roof, which provides shade&#x2014;but little relief&#x2014;from a blazing Southern sun as he drives past fields of campers. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s watching football and says, &#x2018;Dak Prescott! He was my counselor! He was my counselor!&#x2019; &#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.o">And there&#x2019;s something about that sort of unbridled enthusiasm that&#x2019;s infectious here. You might show up to find that you&#x2019;re living in a dorm with Peyton Manning&#x2019;s fullback from Tennessee, and Eli&#x2019;s backup quarterback with the Giants&#x2014;and that you&#x2019;re all sharing a kitchen pre-stocked with a box of Cheerios, some Gatorade, and a case of Miller Lite. You might see hard-nosed NFL coach Sean Payton carrying a soft pillow to his uncomfortable dorm-room bed. It&#x2019;s a sleep-away camp for adults, too, charged with the hope accompanying those long-ago pink summer nights where the heat is stifling and the clouds look like cotton candy and you&#x2019;re not sure it&#x2019;ll ever end. You feel it driving the sixty miles out of New Orleans to Thibodaux, a place where you can still smoke cigarettes inside, so far out past pro-life signs and fireworks stores that this year, Peyton and Eli ran out of gas on their way in&#x2014;like maybe you&#x2019;re driving somewhere outside of time. And you see it in 49-year-old Mike Gardner watching his son Quaid and holding a box of <em><a href="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/b9cAAOSw7NNUB2V0/$_1.JPG">Peyton O&#x2019;s</a></em> cereal from October 7, 2000, from when he lived in Indianapolis, that maybe, just maybe, Peyton will sign. You see all that and you think maybe Archie was wrong.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.p">Maybe, in a place like this, it&#x2019;s not so hard for anyone to remember what it&#x2019;s like to be 14 again.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.q"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/561841cd6349dcfa15f262f8/master/w_806/manning-qb-camp-02.jpg" alt="manning-qb-camp-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;t=manning-qb-camp-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;t=manning-qb-camp-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F561841cd6349dcfa15f262f8%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmanning-qb-camp-02.jpg&amp;description=manning-qb-camp-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F561841cd6349dcfa15f262f8%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmanning-qb-camp-02.jpg&amp;description=manning-qb-camp-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.r"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.s">&#x201C;Hey!

But then again, neither is the man who yelled it. Chubby and shirtless, he leans out of his pick-up truck as Archie drives past in his golf cart.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.u">&#x201C;How you doing, pal?&#x201D; Archie asks cordially.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.v">&#x201C;Can I git a pitcher wit ya?&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.w">Archie is always happy to take one.

I&#x2019;m gonna put my shirt on.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.y">A shirtless man in Louisiana got out of his truck and put on a shirt to take a picture with Archie Manning. If that doesn&#x2019;t give you a sense of the respect he commands in these parts, you may never get it. He&#x2019;s the Godfather who would never ask you to kiss the ring&#x2014;he&#x2019;s too gracious and modest&#x2014;but everyone insists on kissing anyway. And outside of being a really good QB camp where you can learn from some of the best to ever play it, that&#x2019;s why people come here to this small town of Louisiana, flooding $2,000,000 into the local economy, per camp sources, from all over the country: to be near the First Family of Football.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.z">&#x201C;Peyton&#x2019;s never said, &#x2018;You know what, Dad, I gotta do a commitment that Friday afternoon.&#x2019; A lot of camps, they would be here Thursday, check in, take pictures with everybody, be around the field one day, you never see &#x2019;em again,&#x201D; Archie says, looking out onto the fields where his sons are floating around somewhere, helping the college guys lead high schoolers through drills. &#x201C;The campers see them every day.&#x201D;</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.10"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/561841cbca8ab11b31fad095/master/w_806/manning-qb-camp-01.jpg" alt="manning-qb-camp-01.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;t=manning-qb-camp-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;t=manning-qb-camp-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F561841cbca8ab11b31fad095%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmanning-qb-camp-01.jpg&amp;description=manning-qb-camp-01.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farchie-manning-nfl-quarterback-camp&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F561841cbca8ab11b31fad095%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fmanning-qb-camp-01.jpg&amp;description=manning-qb-camp-01.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.11">Eli and Peyton teach drills and throw kids passes, while campers&#x2019; parents (if they&#x2019;re here) watch rapt with attention&#x2014;either via their eyes or through their iPhone lens. Peyton&#x2019;s intense, the same way he is on Sunday. Eli&#x2019;s more quiet and reserved. &#x201C;He just kinda rolls with it,&#x201D; as Archie says. And Cooper, an all-state wide receiver until he was forced to quit because of spinal stenosis, may be the least famous, but he&#x2019;s the camp favorite, the resident emcee and funnyman, ribbing the campers and making everyone laugh.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.12">&#x201C;They&#x2019;re definitely three different animals,&#x201D; says Archie. &#x201C;And they all got a little more than what you see. Cooper does have a serious side. Peyton does relax and have fun. And Eli does open up.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.13">The Mannings hang together in a room called &#x201C;Archie&#x2019;s Bunker,&#x201D; ironically housed in the Brady Residential Complex&#x2014;the last name of Golden Boy Tom Brady, Peyton&#x2019;s NFL rival and maybe the only person who can keep him from holding the title of Greatest Quarterback of All Time. Old friends of Archie&#x2019;s and the boys will cycle in and out at will, especially at night, before the counselors head out for big dinners scattered throughout Thibodaux. You can hear them from down the hallway. Peer in and you&#x2019;d see all of them laughing, drinking beer out of Solo cups before heading to a staff Seafood Night or Beast Feast, where they&#x2019;ll sit under a 300-year-old magnolia tree to tell stories way past campers&#x2019; lights-out.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.14">But Archie&#x2019;s not thinking about those rambunctious nights now, seated at the edge of Nicholls State&#x2019;s home turf. He looks out at a field of loud boys playing football on Manning Field and thinks of the quieter times. </p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.15">&#x201C;The most fun is, like, in between practices,&#x201D; he says, in his way of speaking that crawls along. &#x201C;When we go back over to the&#x2014;when we just, the four of us, just sitting around, watching TV, they&#x2019;re doing their thing with the movies. Just kinda being together.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.16">Boiling in the Southern sun, Archie watches his twentieth passing academy wind down, the end of a camp that started four days ago and something else that started long before that. Cooper, Peyton, and Eli are nowhere in sight.  </p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.17">&#x201C;Kinda like it used to be when they were 12 and 10 and 7,&#x201D; Archie continues. &#x201C;Now they&#x2019;re 41, 39, and 34. I mean, that&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.18">Here he stops and pauses, another moment gone.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.19">&#x201C;Yeah,&#x201D; he says, trailing off.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.1a">Another way to measure the distance since the first camp? Holidays missed. Christmases and Thanksgivings not spent together because of football games. But you could also measure it in camps, father and sons finally back together. And isn&apos;t that sort of like Christmas? As so many other things changed, this one world remained.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.1b">Different campers, and different coaches, and different locations.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.1c">But one camp, every year, for twenty years.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.1d"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.1e">Does Archie Manning miss the football?</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.1f">&#x201C;Nawwww,&#x201D; he draws it out, then says it twice more, just to be sure. &#x201C;Naw.

They&#x2019;re sweaty, and some shirtless, with red necks and bad farmer&#x2019;s tans. The auditory pulse of summer football hums: infectious laughter, shrill whistles, and the pop of kids banging mud out of their cleats, echoing in and out of the stadium and the shadows of twenty years gone.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.1i">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m 66,&#x201D; Archie says, laughing, parked at the edge of the field, thinking about how much longer he can do this. &#x201C;Peyton&#x2019;s in his eighteenth year. I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;ll change when he retires. I think he&#x2019;ll be just as passionate. He&#x2019;ll probably quit throwing.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.1j">&#x201C;But you know, heck&#x2014;&#x201D; he pauses, maybe a little hopeful. &#x201C;Won&#x2019;t be too long I&#x2019;ll have some grandsons. They come now, but you know, when they&#x2019;re in eighth grade, old enough to come [as a camper].&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.1k">He gets up front the golf cart and is handed a microphone, into which he says, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s Archie,&#x201D; which is funny because it&#x2019;s his camp and his field and he&#x2019;s Archie <em>fucking</em> Manning. As Archie tells the kids how much he enjoyed them and how he hopes they come back, Peyton and Eli are on the road, having left hours ago (hopefully with a full tank of gas) in identical outfits&#x2014;golf shirts tucked into khaki shorts&#x2014;back into all that noise, into an NFL season that may be Peyton&#x2019;s last. This afternoon, Cooper will leave, too, taking his own sons to Dixie Basketball Camp, a camp started by LSU great Joe Dean in 1966. Dean died in 2013, and his son Joe, Jr., now runs what he started fifty years ago.</p><p data-reactid=".28bmb16ofsw.1.1.0.0.4.1l">&#x201C;<em>Fiftieth</em> year,&#x201D; Archie says.</p><p
