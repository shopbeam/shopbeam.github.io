  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A1. Watch Stephen Dorff kick ass (literally and figuratively) in Zaytoun. The unexpectedly sweet buddy-road trip movie hits theaters in New York Friday—national release to follow!—which gives you about four days to figure out how you\u0027re going to explain that a Stephen Dorff movie made you choke up. Here\u0027s more from our conversation with Dorff from GQ\u0027s October issue.\u000A\u000AGQ: In Zaytoun, you play a captured Israeli fighter pilot who unexpectedly befriends a Palestinian teen (played by Abdallah El Akal)—the same boy who shoots down his plane—in 1982 war-torn Lebanon. Before you become friends though, you\u0027re enemies—did you feel guilty about roughing him up during filming?\u000A\u000A Stephen Dorff: I purposefully put him through the wringer a little bit, in the beginning. I wanted us to not be the best of friends, and he was confused. One night, I got real intense towards him and I just didn\u0027t talk to him. I played with him a bit, but it worked to my advantage. I kind of did it subconsciously. And I didn\u0027t like doing it, because I really liked him as a kid. If I didn\u0027t have Abdallah, this movie wouldn\u0027t have worked; Abdallah\u0027s the real deal. It was the night before the scene where I rough him up—I was rough with him, a little bit, to the point where he was like, \u0022What are you doing, Steph? What are you doing?\u0022 And I\u0027m like, \u0022Abdallah, I\u0027m going to fucking go there. I\u0027m going to pull your fucking hair because I\u0027m not supposed to be nice here. Feel it. Act it.\u0022 And I made sure he was okay. I\u0027m not going to, like, hurt the kid, but I wasn\u0027t faking it, you know?\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A2. See Andy Samberg\u0027s return to your TV screen. In Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which premieres tomorrow night on FOX. He plays a detective (Jake Peralta) in a Brooklyn precinct, which sounds like a very serious job. But he also wears a Speedo in the office and holds fire extinguisher roller chair derbies, so you know he\u0027s, like, funny. And so is the show. It\u0027s Parks and Recreation—which the show\u0027s co-creator Mike Schur also helped, uh, co-create—meets Law and Order...if Law and Order were funnier, less bloody, and included Fred Armisen-as-creepy-neighbor cameos. The setting lends itself to be the backdrop for cases that land somewhere between serious and absurd. Because only in Brooklyn would it be plausible that someone gets murdered for his very expensive Jam&amp;#xF3;n Ibérico.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A \u000A\u000A3. Figure out what makes a good guy go bad in A Single Shot. The film—which is based on the Matthew F. Jones novel by the same title and opens in theaters Friday—follows the story of John Moon (played by Sam Rockwell), a down-on-his-luck farmer who lost it all: his family, his job, and, eventually, his mind. While trailing a deer in the woods, Moon accidentally shoots a woman; he rushes to her in hopes she\u0027s alive (spoiler: she isn\u0027t!), and discovers a box of money. Panicked, he hides her body and runs off with the cash, which he hopes to use to fix the wrong in his life. Obviously, it doesn\u0027t. Throughout the film—which also stars William H. Macy and Jeffrey Wright—it\u0027s tough to figure out if Moon is a good guy, or a bad one...we asked Rockwell and the film\u0027s director David M. Rosenthal to help us out.\u000A\u000ASam Rockwell: He\u0027s just a guy, and he\u0027s done a bad thing accidentally and he does a stupid thing by trying to get away with it. Stupid or not, I think he\u0027s in denial. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s really emotionally in touch with what\u0027s just happened. (Until maybe when the bad guys put the body in his bedroom and wraps it in plastic with a note; I think that he has a bit of a meltdown from there.) He\u0027s running from the problem and he\u0027s in this fantasy world that this money\u0027s going to turn everything around for him. He\u0027s in this crazy, like, denial. He\u0027s not really dealing with the problem.\u000A\u000ADavid M. Rosenthal: If you met him and you shook his hand, you\u0027d think: This is a good guy. In the beginning, we think this is an accident—we don\u0027t know, he\u0027s dragging this body away, What\u0027s he doing? Oh my god, what\u0027s he going to do? And he finds this money, so we think his sin is greed. But later, it occurs to us: Pride is his real sin and greed is almost a secondary sin for him. Because as much as he wants the money, he doesn\u0027t really care about the money—he wants his wife back, he wants his life back, he wants his position in the community back. And he doesn\u0027t want to have to do these shitty little jobs and he doesn\u0027t like who he is at this moment. So in some ways, it feels like a morality play on some level about pride. Is he a good guy? Yes. Is he flawed? Absolutely. Are we all flawed? Of course we are. We can recognize ourselves in him. I think that\u0027s why it was so important casting someone like Sam because Sam is so intrinsically likable that even if you\u0027re watching Sam, as John Moon, make a terrible decision, you still root for him.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A4. Play this new Grouplove song at your next dance party. Grouplove—that L.A.-based indie rock group whose breakthrough single, \u0022Tongue Tied,\u0022 is still stuck in your head—drops its new album, Spreading Rumours, tomorrow. The songs: joyful, fun, and nothing like one another. In other words, party-perfect. As drummer Ryan Rabin tells us, \u0022The tangent that we went on from song to song ended up taking themselves to even bigger extremes than the last album, so everything is even more diverse from one another on this one.\u0022 Like, the new single \u0022Ways to Go.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A5. Go see a movie about abortion (really!). After Tiller, named for George Tiller, the Kansas doctor who was murdered in his church in 2009, follows four of the remaining doctors in the U.S. who still (openly) provide late-term abortions, and captures the rarely witnessed, bracingly candid conversations between doctor and patient. The film, which opens in theaters Friday, might not change anyone\u0027s beliefs on the matter, but it will remind you that there are women—actual women!—who make and live with these decisions. —Sarah Goldstein\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A6. Count the early-aughts jokes in Thomas Pynchon\u0027s latest doorstop. \u0022Paranoia\u0027s the garlic in life\u0027s kitchen,\u0022 Thomas Pynchon writes in his new novel, Bleeding Edge. \u0022You can never have too much.\u0022 It sure sounds like the same ol\u0027 Pynchon, but this time he\u0027s finally writing about the (near) present tense—specifically, the absurd moment of pre-9/11 2001. The backdrop (a fraud investigation into proto-Zuckerberg scheming) is new, but the sleuthing, the secrets, and especially the nod to cultural paraphernalia are all back. Here\u0027s an incomplete list of his targets —Daniel Riley\u000A\u000A Pokemon (e.g., Psyduck; e.g., Gangar)\u000A \u0022now this ox thing\u0022\u000A Carmen Electra\u000A Bernie Madoff: fledgling fraudster\u000A A guy who hacks Furbys\u000A \u0022weblogs\u0022\u000A Zima on tap\u000A the Krispy Kreme craze\u000A Festering indignation toward \u0022the yups\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A7. Relive those \u0022too big to fail\u0022 days of 2008—oh, and finally understand WTF happened—with Hank Paulson. It\u0027s been about five years since Lehman Brothers collapsed, banks were bailed out, and sadguysontradingfloors.tumblr.com was a thing—now the U.S. Treasury Secretary at the time Henry \u0022Hank\u0022 Paulson sits down to explain it all. The documentary, HANK: Five Years from the Brink, which will begin streaming exclusively on Netflix Tuesday, tells the story of what the hell happened: how the global financial crisis began, what was said in those closed-door meetings with CEOs from world banks, and why the bailouts became the economy\u0027s Band-Aid. It\u0027s a compelling, first-hand look into the scariest time in recent economic history. The bad news: another crisis may be inevitable. As Paulson says in the clip below, \u0022I have increasingly come to the view that it\u0027s important that there be a historical record for those that come after me...so we don\u0027t replay this movie all over again.\u0022 So, uh, watch and take notes.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest",

unexpectedly sweet buddy-road trip movie hits theaters in New York Friday&#x2014;national release to follow!&#x2014;which gives you about four days to figure out how you&#x2019;re going to explain that a Stephen Dorff movie made you choke up. Here&#x2019;s more from our conversation with Dorff from <em>GQ</em>&#x2019;s October issue.</p><p data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>GQ: In <em>Zaytoun</em>, you play a captured Israeli fighter pilot who unexpectedly befriends a Palestinian teen (played by Abdallah El Akal)&#x2014;the same boy who shoots down his plane&#x2014;in 1982 war-torn Lebanon. Before you become friends though, you&#x2019;re enemies&#x2014;did you feel guilty about roughing him up during filming?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.3"> <strong>Stephen Dorff:</strong> I purposefully put him through the wringer a little bit, in the beginning. I wanted us to not be the best of friends, and he was confused. One night, I got real intense towards him and I just didn&#x2019;t talk to him. I played with him a bit, but it worked to my advantage. I kind of did it subconsciously. And I didn&#x2019;t like doing it, because I really liked him as a kid. If I didn&#x2019;t have Abdallah, this movie wouldn&#x2019;t have worked; Abdallah&#x2019;s the real deal. It was the night before the scene where I rough him up&#x2014;I was rough with him, a little bit, to the point where he was like, &quot;What are you doing, Steph? What are you doing?&quot; And I&#x2019;m like, &quot;Abdallah, I&#x2019;m going to fucking go there. I&#x2019;m going to pull your fucking hair because I&#x2019;m not supposed to be nice here. Feel it. Act it.&quot; And I made sure he was okay. I&#x2019;m not going to, like, hurt the kid, but I wasn&#x2019;t faking it, you know?&quot;</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.5"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/n7seQlcJlAg" height="315" width="560"></iframe></div></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.6"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.7"><a href="the-gq-punch-list-9-16-2013-mindy-project-andy-samberg-stephen-dorff"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>See Andy Samberg&#x2019;s return to your TV screen.</strong> In <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>, which premieres tomorrow night on FOX. He plays a detective (Jake Peralta) in a Brooklyn precinct, which sounds like a very serious job. But he also wears a Speedo in the office and holds fire extinguisher roller chair derbies, so you know he&#x2019;s, like, funny. And so is the show. It&#x2019;s <em>Parks and Recreation</em>&#x2014;which the show&#x2019;s co-creator Mike Schur also helped, uh, co-create&#x2014;meets <em>Law and Order</em>...if <em>Law and Order</em> were funnier, less bloody, and included Fred Armisen-as-creepy-neighbor cameos. The setting lends itself to be the backdrop for cases that land somewhere between serious and absurd. Because only in Brooklyn would it be plausible that someone gets murdered for his very expensive Jam&amp;#xF3;n Ib&#xE9;rico.</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.8"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/D1UzmW77F30" height="315" width="560"></iframe></div></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.9"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.a"> <a href="http://blog.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2013/09/13/a-single-shot.jpg"></a></p><p data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.b"><a href="the-gq-punch-list-9-16-2013-mindy-project-andy-samberg-stephen-dorff"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Figure out what makes a good guy go bad in <em>A Single Shot</em>.</strong> The film&#x2014;which is based on the Matthew F. Jones novel by the same title and opens in theaters Friday&#x2014;follows the story of John Moon (played by Sam Rockwell), a down-on-his-luck farmer who lost it all: his family, his job, and, eventually, his mind. While trailing a deer in the woods, Moon accidentally shoots a woman; he rushes to her in hopes she&#x2019;s alive (spoiler: she isn&#x2019;t!), and discovers a box of money. Panicked, he hides her body and runs off with the cash, which he hopes to use to fix the wrong in his life. Obviously, it doesn&#x2019;t. Throughout the film&#x2014;which also stars William H. Macy and Jeffrey Wright&#x2014;it&#x2019;s tough to figure out if Moon is a good guy, or a bad one...we asked Rockwell and the film&#x2019;s director David M. Rosenthal to help us out.</p><p data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Sam Rockwell:</strong> He&#x2019;s just a guy, and he&#x2019;s done a bad thing accidentally and he does a stupid thing by trying to get away with it. Stupid or not, I think he&#x2019;s in denial. I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s really emotionally in touch with what&#x2019;s just happened. (Until maybe when the bad guys put the body in his bedroom and wraps it in plastic with a note; I think that he has a bit of a meltdown from there.) He&#x2019;s running from the problem and he&#x2019;s in this fantasy world that this money&#x2019;s going to turn everything around for him. He&#x2019;s in this crazy, like, denial. He&#x2019;s not really dealing with the problem.</p><p data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>David M. Rosenthal:</strong> If you met him and you shook his hand, you&#x2019;d think: <em>This is a good guy</em>. In the beginning, we think this is an accident&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t know, he&#x2019;s dragging this body away, <em>What&#x2019;s he doing? Oh my god, what&#x2019;s he going to do?</em> And he finds this money, so we think his sin is greed. But later, it occurs to us: Pride is his real sin and greed is almost a secondary sin for him. Because as much as he wants the money, he doesn&#x2019;t really care about the money&#x2014;he wants his wife back, he wants his life back, he wants his position in the community back. And he doesn&#x2019;t want to have to do these shitty little jobs and he doesn&#x2019;t like who he is at this moment. So in some ways, it feels like a morality play on some level about pride. Is he a good guy? Yes. Is he flawed? Absolutely. Are we all flawed? Of course we are. We can recognize ourselves in him. I think that&#x2019;s why it was so important casting someone like Sam because Sam is so intrinsically likable that even if you&#x2019;re watching Sam, as John Moon, make a terrible decision, you still root for him.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.e"><hr></div><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.f"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/558288db1177d66d68d51d63/master/w_806/blogs-the-feed-2013-09-13-group-love.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-2013-09-13-group-love.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-gq-punch-list-9-16-2013-mindy-project-andy-samberg-stephen-dorff&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-2013-09-13-group-love.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-gq-punch-list-9-16-2013-mindy-project-andy-samberg-stephen-dorff&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-2013-09-13-group-love.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-gq-punch-list-9-16-2013-mindy-project-andy-samberg-stephen-dorff&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558288db1177d66d68d51d63%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-2013-09-13-group-love.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-2013-09-13-group-love.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fthe-gq-punch-list-9-16-2013-mindy-project-andy-samberg-stephen-dorff&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F558288db1177d66d68d51d63%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-2013-09-13-group-love.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-2013-09-13-group-love.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.g"><a href="the-gq-punch-list-9-16-2013-mindy-project-andy-samberg-stephen-dorff"></a><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Play this new Grouplove song at your next dance party.</strong> Grouplove&#x2014;that L.A.-based indie rock group whose breakthrough single, &quot;Tongue Tied,&quot; is still stuck in your head&#x2014;drops its new album, <em>Spreading Rumours</em>, tomorrow.

The documentary, <em>HANK: Five Years from the Brink</em>, which will begin streaming exclusively on Netflix Tuesday, tells the story of what the hell happened: how the global financial crisis began, what was said in those closed-door meetings with CEOs from world banks, and why the bailouts became the economy&#x2019;s Band-Aid. It&#x2019;s a compelling, first-hand look into the scariest time in recent economic history. The bad news: another crisis may be inevitable. As Paulson says in the clip below, &quot;I have increasingly come to the view that it&#x2019;s important that there be a historical record for those that come after me...so we don&#x2019;t replay this movie all over again.&quot; So, uh, watch and take notes.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".1w9ry21a4u8.1.1.0.0.4.s"><hr></div><div class="embed image"
