  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A Photo: Wesley Hitt/Getty Images\u000A\u000ABe kind, rewind, and sprinkle some faded confetti on your shoulders as you shlep back along with me to the fall of 2010. The Saints were fresh off winning the Super Bowl, and New Orleanians pretty much wanted carnival season to last all year just so that our funkiest city\u0027s paradoxically squeaky-clean quarterback—no demons or lubricity for diplomatic, wholesome Drew Brees--could be every Mardi Gras krewe\u0027s King of Kings full-time.\u000A\u000AOnce again, the nation\u0027s most insightful news source—The Onion—nailed it. \u0022Drew Brees Casually Wonders Aloud If He Really Could Get Away With Murder In This Town.\u0022\u000A\u000AAs it happens, I\u0027d just moved to New Orleans that year. The Saints even had something to do with that, since I\u0027d fallen in love with the place while watching them beat the Rdskns—supposedly, my hometown team, but a putz as utterly grotesque as Dan Snyder can take a lot out of a guy—during their \u002709 Super Bowl run. Because converts make the best zealots, I was as ready as anyone in the Crescent City to believe Brees jogged on water—or Katrina\u0027s floodwaters, anyway.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not news that the Saints\u0027 fortunes are entwined with the city\u0027s more intimately than is true of most NFL teams. That\u0027s why fanhood there is so lyrical; this was true even when they were midway between being punching bags and punchlines. Their victorious return to the refurbished Superdome in 2006 is enshrined in civic legend as the beginning of the city\u0027s post-hurricane resurrection. Owner Tom Benson\u0027s rumored scheme to relocate &amp;#x2018;em the hell to San Antonio in Katrina\u0027s aftermath got airbrushed right out of local history by Super Bowl euphoria.\u000A\u000ABrees, of course, knew all about being damaged goods, considering that his career prospects hadn\u0027t looked too good after the Chargers dumped him in \u002705. Besides the Miami Dolphins, who were kind of grudging about it, the hard-luck Saints were the only team that wanted him at all. That made him a natural as the figurative and then literal MVP of New Orleans\u0027s comeback saga.\u000A\u000APersonable the way Tom Brady isn\u0027t, because petulance isn\u0027t his thing, and spared the reek of the sordid that clouds Ben Roethlisberger\u0027s every move, he\u0027s one of the best politicians in the NFL. No wonder he had an intuitive understanding of how to play his Luke Skywalker role: modestly, sunnily. Always giving the fans the credit, he never even hinted his ambitions could be disentangled from theirs. He grasped that, far more than most QBs, his job wasn\u0027t just athletic but cultural. Funnily enough, that happens to be my own area of expertise.\u000A\u000AAnyhow, those were the days. Four seasons after Super Bowl XLIV, the Saints are 4-5 going into Sunday\u0027s game against the Cincinnati Bengals. If they\u0027re still leading the NFC South, well, that tells you a lot about the NFC South this year: The Falcons, Panthers and Buccaneers\u0027 combined record is 7-20. Overall, the years between 2010 and now haven\u0027t been ecstatic, even if the Saints have managed to make the playoffs all but once. That one absence was in 2012, the year of Bountygate and Sean Payton\u0027s suspension.\u000A\u000AUnlike, say, Rdskns or Cowboys fans in Joe Gibbs\u0027s and Tom Landry\u0027s respective heydays, New Orleanians don\u0027t have the sense of entitlement that makes Super Bowl prospects a given. But they do like feeling special, however that\u0027s defined: special is tattooed into the city\u0027s DNA. Once they got a taste for it, they really dug the once ascendant, now increasingly shaky notion that the Saints are among the NFL\u0027s elite teams.\u000A\u000ABrees is the guy who carries the John Elway-esque burden of keeping the Saints looking exceptional even in years when the team\u0027s stats don\u0027t otherwise bear that out. His own stats, of course, are Hall of Fame stuff in a walk; he holds the all-time NFL record at more feats than you\u0027d care to count. But all the same, when my GQ colleague and pal Andrew Corsello recently made the case for Peyton Manning as The Greatest QB Ever, it didn\u0027t even cross my mind to loyally stick Brees in contention, which was a bummer once I got around to noticing.\u000A\u000AIf he\u0027s not the Drew he used to be, that\u0027s pretty inevitable in a game this punishing. (Then again, compare Peyton Manning.) At 35, Brees isn\u0027t all that young anymore. Even leaving the jind Bountygate season out of it, he sure looks to me as if four years in a row of coming up short have taken a few bites out of his zeal for the game. If he\u0027s not bored, he\u0027s certainly frustrated—maybe not to the churlish extent of blaming his teammates for every setback, the way Brady\u0027s been known to, but close.\u000A\u000AA lot of the time, the stymied effect only shows subtly. But not so long ago, Brees\u0027s unappeasable competitiveness bordered on maniacal. Those genial eyes turned as cold as an assassin\u0027s on game days, and his recklessness under pressure—he\u0027d always sooner throw into coverage than write off a play, and too bad that hasn\u0027t changed—seemed to be a quality neither he nor Sean Payton could control.\u000A\u000AOnce the Saints started floundering this fall, the early-bird speculation was that Brees\u0027s arm was going. But that sounds pretty dumb in light of some of his throws against, say, the 49ers last week, including the Hail Mary touchdown pass to Jimmy Graham that woulda saved the day if it had stayed on the board. So me, I\u0027m wondering if the real factor is mental—that is, whether he just can\u0027t muster his old concentration anymore.\u000A\u000AThe Saints may have a bad habit of only noticing a game is underway sometime between the end of the first quarter and the end of the first half and then intermittently forgetting this interesting truth all over again, but Brees was usually an exception. These days, not so much, and why? For starters, you\u0027ve gotta ask yourself whether there\u0027s such a thing as paying a guy so much money that motivation goes out the window.\u000A\u000ABrees the businessman is definitely looming larger nowadays, and not too attractively. Even though Saints fans went into a tizzy when the team prevaricated about his salary demands—pay him anything he wants, you know?—the megadeal he eventually walked away with didn\u0027t leave such a good taste in their mouths once what it cost to keep Drew happy turned out to have downsides like giving up Darren Sproles to the Eagles. And speaking of bad tastes in people\u0027s mouths, the energy Brees puts into expanding—and flacking for—his crappy Jimmy John\u0027s franchise empire now rivals his efforts on the football field. Since New Orleans dislikes chain restaurants anyway and Jimmy John\u0027s has a rep as being a rotten company to work for, he looks not only greedy but more than a little disloyal to the city\u0027s eccentric spirit.\u000A\u000AIn hindsight, Bountygate looks like more of a turning point for him than was apparent at the time. That wasn\u0027t because Brees was tainted by the scandal—oh, hell, no. In fact, the whole club worked overtime to keep Drew immaculate, no matter how close he\u0027d been to Bountygate poster boy Jonathan Vilma. But Brees wasn\u0027t exactly a profile in courage, either. Protecting his own rep seemed to come first, suggesting that his identification with New Orleans might be less than total after all.\u000A\u000ALet\u0027s also not underestimate the distraction of being an ostentatiously devoted family man, which increases as his little brood grows. Sure, doting fatherhood helps to certify Drew\u0027s good-guy rep, not that we\u0027d give two hoots if the Saints were 8-1 and he couldn\u0027t remember his kids\u0027 names. Yet what may prove more than image-tending is at work is that his focus—as one expert Brees-watcher reminded me—always goes haywire when there\u0027s a new baby in the house he\u0027d rather spend time with.\u000A\u000AThat didn\u0027t stop me from unfollowing him on Twitter when he started using his little darlings to shill for Jimmy John\u0027s, but nobody\u0027s ever called Drew stupid. Although we can hope he\u0027d like one more crack at a Super Bowl ring before time runs out, he\u0027s unmistakably already laying the foundation for his post-football life: lucrative business, rising next generation, the works. That puts him way ahead of the Saints organization, which as far as I can tell hasn\u0027t done squat to ready itself for the post-Brees era.\u000A\u000ASo what if that\u0027s still most likely a few years off? If Payton\u0027s 2012 suspension made Brees\u0027s reliance on him painfully evident—the little-boy-lost faltering was to cringe at—it\u0027s no less true that Payton\u0027s dependence on Brees isn\u0027t totally healthy for a coach who\u0027s supposed to think ahead. The same goes double for a franchise that just doesn\u0027t wanna contemplate life after Drew either.\u000A\u000ASince I can\u0027t help being mischievous, don\u0027t blame me for thinking that all this is no less symbolic than Brees\u0027s starring role in New Orleans\u0027s post-Katrina Cinderella story. Maybe the city\u0027s future doesn\u0027t look so dicey anymore, but recovery has come at a cost: namely, the recognition that good old capitalism has no use for sentimentality. If the Saints are starting to look like just another football franchise—and Brees himself has acquired a suspicious resemblance to one more overpaid, mercenary-in-more-than-one-sense NFL quarterback coasting on past glories even as he plots his post-football future—both transformations make dandy metaphors for the city\u0027s unease about losing its precious uniqueness to a bunch of rapacious out-of-towners eager to turn the joint into a theme park. While that\u0027s hardly the reason I ended up bailing for L.A., whose lack of a pro football team has its silver linings, it does help explain why whatever comes next is something I don\u0027t mind following from a distance.",

Hitt/Getty Images</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.2">Be kind, rewind, and sprinkle some faded confetti on your shoulders as you shlep back along with me to the fall of 2010. The Saints were fresh off winning the Super Bowl, and New Orleanians pretty much wanted carnival season to last all year just so that our funkiest city&#x2019;s paradoxically squeaky-clean quarterback&#x2014;no demons or lubricity for diplomatic, wholesome Drew Brees<em>--</em>could be every Mardi Gras krewe&#x2019;s King of Kings full-time.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.3">Once again, the nation&#x2019;s most insightful news source&#x2014;The Onion&#x2014;nailed it. &quot;<a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/drew-brees-casually-wonders-aloud-if-he-really-cou,18103/">Drew Brees Casually Wonders Aloud If He Really Could Get Away With Murder In This Town</a>.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.5">As it happens, I&#x2019;d just moved to New Orleans that year. The Saints even had something to do with that, since I&#x2019;d fallen in love with the place while watching them beat the R<em>dsk</em>ns&#x2014;supposedly, my hometown team, but a putz as utterly grotesque as Dan Snyder can take a lot out of a guy&#x2014;during their &#x2019;09 Super Bowl run. Because converts make the best zealots, I was as ready as anyone in the Crescent City to believe Brees jogged on water&#x2014;or Katrina&#x2019;s floodwaters, anyway.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.6">It&#x2019;s not news that the Saints&#x2019; fortunes are entwined with the city&#x2019;s more intimately than is true of most NFL teams. That&#x2019;s why fanhood there is so lyrical; this was true even when they were midway between being punching bags and punchlines. Their victorious return to the refurbished Superdome in 2006 is enshrined in civic legend as the beginning of the city&#x2019;s post-hurricane resurrection. Owner Tom Benson&#x2019;s rumored scheme to relocate &amp;#x2018;em the hell to San Antonio in Katrina&#x2019;s aftermath got airbrushed right out of local history by Super Bowl euphoria.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.7">Brees, of course, knew all about being damaged goods, considering that his career prospects hadn&#x2019;t looked too good after the Chargers dumped him in &#x2019;05. Besides the Miami Dolphins, who were kind of grudging about it, the hard-luck Saints were the only team that wanted him at all. That made him a natural as the figurative and then literal MVP of New Orleans&#x2019;s comeback saga.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.8">Personable the way Tom Brady isn&#x2019;t, because petulance isn&#x2019;t his thing, and spared the reek of the sordid that clouds Ben Roethlisberger&#x2019;s every move, he&#x2019;s one of the best politicians in the NFL. No wonder he had an intuitive understanding of how to play his Luke Skywalker role: modestly, sunnily. Always giving the fans the credit, he never even hinted his ambitions could be disentangled from theirs. He grasped that, far more than most QBs, his job wasn&#x2019;t just athletic but cultural. Funnily enough, that happens to be my own area of expertise.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.9">Anyhow, those were the days. Four seasons after Super Bowl XLIV, the Saints are 4-5 going into Sunday&#x2019;s game against the Cincinnati Bengals. If they&#x2019;re still leading the NFC South, well, that tells you a lot about the NFC South this year: The Falcons, Panthers and Buccaneers&#x2019; combined record is 7-20. Overall, the years between 2010 and now haven&#x2019;t been ecstatic, even if the Saints have managed to make the playoffs all but once. That one absence was in 2012, the year of Bountygate and Sean Payton&#x2019;s suspension.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.a">Unlike, say, R<em>dsk</em>ns or Cowboys fans in Joe Gibbs&#x2019;s and Tom Landry&#x2019;s respective heydays, New Orleanians don&#x2019;t have the sense of entitlement that makes Super Bowl prospects a given. But they do like feeling <em>special, </em>however that&#x2019;s defined: special is tattooed into the city&#x2019;s DNA. Once they got a taste for it, they really dug the once ascendant, now increasingly shaky notion that the Saints are among the NFL&#x2019;s elite teams.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.b">Brees is the guy who carries the John Elway-esque burden of keeping the Saints looking exceptional even in years when the team&#x2019;s stats don&#x2019;t otherwise bear that out. His own stats, of course, are Hall of Fame stuff in a walk; he holds the all-time NFL record at more feats than you&#x2019;d care to count. But all the same, when my GQ colleague and pal Andrew Corsello <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/sports/201401/peyton-manning-best-quarterback-all-time">recently made the case for Peyton Manning as The Greatest QB Ever</a>, it didn&#x2019;t even cross my mind to loyally stick Brees in contention, which was a bummer once I got around to noticing.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.c">If he&#x2019;s not the Drew he used to be, that&#x2019;s pretty inevitable in a game this punishing. (Then again, compare Peyton Manning.) At 35, Brees isn&#x2019;t all that young anymore. Even leaving the jind Bountygate season out of it, he sure looks to me as if four years in a row of coming up short have taken a few bites out of his zeal for the game. If he&#x2019;s not bored, he&#x2019;s certainly frustrated&#x2014;maybe not to the churlish extent of blaming his teammates for every setback, the way Brady&#x2019;s been known to, but close.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.d">A lot of the time, the stymied effect only shows subtly. But not so long ago, Brees&#x2019;s unappeasable competitiveness bordered on maniacal. Those genial eyes turned as cold as an assassin&#x2019;s on game days, and his recklessness under pressure&#x2014;he&#x2019;d always sooner throw into coverage than write off a play, and too bad <em>that </em>hasn&#x2019;t changed&#x2014;seemed to be a quality neither he nor Sean Payton could control.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.e">Once the Saints started floundering this fall, the early-bird speculation was that Brees&#x2019;s arm was going. But that sounds pretty dumb in light of some of his throws against, say, the 49ers last week, including the Hail Mary touchdown pass to Jimmy Graham that woulda saved the day if it had stayed on the board. So me, I&#x2019;m wondering if the real factor is mental&#x2014;that is, whether he just can&#x2019;t muster his old concentration anymore.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.f">The Saints may have a bad habit of only noticing a game is underway sometime between the end of the first quarter and the end of the first half and then intermittently forgetting this interesting truth all over again, but Brees was usually an exception. These days, not so much, and why? For starters, you&#x2019;ve gotta ask yourself whether there&#x2019;s such a thing as paying a guy so much money that motivation goes out the window.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.g">Brees the businessman is definitely looming larger nowadays, and not too attractively. Even though Saints fans went into a tizzy when the team prevaricated about his salary demands&#x2014;pay him <em>anything he wants, </em>you know?&#x2014;the megadeal he eventually walked away with didn&#x2019;t leave such a good taste in their mouths once what it cost to keep Drew happy turned out to have downsides like giving up Darren Sproles to the Eagles. And speaking of bad tastes in people&#x2019;s mouths, the energy Brees puts into expanding&#x2014;and flacking for&#x2014;his crappy Jimmy John&#x2019;s franchise empire now rivals his efforts on the football field. Since New Orleans dislikes chain restaurants anyway and Jimmy John&#x2019;s has a rep as being a rotten company to work for, he looks not only greedy but more than a little disloyal to the city&#x2019;s eccentric spirit.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.h">In hindsight, Bountygate looks like more of a turning point for him than was apparent at the time. That wasn&#x2019;t because Brees was tainted by the scandal&#x2014;oh, hell, no. In fact, the whole club worked overtime to keep Drew immaculate, no matter how close he&#x2019;d been to Bountygate poster boy Jonathan Vilma. But Brees wasn&#x2019;t exactly a profile in courage, either. Protecting his own rep seemed to come first, suggesting that his identification with New Orleans might be less than total after all.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.i">Let&#x2019;s also not underestimate the distraction of being an ostentatiously devoted family man, which increases as his little brood grows. Sure, doting fatherhood helps to certify Drew&#x2019;s good-guy rep, not that we&#x2019;d give two hoots if the Saints were 8-1 and he couldn&#x2019;t remember his kids&#x2019; names. Yet what may prove more than image-tending is at work is that his focus&#x2014;as one expert Brees-watcher reminded me&#x2014;always goes haywire when there&#x2019;s a new baby in the house he&#x2019;d rather spend time with.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.j">That didn&#x2019;t stop me from unfollowing him on Twitter when he started using his little darlings to shill for Jimmy John&#x2019;s, but nobody&#x2019;s ever called Drew stupid. Although we can hope he&#x2019;d like one more crack at a Super Bowl ring before time runs out, he&#x2019;s unmistakably already laying the foundation for his post-football life: lucrative business, rising next generation, the works. That puts him way ahead of the Saints organization, which as far as I can tell hasn&#x2019;t done squat to ready itself for the post-Brees era.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.k">So what if that&#x2019;s still most likely a few years off? If Payton&#x2019;s 2012 suspension made Brees&#x2019;s reliance on him painfully evident&#x2014;the little-boy-lost faltering was to cringe at&#x2014;it&#x2019;s no less true that Payton&#x2019;s dependence on Brees isn&#x2019;t totally healthy for a coach who&#x2019;s supposed to think ahead. The same goes double for a franchise that just doesn&#x2019;t wanna contemplate life after Drew either.</p><p data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.4.l">Since I can&#x2019;t help being mischievous, don&#x2019;t blame me for thinking that all this is no less symbolic than Brees&#x2019;s starring role in New Orleans&#x2019;s post-Katrina Cinderella story. Maybe the city&#x2019;s future doesn&#x2019;t look so dicey anymore, but recovery has come at a cost: namely, the recognition that good old capitalism has no use for sentimentality. If the Saints are starting to look like just another football franchise&#x2014;and Brees himself has acquired a suspicious resemblance to one more overpaid, mercenary-in-more-than-one-sense NFL quarterback coasting on past glories even as he plots his post-football future&#x2014;both transformations make dandy metaphors for the city&#x2019;s unease about losing its precious uniqueness to a bunch of rapacious out-of-towners eager to turn the joint into a theme park. While that&#x2019;s hardly the reason I ended up bailing for L.A., whose lack of a pro football team has its silver linings, it does help explain why whatever comes next is something I don&#x2019;t mind following from a distance.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".1sxtcdbcao0.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
