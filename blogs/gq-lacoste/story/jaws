  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestPhoto: AP\u000A\u000A  _Jaws\u0027s Ten Most Influential Style Moments_\u000A\u000AListen, my fellow obsessives, gathered by Amity Island\u0027s beach-party firelight as the waves out there gently lap to the beat of John Williams\u0027s distant bass ostinato: There are ancient stories about southern women who ponied up to see Gone with the Wind dozens of times just to bask in Scarlett O\u0027Hara\u0027s wardrobe. But we are not like those dames—no, sir. Not at all.\u000A\u000ATrue, in the forty years since Steven Spielberg\u0027s great-white-shark epic came out—and turned GWTW\u0027s box-office stats into so much chum—any number of us have watched Robert Shaw\u0027s shark-hunting Quint get Bruced to death at least as often. All the same, it\u0027s safe to say few of us have found ourselves wondering even once where Roy Scheider got his sweater. Talking about Jaws as a fashion document—let alone an influence on men\u0027s style—is a surefire way of guaranteeing the old side eye from people who cheerfully trusted your intellect up to a few seconds ago.\u000A\u000AThe only discussion of anyone\u0027s sartorial proclivities in the dialogue is one line of Quint\u0027s: \u0022I\u0027ll never put on a life jacket again.\u0022 From a Project Runway point of view, there\u0027s not much to say otherwise except that Shaw looks good modeling sharkskin as Quint meets his maker. The ensemble\u0027s top and bottom halves don\u0027t match—men can be such clots about this stuff, right?—but the blood is a reconciling touch Heidi Klum might admire. Auf Wiedersehen!\u000A\u000AOr so you might think. But let us stipulate, first, that Jaws is an almost perfect movie. It really is. Back in my embryo days of sorting out my own taste—just add argumentativeness and you too can grow up to be a movie reviewer, my child—it was a big deal for me to realize how vastly I preferred 1975 Spielberg\u0027s fish story to my former demigod Robert Altman\u0027s Nashville, released the very same year. Jaws wasn\u0027t just miles better at delivering on what it promised, but a truer portrait of the state of the union the year after Nixon resigned.\u000A\u000ALet us agree, second, that Jaws is an almost perfect movie contrasting three styles of masculinity: Quint\u0027s snaggletoothed, ornery, and half-cracked macho; Richard Dreyfuss/Matt Hooper\u0027s post-counterculture combo of teddy-bear cuddliness and testy smarts; and Scheider/Chief Brody\u0027s unassuming incarnation of thinking-man resolve minus Quint\u0027s Pleistocene-era braggadocio. And now let us conclude that Jaws attains its near perfection in part by contrasting those three styles of masculinity via the trio\u0027s clothing.\u000A\u000AIf somebody had the wit to open a men\u0027s boutique called Brody, Quint, and Hooper, not only would we flock to it like lemmings; we\u0027d know in advance which display rack to head for. It\u0027d be like the grown-up—well, relatively speaking—version of claiming our house at Hogwarts.\u000A\u000AAs post-macho as the Pillsbury Doughboy with a postgraduate degree, Dreyfuss\u0027s Matt Hooper is the easiest to identify with if you\u0027re fresh off a campus. From his jean jacket and frat-house sweatshirts to his fuzzy barbering and dopey wool and then fisherman\u0027s caps, everything about his appearance seemingly confirms Quint\u0027s opinion that he\u0027s, y\u0027know, soft. If you\u0027re in any doubt about Spielberg\u0027s attention to detail, an alternate take included in the latest Jaws Blu-ray introduces Hooper wearing sunglasses, but they\u0027re gone in the release version. Unka Steven didn\u0027t want him looking too cool.\u000A\u000AHooper\u0027s sarcastic brain has to fight its way out of his nubby looks like a rabbit peeking out of a hutch, which was very much the hip style of the time. Remember, Woody Allen was a college hero then—and even though Hooper\u0027s C.V. suggests he is an upper-crust goy, Richard Dreyfuss certainly wasn\u0027t. Just like Mike Nichols shrewdly using Dustin Hoffman as the world\u0027s least likely suburban Gentile in The Graduate, casting a Waspier actor would have turned Hooper from plucky to obnoxious.\u000A\u000AOne of the movie\u0027s small wardrobe triumphs is his slicked-down hair and awkward coat and tie when he visits the Brody house. It resembles a costume because that\u0027s what it is to him; back in their undergrad days, wiseacres his age thought they could get away with never dressing up again. But Hooper looks like a nebbish even in the wet suit he dons to gutsily submerge in the shark cage, and of course that\u0027s the point.\u000A\u000AQuint, on the other hand, wouldn\u0027t be caught wearing a tie at his own funeral. Everything about his garb tells you that he\u0027s no more concerned than the Unabomber with impersonating a social creature, and that clearly includes winning favor with the opposite sex. His sour jokes and ditties about women are the curdled japes of a man who\u0027s not only given up on companionship but thinks he\u0027s seen through the whole idiot game. His signature long-billed cap signals isolation, not approachability; it\u0027s actually fairly funny that Hooper and Brody risk sunstroke by staying hatless while at sea in what\u0027s supposed to be July.\u000A\u000AMeanwhile, Quint\u0027s blue work shirt, augmented by a gamy-looking military-surplus jacket, both reminds us of the class distinctions between the three men—if Hooper is a rich college kid, Brody is as middle-class as can be—and subtly prepares us for the revelations of this WWII vet\u0027s Indianapolis speech. Even when he wears an apron, as he does while boiling sharks\u0027 jaws before the three men set out aboard the Orca, it doesn\u0027t exactly domesticate him. He\u0027s a saltwater version of Vulcan at his forge, and the turtleneck sweater he\u0027s got on underneath—it\u0027s the one time he swaps grunge for showiness—turns him kingly.\u000A\u000ABrody, however, is the only one who evolves—and it\u0027s fun to see how his wardrobe reflects that. Boy, is Scheider happy to graduate to his trim third-act T-shirt and jeans after spending the bulk of the movie in Brody\u0027s cop uniform and unhip windbreakers, followed by comically overcompensating rubber pants and boots. Maybe Amity\u0027s police chief is a landlubber, but he sure turns out to be an elegant one. By the climax, Scheider\u0027s moves are already halfway to those of the virile-but-graceful choreographer he played in Bob Fosse\u0027s All That Jazz four years later.\u000A\u000AThe larger message conveyed by Jaws\u0027 variations on masculine style must\u0027ve gladdened the hearts of perceptive fashion mavens everywhere. To wit, the \u002760s were over; we were done with all that funky alternativism and hippie crap. The kids at the beach party may toke up and have long hair, but radicals they aren\u0027t. Even though Brody is a proud inhabitant of Squaresville and a representative of officialdom right down to his unhip duds, that doesn\u0027t make the movie hostile to him—far from it—and it doesn\u0027t trigger Hooper\u0027s youth-culture antagonism. Instead, they\u0027re instant allies.\u000A\u000AIn fact, it\u0027s only a slight exaggeration to say that Brody was the first good cop to be so prominently championed on America\u0027s movie screens in several years. For that matter, Hooper\u0027s privileged background isn\u0027t held against him, either. No less significantly, each man is a product of a different era. If Quint was formed in the \u002740s, Brody is unmistakably a product of the Eisenhower years, and Hooper\u0027s a child of the \u002760s.\u000A\u000ANonetheless, Quint the dinosaur is the only one who dies. When Brody and Hooper re-encounter each other with downright tender affection after the shark\u0027s been blasted sky-high, it\u0027s the reconciliation of middle-American virtue and countercultural uppitiness after a decade\u0027s worth of sparring. Audiences in 1975 may have registered this only subliminally—and Spielberg himself may not have been conscious of it—but it\u0027s not the least ingredient of the movie\u0027s appeal.\u000A\u000AAs for that appeal\u0027s durability, isn\u0027t one reason our sense even forty years later that Quint, Brody, and Hooper—the guy-flick equivalent of the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion—are still the only options available to us as we decide how to manifest ourselves in this discomfiting world? If the 2015 versions of Quint are Duck Dynasty\u0027s Robertson clan—and jeez, we have gone downhill, haven\u0027t we?—that may just prove that dinosaurs only die in the movies. But now no less than back then, Chief Brody\u0027s anti-chic windbreakers and Matt Hooper\u0027s wool cap don\u0027t look so ill-suited to all sorts of weather, literal or otherwise.",

But we are not like those dames&#x2014;no, sir. Not at all.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.3">True, in the forty years since Steven Spielberg&#x2019;s great-white-shark epic came out&#x2014;and turned <em>GWTW&#x2019;</em>s box-office stats into so much chum&#x2014;any number of us have watched Robert Shaw&#x2019;s shark-hunting Quint get Bruced to death at least as often. All the same, it&#x2019;s safe to say few of us have found ourselves wondering even once where Roy Scheider got his sweater. Talking about <em>Jaws</em> as a fashion document&#x2014;let alone an influence on men&#x2019;s style&#x2014;is a surefire way of guaranteeing the old side eye from people who cheerfully trusted your intellect up to a few seconds ago.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.5">The only discussion of anyone&#x2019;s sartorial proclivities in the dialogue is one line of Quint&#x2019;s: &quot;I&#x2019;ll never put on a life jacket again.&quot; From a <em>Project Runway</em> point of view, there&#x2019;s not much to say otherwise except that Shaw looks good modeling sharkskin as Quint meets his maker. The ensemble&#x2019;s top and bottom halves don&#x2019;t match&#x2014;men can be such clots about this stuff, right?&#x2014;but the blood is a reconciling touch Heidi Klum might admire. <em>Auf Wiedersehen!</em></p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.6">Or so you might think. But let us stipulate, first, that <em>Jaws</em> is an almost perfect movie. It really is. Back in my embryo days of sorting out my own taste&#x2014;just add argumentativeness and you too can grow up to be a movie reviewer, my child&#x2014;it was a big deal for me to realize how vastly I preferred 1975 Spielberg&#x2019;s fish story to my former demigod Robert Altman&#x2019;s <em>Nashville,</em> released the very same year. <em>Jaws</em> wasn&#x2019;t just miles better at delivering on what it promised, but a truer portrait of the state of the union the year after Nixon resigned.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.7">Let us agree, second, that <em>Jaws</em> is an almost perfect movie contrasting three styles of masculinity: Quint&#x2019;s snaggletoothed, ornery, and half-cracked macho; Richard Dreyfuss/Matt Hooper&#x2019;s post-counterculture combo of teddy-bear cuddliness and testy smarts; and Scheider/Chief Brody&#x2019;s unassuming incarnation of thinking-man resolve minus Quint&#x2019;s Pleistocene-era braggadocio. And now let us conclude that <em>Jaws</em> attains its near perfection in part by contrasting those three styles of masculinity via the trio&#x2019;s clothing.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.8">If somebody had the wit to open a men&#x2019;s boutique called Brody, Quint, and Hooper, not only would we flock to it like lemmings; we&#x2019;d know in advance which display rack to head for. It&#x2019;d be like the grown-up&#x2014;well, relatively speaking&#x2014;version of claiming our house at Hogwarts.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.9">As post-macho as the Pillsbury Doughboy with a postgraduate degree, Dreyfuss&#x2019;s Matt Hooper is the easiest to identify with if you&#x2019;re fresh off a campus. From his jean jacket and frat-house sweatshirts to his fuzzy barbering and dopey wool and then fisherman&#x2019;s caps, everything about his appearance seemingly confirms Quint&#x2019;s opinion that he&#x2019;s, y&#x2019;know, <em>soft.</em> If you&#x2019;re in any doubt about Spielberg&#x2019;s attention to detail, an alternate take included in the latest <em>Jaws</em> Blu-ray introduces Hooper wearing sunglasses, but they&#x2019;re gone in the release version. Unka Steven didn&#x2019;t want him looking too cool.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.a">Hooper&#x2019;s sarcastic brain has to fight its way out of his nubby looks like a rabbit peeking out of a hutch, which was very much the hip style of the time. Remember, Woody Allen was a college hero then&#x2014;and even though Hooper&#x2019;s C.V. suggests he is an upper-crust goy, Richard Dreyfuss certainly wasn&#x2019;t. Just like Mike Nichols shrewdly using Dustin Hoffman as the world&#x2019;s least likely suburban Gentile in <em>The Graduate,</em> casting a Waspier actor would have turned Hooper from plucky to obnoxious.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.b">One of the movie&#x2019;s small wardrobe triumphs is his slicked-down hair and awkward coat and tie when he visits the Brody house. It resembles a costume because that&#x2019;s what it is to him; back in their undergrad days, wiseacres his age thought they could get away with never dressing up again. But Hooper looks like a nebbish even in the wet suit he dons to gutsily submerge in the shark cage, and of course that&#x2019;s the point.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.c">Quint, on the other hand, wouldn&#x2019;t be caught wearing a tie at his own funeral. Everything about his garb tells you that he&#x2019;s no more concerned than the Unabomber with impersonating a social creature, and that clearly includes winning favor with the opposite sex. His sour jokes and ditties about women are the curdled japes of a man who&#x2019;s not only given up on companionship but thinks he&#x2019;s seen through the whole idiot game. His signature long-billed cap signals isolation, not approachability; it&#x2019;s actually fairly funny that Hooper and Brody risk sunstroke by staying hatless while at sea in what&#x2019;s supposed to be July.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.d">Meanwhile, Quint&#x2019;s blue work shirt, augmented by a gamy-looking military-surplus jacket, both reminds us of the class distinctions between the three men&#x2014;if Hooper is a rich college kid, Brody is as middle-class as can be&#x2014;and subtly prepares us for the revelations of this WWII vet&#x2019;s <em>Indianapolis</em> speech. Even when he wears an apron, as he does while boiling sharks&#x2019; jaws before the three men set out aboard the <em>Orca,</em> it doesn&#x2019;t exactly domesticate him. He&#x2019;s a saltwater version of Vulcan at his forge, and the turtleneck sweater he&#x2019;s got on underneath&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the one time he swaps grunge for showiness&#x2014;turns him kingly.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.e">Brody, however, is the only one who <em>evolves</em>&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s fun to see how his wardrobe reflects that. Boy, is Scheider happy to graduate to his trim third-act T-shirt and jeans after spending the bulk of the movie in Brody&#x2019;s cop uniform and unhip windbreakers, followed by comically overcompensating rubber pants and boots. Maybe Amity&#x2019;s police chief is a landlubber, but he sure turns out to be an elegant one. By the climax, Scheider&#x2019;s moves are already halfway to those of the virile-but-graceful choreographer he played in Bob Fosse&#x2019;s <em>All That Jazz</em> four years later.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.f">The larger message conveyed by <em>Jaws&#x2019;</em> variations on masculine style must&#x2019;ve gladdened the hearts of perceptive fashion mavens everywhere. To wit, the &#x2019;60s were over; we were done with all that funky alternativism and hippie crap. The kids at the beach party may toke up and have long hair, but radicals they aren&#x2019;t. Even though Brody is a proud inhabitant of Squaresville and a representative of officialdom right down to his unhip duds, that doesn&#x2019;t make the movie hostile to him&#x2014;far from it&#x2014;and it doesn&#x2019;t trigger Hooper&#x2019;s youth-culture antagonism. Instead, they&#x2019;re instant allies.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.g">In fact, it&#x2019;s only a slight exaggeration to say that Brody was the first <em>good</em> cop to be so prominently championed on America&#x2019;s movie screens in several years. For that matter, Hooper&#x2019;s privileged background isn&#x2019;t held against him, either. No less significantly, each man is a product of a different era. If Quint was formed in the &#x2019;40s, Brody is unmistakably a product of the Eisenhower years, and Hooper&#x2019;s a child of the &#x2019;60s.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.h">Nonetheless, Quint the dinosaur is the only one who dies. When Brody and Hooper re-encounter each other with downright tender affection after the shark&#x2019;s been blasted sky-high, it&#x2019;s the reconciliation of middle-American virtue and countercultural uppitiness after a decade&#x2019;s worth of sparring. Audiences in 1975 may have registered this only subliminally&#x2014;and Spielberg himself may not have been conscious of it&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s not the least ingredient of the movie&#x2019;s appeal.</p><p data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.4.i">As for that appeal&#x2019;s durability, isn&#x2019;t one reason our sense even forty years later that Quint, Brody, and Hooper&#x2014;the guy-flick equivalent of the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion&#x2014;are still the only options available to us as we decide how to manifest ourselves in this discomfiting world? If the 2015 versions of Quint are <em>Duck Dynasty&#x2019;</em>s Robertson clan&#x2014;and jeez, we <em>have</em> gone downhill, haven&#x2019;t we?&#x2014;that may just prove that dinosaurs only die in the movies. But now no less than back then, Chief Brody&#x2019;s anti-chic windbreakers and Matt Hooper&#x2019;s wool cap don&#x2019;t look so ill-suited to all sorts of weather, literal or otherwise.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".2ccultp9o8w.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
