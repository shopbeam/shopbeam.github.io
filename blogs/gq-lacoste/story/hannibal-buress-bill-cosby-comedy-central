  	    "articleBody": "Just in case you were wondering—and you weren\u0027t—it is not easy to put names up on a marquee, different ones every day, especially at a place like The Comedy Store. If you\u0027ve never passed that particular marquee on Sunset Boulevard, if you\u0027ve never seen it through the cloud of marijuana smoke that emanates from beneath it, it\u0027s two-sided, totally analog, five different names per night, each painstakingly applied, letter by letter, by the kind of comedy-upstart tweaky stoner lackey kid whom I happen to be engaged in conversation with at this very minute.\u000A\u000AIt is evening, and I\u0027ve been overhearing him tell passersby that Hannibal Buress, the Hannibal Buress, is going to be here tonight, totally stealth, almost like a secret show. I ask the lackey why, given the relative paucity of marquee names worth trumpeting on a comedy-club marquee, Hannibal\u0027s isn\u0027t up there. The lackey confides to me that he had just finished putting up Hannibal\u0027s name that morning—his least favorite part of the day, in case we haven\u0027t established that already—when he got a call to take Hannibal\u0027s name down. \u0022He\u0027s trying out some new material,\u0022 the lackey stage-whispers, and obviously it is well-known that well-known comics at Hannibal\u0027s level don\u0027t try out new stuff loudly; they do it quietly.\u000A\u000A\u0022But also\u0022—and here the lackey summons the air of someone who knows things—\u0022it\u0027s the Cosby stuff. He\u0027s paranoid about it.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHannibal Buress is famous now. He was already getting pretty famous before the Cosby stuff blew up, but now it\u0027s to the point where people want to talk to him all the time, and this is not easy for him. They approach him at concerts when he\u0027s just trying to enjoy the show, just \u0022vibing out, motherfucker.\u0022 There was an incident in April where a guy who wanted a picture wouldn\u0027t wait for Buress to finish a \u0022top-five-ever\u0022 plate of post-show wings at a bar near the venue and kept nagging at him until Buress manually refunded the guy\u0027s ticket by throwing $26 into his face.\u000A\u000AStill, he tells me after his set at The Comedy Store, he is trying to be nicer. He is trying to breathe through the frustration of people being too enthusiastic/too wrong/too human around him. Sometimes people recognize him from Broad City—he plays Ilana Glazer\u0027s not-quite-boyfriend, Lincoln—and they\u0027ll call him by his character\u0027s name, and usually he\u0027s like, \u0022That\u0027s not my name. That\u0027s a character I play on TV.\u0022 But he\u0027s softening. The next time it happens, \u0022I think I might just go, ‘Hey, what\u0027s up?\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000AWhen I tell Buress what the lackey kid said to me—that his name isn\u0027t on the marquee because of the Cosby stuff—he registers it with less annoyance than I expected. His face is a little inscrutable, the defining characteristic of his countenance being a not-typical-of-comics laconic chill, but he barely rolls his eyes at this.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u0022That\u0027s not why,\u0022 he says. \u0022It\u0027s because they\u0027re not paying me enough.\u0022\u000A\u000AIf they want to put his name on the marquee, Buress tells me, he has to be headlining. Even if it\u0027s just for a secret show, the tickets need to cost what tickets to a Hannibal Buress show cost. He would have brought the DJ he travels with if this were a Hannibal Buress show. He might have hired some ballerinas, which is also a thing he does on occasion, but only when it\u0027s a Hannibal Buress show. Nah, this is just a quick set, in and out.\u000A\u000AIn the past year, Buress has gone from cult comic to mainstream star. He was already familiar to people who watch Broad City or The Eric Andre Show, which he\u0027s co-hosted for three years, or who listen to podcasts like Marc Maron\u0027s or The Nerdist or The Joe Rogan Experience. He\u0027d done time in the writers\u0027 room on Saturday Night Live (\u0022It wasn\u0027t for me. I didn\u0027t apply myself as much as I could\u0027ve. Maybe I didn\u0027t enjoy the place that much\u0022) and 30 Rock (\u002230 Rock I enjoyed—they\u0027d probably say nice things about me, but they won\u0027t say that I was a great sitcom writer\u0022). Then came the hour-long specials, and slowly the venues went from clubs to sold-out theaters. He went from don\u0027t-I-know-you-from-somewhere to oh-my-God-it\u0027s-Hannibal-Buress. Now he has his own show on Comedy Central, Why? with Hannibal Buress, a weekly variety show of sorts that incorporates man-on-the-street interviews, filmed segments, and bits of his stand-up.\u000A\u000AThis steady rise was already peaking last fall when some shaky footage surfaced online of a bit Buress had been doing for a few weeks, one in which he mentions that Bill Cosby has no real right to tell black people how to behave—to pull up their pants and so forth—because \u0022you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches.\u0022 The shock of the line would always get a laugh, and in case anyone thought he was just joking, he would double down: \u0022When you leave here, Google ‘Bill Cosby rape.\u0027 That shit has more results than ‘Hannibal Buress.\u0027 \u0022\u000A\u000ANow, we\u0027d known, or at least kind of known, about Cosby. We\u0027d heard accusations. Yet somehow the world hadn\u0027t been ready to face the possibility that our own Dr. Huxtable—do you remember that he played an obstetrician? a specialty in which one drugs women and handles their genitals, a big fuck-you to us all—the man who made TV safe for middle-class black families, was raping women. But it was a different time now. Hannibal had shaken us awake. We were listening.\u000A\u000AThe clip was passed around by just about everyone with a Facebook account, and suddenly, a storm: CNN panels were convened night after night. More than forty women came forward to tell their frighteningly similar stories about how Cosby had allegedly drugged and assaulted them. State laws were changed to extend statutes of limitation from what they were when we\u0027d first ignored allegations that Cosby was a demented excuse for a human. CBS News posted a story called \u0022Who is Hannibal Buress, and why did he call Bill Cosby a ‘rapist\u0027?\u0022\u000A\u000AAnd, says Buress, it halted Comedy Central\u0027s announcement of Hannibal\u0027s new TV show. The hope was to put a pin in the press release until the craziness died down, until Hannibal Buress\u0027s name was no longer associated with that sick fucker Bill Cosby\u0027s.\u000A\u000ABut that never happened—at least, it still hasn\u0027t—and so when the show was finally announced, Buress got tweets and e-mails that said things like, \u0022You fucking sold out Cosby and now you got a show.\u0022 Because, reader, there are still people rooting for Bill Cosby. \u0022This deal closed, like, June of last year,\u0022 Buress says. \u0022That person can\u0027t be argued with.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AHannibal Buress was on the debate team in high school in Chicago when he realized he could make people laugh. I tell you this in order to emphasize that congeniality maybe doesn\u0027t come so naturally to a guy whose main comedic jam is parsing things people say and do and then correcting them. \u0022I wouldn\u0027t say I\u0027m combative,\u0022 he says, \u0022but, like, when people say something that\u0027s wrong, I\u0027m one to correct them.\u0022 Buress is like the smart-aleck kid brother who harps on your every error and hyperbolic moment, and who would be insufferable if he weren\u0027t incredibly funny. But as I said: He\u0027s learning, taking it one day at a time. (He hates that phrase, by the way, \u0022taking it one day at a time\u0022: \u0022You know who else is? Everybody. Cuz that\u0027s how time works. That\u0027s the only way you can take time.\u0022)\u000A\u000AI\u0027d first met Buress at the production offices for Why? on the Paramount lot. He greeted me warmly, and when I sat down and pulled my tape recorder out, he pulled out his iPhone and hit record, too. \u0022Isn\u0027t this what Beyoncé does?\u0022 he asked me. His office is corporate, standard-issue Paramount, a used couch and a cheap desk and a wipeboard with ideas on it like \u0022Urban Elephant Joke Jam\u0022 and \u0022Coffee Civil Rights.\u0022\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AHe wore a large gold Orefici watch and a black Hundreds T-shirt, jeans, and gray ankle boots. His appearance has changed over the years. He\u0027s gotten Lasik, and also veneers—his \u0022TV teeth,\u0022 as he calls them—to correct the gap in the front. He tells me he plans to slim down for the show because he\u0027s worried that he\u0027s gotten fat. I tell him he can do that because he\u0027s a man, just lose weight at a moment\u0027s notice, and he tells me, no, he can do it because he is capable of hard work.\u000A\u000AI had been warned going in that Buress would shut down if I brought up the Cosby stuff. That\u0027s not true. It\u0027s that he\u0027ll shut down if you ask him stupid questions about the Cosby stuff. He\u0027ll talk about it when he can be funny. (At Justin Bieber\u0027s roast: \u0022I hate your music more than Bill Cosby hates my comedy.\u0022) And he\u0027ll talk about it when he\u0027s asked thoughtfully. (To Howard Stern: \u0022That wasn\u0027t my intention, to make it a part of a big discussion. It was just something I was doing at that venue right then.\u0022) But when he was doing a phone interview in March to promote a show in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and the reporter alluded to it in a way that Buress didn\u0027t like, he hung up on the guy. \u0022I don\u0027t want to talk about it with you\u0022 is how he explained the incident to me, \u0022[because you\u0027re] being a dick.\u0022\u000A\u000AI asked him if he regretted that Cosby bit, and he said he didn\u0027t, because \u0022you can\u0027t predict shit like that.\u0022 But I pressed him. Did he realize he was a feminist hero? I actually said that: \u0022You are a feminist hero,\u0022 I told him, and meanwhile he smiled slightly and looked down and bobbed his head slowly like he was considering something. \u0022People are going to put on you whatever they want to put on you. It is conflicting, because people think I\u0027m like this amazing guy or something.\u0022 He laughs. \u0022I\u0027m a decent guy.\u0022 The thing is, though, he\u0027s not in comedy to be decent—he\u0027s in it to be funny. And he\u0027s realizing how hard it is for people to think of you as funny when your name keeps showing up in sentences alongside the word rape.\u000A\u000AHe is too smart at this point to pontificate on Bill Cosby with a tape recorder running. He\u0027s done enough interviews to know that a quote you never give cannot be taken out of context. Still, the net result is the same: You open up your GQ, and the Hannibal Buress story is about Bill Cosby. I hope Buress will like it, but if he doesn\u0027t, I hope he\u0027ll understand. He brought something we\u0027d ignored to national attention. He helped begin the closure process for possibly dozens of victims. And he did all of it while being funny. What kind of comedian\u0027s estimation of himself does not leave room for a random monologue to change the world?\u000A\u000AAnd yet, finally, despite his efforts to be nicer, to be more forgiving, to let go, he spreads his arms out wide and looks up at the ceiling and says not so much to me but to everyone, everywhere: \u0022I don\u0027t know what the fuck else you want me to say.\u0022",

If you&apos;ve never passed that particular marquee on Sunset Boulevard, if you&apos;ve never seen it through the cloud of marijuana smoke that emanates from beneath it, it&apos;s two-sided, totally analog, five different names per night, each painstakingly applied, letter by letter, by the kind of comedy-upstart tweaky stoner lackey kid whom I happen to be engaged in conversation with at this very minute.</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.1">It is evening, and I&apos;ve been overhearing him tell passersby that Hannibal Buress, <em>the</em> Hannibal Buress, is going to be here tonight, totally stealth, almost like a secret show. I ask the lackey why, given the relative paucity of marquee names worth trumpeting on a comedy-club marquee, Hannibal&apos;s isn&apos;t up there. The lackey confides to me that he had just finished putting up Hannibal&apos;s name that morning&#x2014;his least favorite part of the day, in case we haven&apos;t established that already&#x2014;when he got a call to take Hannibal&apos;s name down. &quot;He&apos;s trying out some new material,&quot; the lackey stage-whispers, and obviously it is well-known that well-known comics at Hannibal&apos;s level don&apos;t try out new stuff loudly; they do it quietly.</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.2">&quot;But also&quot;&#x2014;and here the lackey summons the air of someone who knows things&#x2014;&quot;it&apos;s the Cosby stuff.

He was already getting pretty famous before the Cosby stuff blew up, but now it&apos;s to the point where people want to talk to him all the time, and this is not easy for him. They approach him at concerts when he&apos;s just trying to enjoy the show, just &quot;vibing out, motherfucker.&quot; There was an incident in April where a guy who wanted a picture wouldn&apos;t wait for Buress to finish a &quot;top-five-ever&quot; plate of post-show wings at a bar near the venue and kept nagging at him until Buress manually refunded the guy&apos;s ticket by throwing $26 into his face.</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.7">Still, he tells me after his set at The Comedy Store, he is trying to be nicer. He is trying to breathe through the frustration of people being too enthusiastic/too wrong/too human around him. Sometimes people recognize him from <em>Broad City</em>&#x2014;he plays Ilana Glazer&apos;s not-quite-boyfriend, Lincoln&#x2014;and they&apos;ll call him by his character&apos;s name, and usually he&apos;s like, &quot;That&apos;s not my name. That&apos;s a character I play on TV.&quot; But he&apos;s softening. The next time it happens, &quot;I think I might just go, &#x2018;Hey, what&apos;s up?&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.8">When I tell Buress what the lackey kid said to me&#x2014;that his name isn&apos;t on the marquee because of the Cosby stuff&#x2014;he registers it with less annoyance than I expected. His face is a little inscrutable, the defining characteristic of his countenance being a not-typical-of-comics laconic chill, but he barely rolls his eyes at this.</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.9"><div class="callout large" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a520cbdab0df6312e27eed/master/w_925/hannibal-buress-gq-2015-04.jpg" alt="hannibal-buress-gq-2015-04.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhannibal-buress-bill-cosby-comedy-central&amp;t=hannibal-buress-gq-2015-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhannibal-buress-bill-cosby-comedy-central&amp;t=hannibal-buress-gq-2015-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhannibal-buress-bill-cosby-comedy-central&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a520cbdab0df6312e27eed%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhannibal-buress-gq-2015-04.jpg&amp;description=hannibal-buress-gq-2015-04.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhannibal-buress-bill-cosby-comedy-central&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a520cbdab0df6312e27eed%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhannibal-buress-gq-2015-04.jpg&amp;description=hannibal-buress-gq-2015-04.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.a">&quot;That&apos;s not why,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s because they&apos;re not paying me enough.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.b">If they want to put his name on the marquee, Buress tells me, he has to be headlining. Even if it&apos;s just for a secret show, the tickets need to cost what tickets to a Hannibal Buress show cost. He would have brought the DJ he travels with if this were a Hannibal Buress show. He might have hired some ballerinas, which is also a thing he does on occasion, but only when it&apos;s a Hannibal Buress show. Nah, this is just a quick set, in and out.</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.c">In the past year, Buress has gone from cult comic to mainstream star. He was already familiar to people who watch <em>Broad City</em> or <em>The Eric Andre Show,</em> which he&apos;s co-hosted for three years, or who listen to podcasts like Marc Maron&apos;s or <em>The Nerdist</em> or <em>The Joe Rogan Experience.</em> He&apos;d done time in the writers&apos; room on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> (&quot;It wasn&apos;t for me. I didn&apos;t apply myself as much as I could&apos;ve. Maybe I didn&apos;t enjoy the place that much&quot;) and <em>30 Rock</em> (&quot;<em>30 Rock</em> I enjoyed&#x2014;they&apos;d probably say nice things about me, but they won&apos;t say that I was a great sitcom writer&quot;). Then came the hour-long specials, and slowly the venues went from clubs to sold-out theaters. He went from don&apos;t-I-know-you-from-somewhere to oh-my-God-it&apos;s-Hannibal-Buress. Now he has his own show on Comedy Central, <em>Why? with Hannibal Buress,</em> a weekly variety show of sorts that incorporates man-on-the-street interviews, filmed segments, and bits of his stand-up.</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.d">This steady rise was already peaking last fall when some shaky footage surfaced online of a bit Buress had been doing for a few weeks, one in which he mentions that Bill Cosby has no real right to tell black people how to behave&#x2014;to pull up their pants and so forth&#x2014;because &quot;you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches.&quot; The shock of the line would always get a laugh, and in case anyone thought he was just joking, he would double down: &quot;When you leave here, Google &#x2018;Bill Cosby rape.&#x2019; That shit has more results than &#x2018;Hannibal Buress.&#x2019; &quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.e">Now, we&apos;d known, or at least kind of known, about Cosby. We&apos;d heard accusations. Yet somehow the world hadn&apos;t been ready to face the possibility that our own Dr. Huxtable&#x2014;do you remember that he played an obstetrician? a specialty in which one drugs women and handles their genitals, a big fuck-you to us all&#x2014;the man who made TV safe for middle-class black families, was raping women. But it was a different time now. Hannibal had shaken us awake. We were listening.</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.f">The clip was passed around by just about everyone with a Facebook account, and suddenly, a storm: CNN panels were convened night after night. More than forty women came forward to tell their frighteningly similar stories about how Cosby had allegedly drugged and assaulted them. State laws were changed to extend statutes of limitation from what they were when we&apos;d first ignored allegations that Cosby was a demented excuse for a human. CBS News posted a story called &quot;Who is Hannibal Buress, and why did he call Bill Cosby a &#x2018;rapist&#x2019;?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.g">And, says Buress, it halted Comedy Central&apos;s announcement of Hannibal&apos;s new TV show. The hope was to put a pin in the press release until the craziness died down, until Hannibal Buress&apos;s name was no longer associated with that sick fucker Bill Cosby&apos;s.</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.h">But that never happened&#x2014;at least, it still hasn&apos;t&#x2014;and so when the show was finally announced, Buress got tweets and e-mails that said things like, &quot;You fucking sold out Cosby and now you got a show.&quot; Because, reader, there are still people rooting for Bill Cosby. &quot;This deal closed, like, June of last year,&quot; Buress says. &quot;That person can&apos;t be argued with.&quot;</p><div class="embed iframe" data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.i"><div class="wrapper" data-type="iframe"><iframe src="http://player.cnevids.com/embed/55ad234861646d0c6e00000d/51097beb8ef9aff9f5000005" height="390" width="560"></iframe></div></div><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.j"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Hannibal Buress was</strong> on the debate team in high school in Chicago when he realized he could make people laugh. I tell you this in order to emphasize that congeniality maybe doesn&apos;t come so naturally to a guy whose main comedic jam is parsing things people say and do and then correcting them. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say I&apos;m combative,&quot; he says, &quot;but, like, when people say something that&apos;s wrong, I&apos;m one to correct them.&quot; Buress is like the smart-aleck kid brother who harps on your every error and hyperbolic moment, and who would be insufferable if he weren&apos;t incredibly funny. But as I said: He&apos;s learning, taking it one day at a time. (He hates that phrase, by the way, &quot;taking it one day at a time&quot;: &quot;You know who else is? Everybody. Cuz that&apos;s how time works. That&apos;s the only way you can take time.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.l">I&apos;d first met Buress at the production offices for <em>Why?</em> on the Paramount lot. He greeted me warmly, and when I sat down and pulled my tape recorder out, he pulled out his iPhone and hit record, too. &quot;Isn&apos;t this what Beyonc&#xE9; does?&quot; he asked me. His office is corporate, standard-issue Paramount, a used couch and a cheap desk and a wipeboard with ideas on it like &quot;Urban Elephant Joke Jam&quot; and &quot;Coffee Civil Rights.&quot;</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.m"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a410785f1c7af15a1f0dff/master/w_925/hannibal-buress-gq-2015-02.jpg" alt="hannibal-buress-gq-2015-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhannibal-buress-bill-cosby-comedy-central&amp;t=hannibal-buress-gq-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhannibal-buress-bill-cosby-comedy-central&amp;t=hannibal-buress-gq-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhannibal-buress-bill-cosby-comedy-central&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a410785f1c7af15a1f0dff%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhannibal-buress-gq-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=hannibal-buress-gq-2015-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhannibal-buress-bill-cosby-comedy-central&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a410785f1c7af15a1f0dff%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fhannibal-buress-gq-2015-02.jpg&amp;description=hannibal-buress-gq-2015-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div></div><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.n">He wore a large gold Orefici watch and a black Hundreds T-shirt, jeans, and gray ankle boots. His appearance has changed over the years. He&apos;s gotten Lasik, and also veneers&#x2014;his &quot;TV teeth,&quot; as he calls them&#x2014;to correct the gap in the front. He tells me he plans to slim down for the show because he&apos;s worried that he&apos;s gotten fat. I tell him he can do that because he&apos;s a man, just lose weight at a moment&apos;s notice, and he tells me, no, he can do it because he is capable of hard work.</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.o">I had been warned going in that Buress would shut down if I brought up the Cosby stuff. That&apos;s not true. It&apos;s that he&apos;ll shut down if you ask him stupid questions about the Cosby stuff. He&apos;ll talk about it when he can be funny. (At Justin Bieber&apos;s roast: &quot;I hate your music more than Bill Cosby hates my comedy.&quot;) And he&apos;ll talk about it when he&apos;s asked thoughtfully. (To Howard Stern: &quot;That wasn&apos;t my intention, to make it a part of a big discussion. It was just something I was doing at that venue right then.&quot;) But when he was doing a phone interview in March to promote a show in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and the reporter alluded to it in a way that Buress didn&apos;t like, he hung up on the guy. &quot;I don&apos;t want to talk about it with you&quot; is how he explained the incident to me, &quot;[because you&apos;re] being a dick.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.p">I asked him if he regretted that Cosby bit, and he said he didn&apos;t, because &quot;you can&apos;t predict shit like that.&quot; But I pressed him. Did he realize he was a feminist hero? I actually said that: &quot;You are a feminist hero,&quot; I told him, and meanwhile he smiled slightly and looked down and bobbed his head slowly like he was considering something. &quot;People are going to put on you whatever they want to put on you. It is conflicting, because people think I&apos;m like this amazing guy or something.&quot; He laughs. &quot;I&apos;m a decent guy.&quot; The thing is, though, he&apos;s not in comedy to be decent&#x2014;he&apos;s in it to be funny. And he&apos;s realizing how hard it is for people to think of you as funny when your name keeps showing up in sentences alongside the word <em>rape.</em></p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.q">He is too smart at this point to pontificate on Bill Cosby with a tape recorder running. He&apos;s done enough interviews to know that a quote you never give cannot be taken out of context. Still, the net result is the same: You open up your <em>GQ,</em> and the Hannibal Buress story is about Bill Cosby. I hope Buress will like it, but if he doesn&apos;t, I hope he&apos;ll understand. He brought something we&apos;d ignored to national attention. He helped begin the closure process for possibly dozens of victims. And he did all of it while being <em>funny.</em> What kind of comedian&apos;s estimation of himself does not leave room for a random monologue to change the world?</p><p data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.4.r">And yet, finally, despite his efforts to be nicer, to be more forgiving, to let go, he spreads his arms out wide and looks up at the ceiling and says not so much to me but to everyone, everywhere: &quot;I don&apos;t know what the fuck else you want me to say.&quot;</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".ukkzbgyp6o.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
