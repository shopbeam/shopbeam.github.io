It\u0027s always a gas to see unlikely heroes rise, to see the ordinary reflected back at us by athletes. But at bottom, the NBA is a league of stars. It\u0027s not just that their narratives are more outsized, their brands bigger, and their egos more thoroughly sated. In basketball, a supremely gifted individual can almost single-handedly swing the outcome of a game. The NBA\u0027s elite are empowered like no other professional athletes. And when you look at what they can accomplish on the court, why wouldn\u0027t they be?\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s what made Game Five of the Finals such a blast: Reigning MVP Stephen Curry and four-time winner LeBron James both showed up healthy, well-rested, and ready to square off for a title.\u000A\u000AThis was the showdown we\u0027d been hoping for all along. Curry hadn\u0027t quite been himself since taking a hard fall in the Western Conference Finals. James, for all the superhuman numbers he\u0027s been putting up, was obviously gassed, especially in Game Four. Last night both returned to form in truly epic fashion. Curry\u0027s uncanny shooting and sinuous ball skills were on full display. And LeBron, while still going out of his way to exploit mismatches in the paint, looked spry and energized. From an emotional standpoint, Game Two may have been a high watermark of his career. Statistically speaking, last night was probably the best game James has played in a series that\u0027s already become the stuff of legend.\u000A\u000AOf course, basketball is about the bottom line. The Warriors won, the Cavs lost, and Golden State is now one win away from a title. The Cavaliers proved that with LeBron at full strength, they could band together and put up an admirable fight against a Golden State team that was firing on all cylinders. But the Warriors are still the Warriors and that\u0027s why, even though the Cavs managed to stay close for much of the game, GSW finally pulled ahead and sealed the deal in the fourth.\u000A\u000AWinning a title is everything. But as a fan, getting to finally see Curry and James duke it out at full-strength was its own reward. The two couldn\u0027t be more different as players—Curry is all lightning guile and ingenuity, while present-day James is a master tactician whose sheer prowess remains unmatched—but what they have in common is that, as performers, they\u0027re absolutely riveting to watch when they\u0027re this on. You keep waiting for them to get their hands on the ball and when they do, there\u0027s a profound sense that something big is about to go down.\u000A\u000AOn possession after possession, Curry and James lived up to their reputations. Not just as guys who get results—LeBron\u0027s been doing that—but as reminders of why we started watching basketball in the first place.\u000A\u000AEvery series has its narratives. Coming out of Game Five, though, the storylines are almost contradictory or at least only tangentially related to wins and losses. If Curry and Golden State close the series out on Tuesday, they cap off an utterly remarkable series and possibly set a new template for how the game is played. And if the Cavs lose, James is still lionized as the best player in the league and his rag-tag teammates earn kudos for even being able to compete at this level. If the Cavs win in seven, James has pulled off the mother of all upsets and his gaudy stat lines transcend individual accomplishments. The Warriors will have run smack dab into the arguably the greatest player to ever play the game and learned that, no matter how deadly Curry is, a team with this LeBron James still has the basketball equivalent of a nuclear submarine.\u000A\u000AOf course, one could get crotchety and claim that with Curry and James both fully operational, the series is only now truly underway and the divide between winners and losers has never been more absolute. I can\u0027t help but feel, though, that when two guys are playing this well, there\u0027s something there that goes beyond the final score. If they\u0027re feeling it, the game is better for it and while there\u0027s going to be a final score, in the end we all sort of win.",

Statistically speaking, last night was probably the best game James has played in a series that&apos;s already become the stuff of legend.</p><p data-reactid=".r4tlpg3bb4.1.1.0.0.4.5">Of course, basketball is about the bottom line. The Warriors won, the Cavs lost, and Golden State is now one win away from a title. The Cavaliers proved that with LeBron at full strength, they could band together and put up an admirable fight against a Golden State team that was firing on all cylinders. But the Warriors are still the Warriors and that&apos;s why, even though the Cavs managed to stay close for much of the game, GSW finally pulled ahead and sealed the deal in the fourth.</p><p data-reactid=".r4tlpg3bb4.1.1.0.0.4.6">Winning a title is everything. But as a fan, getting to finally see Curry and James duke it out at full-strength was its own reward. The two couldn&apos;t be more different as players&#x2014;Curry is all lightning guile and ingenuity, while present-day James is a master tactician whose sheer prowess remains unmatched&#x2014;but what they have in common is that, as performers, they&apos;re absolutely riveting to watch when they&apos;re this on. You keep waiting for them to get their hands on the ball and when they do, there&apos;s a profound sense that something big is about to go down.</p><p data-reactid=".r4tlpg3bb4.1.1.0.0.4.7">On possession after possession, Curry and James lived up to their reputations. Not just as guys who get results&#x2014;LeBron&apos;s been doing that&#x2014;but as reminders of why we started watching basketball in the first place.</p><p data-reactid=".r4tlpg3bb4.1.1.0.0.4.8">Every series has its narratives. Coming out of Game Five, though, the storylines are almost contradictory or at least only tangentially related to wins and losses. If Curry and Golden State close the series out on Tuesday, they cap off an utterly remarkable series and possibly set a new template for how the game is played. And if the Cavs lose, James is still lionized as the best player in the league and his rag-tag teammates earn kudos for even being able to compete at this level. If the Cavs win in seven, James has pulled off the mother of all upsets and his gaudy stat lines transcend individual accomplishments. The Warriors will have run smack dab into the arguably the greatest player to ever play the game and learned that, no matter how deadly Curry is, a team with this LeBron James still has the basketball equivalent of a nuclear submarine.</p><p data-reactid=".r4tlpg3bb4.1.1.0.0.4.9">Of course, one could get crotchety and claim that with Curry and James both fully operational, the series is only now truly underway and the divide between winners and losers has never been more absolute. I can&apos;t help but feel, though, that when two guys are playing this well, there&apos;s something there that goes beyond the final score. If they&apos;re feeling it, the game is better for it and while there&apos;s going to be a final score, in the end we all sort of win.</p></div><div class="grid"
