  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A \u0022Thank you for this opportunity.\u0022\u000A\u000A DMX said this to me. We were speaking over the phone, the day before he was set to play a sold-out show at SOB\u0027s, a club in New York City\u0027s West Village that, with its high ceiling and enormous pillars, brought to mind a Roman temple bent inwards on itself. \u0022Thank you for this opportunity\u0022 could mean any number of things. It could be worthless, the kind of kernel thrown out with as much significance as a \u0022How are you\u0022 or a \u0022Fuck Drake.\u0022 It could\u0027ve been posturing; as X spoke, he spoke of God and gifts and whatever, sounding political as artists often do in interviews, when their desire to actually communicate runs up against the need to not say something stupid. (This is a problem X has encountered before.) He spoke in a machine-gun burst, chopping up his sentences into brief clusters—\u0022I... don\u0027thavetobe... workingonanalbum... torecordasong\u0022—and I never knew when something he said was pre-determined or when it was the byproduct of whatever the hell was going on in his head. Or—maybe—it could\u0027ve all been genuine.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Before he became Dark Man X, Dog Man X, the Dog, etc., Earl Simmons was a turntablist and beatbor. But that\u0027s a century ago. Still far removed is the time when DMX landed at #1 on the Billboard 200 with his debut album, It\u0027s Dark and Hell is Hot, an LP forged over the course of a decade spent getting shafted by labels, standing at the fence, watching the action, waiting for his chance.\u000A\u000A Once it came, X wasted no time. Dark begat Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood. Flesh gave way to And Then There Was X. Then The Great Depression, then Grand Champ. They all hit #1. Five Billboard toppers between 1998 and 2003, all fused into the DNA of any rap fan born between 1975 and 1990. There were movies, also, though that\u0027s a rabbit hole we don\u0027t want to tumble down—X told me that he didn\u0027t like movies as much because he spent all that time pretending to be another person; he\u0027d rather just be himself. There were troubles, too. His criminal record is long and multifarious, and his own oddity bled into the public consciousness in different ways over the last half-decade—which is also how long it\u0027s been since he\u0027s released an album. The wave of mutilation peaked with accusations of animal cruelty and a truly peculiar interview in 2008, during the presidential race, in which X claimed to have never heard of Barack Obama.\u000A\u000A Meanwhile, another rapper existed in a parallel universe. He cloaked himself in the word Jehova (which means God—Dog spelled backwards, you know). This rapper also had a #1 album in 1998, Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life. When it was nominated for a Grammy award, the rapper boycotted the ceremony in protest of the fact that his labelmate, X, had not been nominated. This rapper toured with X. They worked together with producer Swizz Beatz. About this rapper, a man by the name of Jay-Z, DMX wouldn\u0027t say much.\u000A\u000A \u0022He\u0027s just a different person. He\u0027s changed. I\u0027m still the same.\u0022\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A When I showed up at SOB\u0027s—a little more than two weeks after Jay-Z performed, buoyed by the glory of a full orchestra, in front of a $500-a-ticket house at Carnegie Hall and six weeks after his daughter, Blue Ivy, was born—a smaller band featuring a singer, rapper, and violinist played. It was confusing. The hall stank of weed, and nobody paid attention.\u000A\u000A After the band finished up, DJ Mary Mac held court, spinning a lot of, well, Jay-Z. \u0022Public Service Announcement\u0022 and \u0022Empire State of Mind\u0022 and \u0022Encore\u0022 and \u002299 Problems\u0022 and \u0022Niggas in Paris\u0022 and \u0022No Church in the Wild.\u0022 Other than Meek Mill\u0027s \u0022House Party\u0022 and \u0022I\u0027m a Boss,\u0022 the crowd remained stock-still through the set. Even as the sexy, strutting \u0022Shot Caller\u0022 by French Montana played, it sparked about as much dancing as a TED Talk. Jay looms large, even at a DMX concert.\u000A\u000A Forty-five minutes of that gave way to a preposterous, Korn-esque thrash band that featured a chubby white dude on bass rocking a David Foster Wallace bandana and a dreadlocked lead singer, Bazaar Royale, who alternated between lecturing the crowd on respect and delivering lyrics like, \u0022I see the sun rise when I look into your eyes.\u0022 They covered Kings of Leon\u0027s \u0022Use Somebody.\u0022 Not kidding.\u000A\u000A After that ended, the audience learned that X had not yet arrived. It was 11:15; he was scheduled to go on at 10, though set times at rap concerts are a malleable proposition. At nearly 11:30, we were told he arrived, and then something happened—the chants, the enthusiasm, the love. Like a support group, the crowd rallied to bring out a man who meant something to them, who, as those who paved the way for him kept putting it, they\u0027d grown up with.\u000A\u000A DMX is still ripped. It took maybe five songs for him to strip down to shorts and little else— sunglasses gone, plaid shirt gone, brown sweater gone. His torso is tattooed with words, little words. His back bears a dog. Holding forth in a semi-circle of associates, scowling men draped in Champion crewnecks who look like they never escaped the \u002790s, X raged and chopped the air apart. He moved with erratic force, never quite coming to rest—even when he stopped shadowboxing, he shook electrically, vibrating like a steam engine. \u0022Pugilistic\u0022 is the best word I can think of to describe his performance: he had no hype men, only a dozen onlookers surrounding him like kids bracketing a street fight.\u000A\u000A The songs came short and hard, lasting only a minute and a half or two minutes. Then Swizz Beatz hit the stage and they broke into \u0022Ruff Ryders\u0027 Anthem.\u0022 Mr. Alicia Keys produced many of X\u0027s early hits, and, looking like a goofy younger brother, he bounded around X, working effectively as hype man.\u000A\u000A Between the fragmented half-songs, X would monologue his raps a capella, exhorting like a televangelist, preaching an archaic sermon about the state of the game. His idea: actions speak louder than words, and if you have to use words, you might as well rap about your actions. Kill, don\u0027t get killed.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A X complained to me that you\u0027ve got to pay to get played on the radio now.\u000A\u000A \u0022I\u0027m still the same,\u0022 he says. \u0022That\u0027s why the fans love me. Because they need stability in the industry. It\u0027s not that it\u0027s changing, and it keeps getting better. It\u0027s changing for the worse right now. It\u0027s bullshit. They\u0027re saying things that don\u0027t make sense. It\u0027s like they\u0027re dumbing down the audience, you know? My fans need me. I need me.\u0022\u000A\u000A At SOB\u0027s, his fans needed something: Turn-of-the-millennium DMX, the nostalgia for a different hip-hop, nostalgia for nostalgia\u0027s sake. When we spoke, X said it wasn\u0027t that he\u0027d stopped making music over the last six years; it was that the labels didn\u0027t want to release it. Whether that\u0027s true or not isn\u0027t important; it\u0027s what X believes.\u000A\u000A The show also made very clear that he doesn\u0027t see himself as relevant to rap anymore. He gave a cursory performance of three newish tracks after the DJ basically begged him to play the single. He zipped through these songs quickly, looking, in stark contrast to the unbridled mania he poured into his older work, like a cat forced into a bath. He seemed to want to get back, back to hits like \u0022Slippin\u0027\u0022 and \u0022Party Up.\u0022\u000A\u000A It isn\u0027t the opportunity to rival Jay-Z again that interests X. That time has come and gone. Forced to rejoin an environment in which, if he were starting out, he said he never could\u0027ve succeeded, X would much rather bring us back to his time, the era he dominated and defined. The present is uncertain. The past hangs on the wall, like a diploma\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A At one point, DMX sort of started to lose control. Nearly naked, he barked constantly, chewing his breath, and growling. The way he uses his voice as a percussive tool, pounding away in a multi-octave flurry of sounds, can clearly be heard today in guys like Waka Flocka Flame and Rick Ross. Their noises are as significant as their verses—\u0022UNGH,\u0022 \u0022BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW.\u0022 But X\u0027s style is different, more representative of the turntablist he once was; he scratches with his voice, shredding the beat, letting it crack and get thick.\u000A\u000A The gaps between songs grew longer. Still monologuing frequently, he began interacting with the crowd, at one point letting a girl towel him down, pretending to orgasm. That was uncomfortable. She appeared to go at his crotch with the towel. His entourage stood around like dilapidated statues, and he drank from a bottle of what looked like Hennessy, saying, \u0022Sip, and pass\u0022 over and over. The first time he did this, it was amusing. The second time, about an hour deep into the show, it must\u0027ve taken ten minutes; he turned the sharing into a lecture on why you pour out the first sip, how you honor those who aren\u0027t here with that first sip. Then he let the bottle into the crowd and guided it along, insisting that it be drunk to the last drop.\u000A\u000A \u0022FLESH OF MY FLESH,\u0022 he\u0027d yell, and the crowd would call back, \u0022BLOOD OF MY BLOOD.\u0022 He basked in the noise. \u0022The dog never left!\u0022 he\u0027d say, and there were cheers, though we knew it wasn\u0027t true. Or rather, it was true, but it was true because he\u0027d never left the place he\u0027d been. We all came back for a visit.\u000A\u000A \u0022What\u0027s going on in the rap game these days?\u0022 he asked. \u0022All they do is talk about what they got. If you put it in my face... I\u0027m gonna take it from you.\u0022\u000A\u000A Between spurts of energy, he mumbled and ranted incomprehensibly. When someone yelled, \u0022Fuck Drake,\u0022 he made a half-hearted pass. If Drake were there, X said he\u0027d tell him, \u0022I love you!\u0022 But he wasn\u0027t, so, mumble-mumble.\u000A\u000A The show slowed. The bottle was finished. X looked more skeletal than anything else, his sweating bald head gleaming in the stage lights, his body taut and framed like articulated bones in a classroom. Then came \u0022Lord Give Me a Sign,\u0022 and he came alive again. He spoke about God in our interview, how God had given him every verse he\u0027d ever had, and his life has been a strange representation of God, but then again, so have us all been strange representations of thousands of strange gods, including and especially the ones that don\u0027t exist. We prayed, together, to whatever God was left, and then X hung his head and climbed down from the stage.",

We were speaking over the phone, the day before he was set to play a sold-out show at SOB&#x2019;s, a club in New York City&#x2019;s West Village that, with its high ceiling and enormous pillars, brought to mind a Roman temple bent inwards on itself. &quot;Thank you for this opportunity&quot; could mean any number of things. It could be worthless, the kind of kernel thrown out with as much significance as a &quot;How are you&quot; or a &quot;Fuck Drake.&quot; It could&#x2019;ve been posturing; as X spoke, he spoke of God and gifts and whatever, sounding political as artists often do in interviews, when their desire to actually communicate runs up against the need to not say something stupid. (This is a problem X has encountered before.) He spoke in a machine-gun burst, chopping up his sentences into brief clusters&#x2014;&quot;I... don&#x2019;thavetobe... workingonanalbum... torecordasong&quot;&#x2014;and I never knew when something he said was pre-determined or when it was the byproduct of whatever the hell was going on in his head. Or&#x2014;maybe&#x2014;it could&#x2019;ve all been genuine.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.3"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.5"> Before he became Dark Man X, Dog Man X, the Dog, etc., Earl Simmons was a turntablist and beatbor. But that&#x2019;s a century ago. Still far removed is the time when DMX landed at #1 on the Billboard 200 with his debut album, It&#x2019;s <em>Dark and Hell is Hot</em>, an LP forged over the course of a decade spent getting shafted by labels, standing at the fence, watching the action, waiting for his chance.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.6"> Once it came, X wasted no time. <em>Dark</em> begat <em>Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood</em>. <em>Flesh</em> gave way to <em>And Then There Was X</em>. Then <em>The Great Depression</em>, then <em>Grand Cham</em>p. They all hit #1. Five Billboard toppers between 1998 and 2003, all fused into the DNA of any rap fan born between 1975 and 1990. There were movies, also, though that&#x2019;s a rabbit hole we don&#x2019;t want to tumble down&#x2014;X told me that he didn&#x2019;t like movies as much because he spent all that time pretending to be another person; he&#x2019;d rather just be himself. There were troubles, too. His criminal record is long and multifarious, and his own oddity bled into the public consciousness in different ways over the last half-decade&#x2014;which is also how long it&#x2019;s been since he&#x2019;s released an album. The wave of mutilation peaked with accusations of animal cruelty and a truly peculiar interview in 2008, during the presidential race, in which X <a href="http://www.xxlmag.com/features/2008/03/dmx-here-i-am/">claimed to have never heard of Barack Obama</a>.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.7"> Meanwhile, another rapper existed in a parallel universe. He cloaked himself in the word Jehova (which means God&#x2014;Dog spelled backwards, you know). This rapper also had a #1 album in 1998, <em>Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life</em>. When it was nominated for a Grammy award, the rapper boycotted the ceremony in protest of the fact that his labelmate, X, had not been nominated. This rapper toured with X. They worked together with producer Swizz Beatz. About this rapper, a man by the name of Jay-Z, DMX wouldn&#x2019;t say much.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.8"> &quot;He&#x2019;s just a different person. He&#x2019;s changed. I&#x2019;m still the same.&quot;</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.9"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.a"> When I showed up at SOB&#x2019;s&#x2014;a little more than two weeks after <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201202/jay-z-carnegie-hall-concert-new-york">Jay-Z performed</a>, buoyed by the glory of a full orchestra, in front of a $500-a-ticket house at Carnegie Hall and six weeks after his daughter, Blue Ivy, was born&#x2014;a smaller band featuring a singer, rapper, and violinist played. It was confusing. The hall stank of weed, and nobody paid attention.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.b"> After the band finished up, DJ Mary Mac held court, spinning a lot of, well, Jay-Z. &quot;Public Service Announcement&quot; and &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot; and &quot;Encore&quot; and &quot;99 Problems&quot; and &quot;Niggas in Paris&quot; and &quot;No Church in the Wild.&quot; Other than Meek Mill&#x2019;s &quot;House Party&quot; and &quot;I&#x2019;m a Boss,&quot; the crowd remained stock-still through the set. Even as the sexy, strutting &quot;Shot Caller&quot; by French Montana played, it sparked about as much dancing as a TED Talk. Jay looms large, even at a DMX concert.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Forty-five minutes of that gave way to a preposterous, Korn-esque thrash band that featured a chubby white dude on bass rocking a David Foster Wallace bandana and a dreadlocked lead singer, Bazaar Royale, who alternated between lecturing the crowd on respect and delivering lyrics like, &quot;I see the sun rise when I look into your eyes.&quot; They covered Kings of Leon&#x2019;s &quot;Use Somebody.&quot; Not kidding.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.d"> After that ended, the audience learned that X had not yet arrived. It was 11:15; he was scheduled to go on at 10, though set times at rap concerts are a malleable proposition. At nearly 11:30, we were told he arrived, and then something happened&#x2014;the chants, the enthusiasm, the love. Like a support group, the crowd rallied to bring out a man who meant something to them, who, as those who paved the way for him kept putting it, they&#x2019;d grown up with.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.e"> DMX is still ripped. It took maybe five songs for him to strip down to shorts and little else&#x2014; sunglasses gone, plaid shirt gone, brown sweater gone. His torso is tattooed with words, little words. His back bears a dog. Holding forth in a semi-circle of associates, scowling men draped in Champion crewnecks who look like they never escaped the &#x2019;90s, X raged and chopped the air apart. He moved with erratic force, never quite coming to rest&#x2014;even when he stopped shadowboxing, he shook electrically, vibrating like a steam engine. &quot;Pugilistic&quot; is the best word I can think of to describe his performance: he had no hype men, only a dozen onlookers surrounding him like kids bracketing a street fight.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.f"> The songs came short and hard, lasting only a minute and a half or two minutes. Then Swizz Beatz hit the stage and they broke into &quot;Ruff Ryders&#x2019; Anthem.&quot; Mr. Alicia Keys produced many of X&#x2019;s early hits, and, looking like a goofy younger brother, he bounded around X, working effectively as hype man.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.g"> Between the fragmented half-songs, X would monologue his raps a capella, exhorting like a televangelist, preaching an archaic sermon about the state of the game. His idea: actions speak louder than words, and if you have to use words, you might as well rap about your actions. Kill, don&#x2019;t get killed.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.h"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.i"> X complained to me that you&#x2019;ve got to pay to get played on the radio now.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.j"> &quot;I&#x2019;m still the same,&quot; he says. &quot;That&#x2019;s why the fans love me. Because they need stability in the industry. It&#x2019;s not that it&#x2019;s changing, and it keeps getting better. It&#x2019;s changing for the worse right now. It&#x2019;s bullshit. They&#x2019;re saying things that don&#x2019;t make sense. It&#x2019;s like they&#x2019;re dumbing down the audience, you know? My fans need me. I need me.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.k"> At SOB&#x2019;s, his fans needed something: Turn-of-the-millennium DMX, the nostalgia for a different hip-hop, nostalgia for nostalgia&#x2019;s sake. When we spoke, X said it wasn&#x2019;t that he&#x2019;d stopped making music over the last six years; it was that the labels didn&#x2019;t want to release it. Whether that&#x2019;s true or not isn&#x2019;t important; it&#x2019;s what X believes.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.l"> The show also made very clear that he doesn&#x2019;t see himself as relevant to rap anymore. He gave a cursory performance of three newish tracks after the DJ basically begged him to play the single. He zipped through these songs quickly, looking, in stark contrast to the unbridled mania he poured into his older work, like a cat forced into a bath. He seemed to want to get back, back to hits like &quot;Slippin&#x2019;&quot; and &quot;Party Up.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.m"> It isn&#x2019;t the opportunity to rival Jay-Z again that interests X. That time has come and gone. Forced to rejoin an environment in which, if he were starting out, he said he never could&#x2019;ve succeeded, X would much rather bring us back to his time, the era he dominated and defined. The present is uncertain. The past hangs on the wall, like a diploma</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.n"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.o"> At one point, DMX sort of started to lose control. Nearly naked, he barked constantly, chewing his breath, and growling. The way he uses his voice as a percussive tool, pounding away in a multi-octave flurry of sounds, can clearly be heard today in guys like Waka Flocka Flame and Rick Ross. Their noises are as significant as their verses&#x2014;&quot;UNGH,&quot; &quot;BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW.&quot; But X&#x2019;s style is different, more representative of the turntablist he once was; he scratches with his voice, shredding the beat, letting it crack and get thick.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.p"> The gaps between songs grew longer. Still monologuing frequently, he began interacting with the crowd, at one point letting a girl towel him down, pretending to orgasm. That was uncomfortable. She appeared to go at his crotch with the towel. His entourage stood around like dilapidated statues, and he drank from a bottle of what looked like Hennessy, saying, &quot;Sip, and pass&quot; over and over. The first time he did this, it was amusing. The second time, about an hour deep into the show, it must&#x2019;ve taken ten minutes; he turned the sharing into a lecture on why you pour out the first sip, how you honor those who aren&#x2019;t here with that first sip. Then he let the bottle into the crowd and guided it along, insisting that it be drunk to the last drop.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.q"> &quot;FLESH OF MY FLESH,&quot; he&#x2019;d yell, and the crowd would call back, &quot;BLOOD OF MY BLOOD.&quot; He basked in the noise. &quot;The dog never left!&quot; he&#x2019;d say, and there were cheers, though we knew it wasn&#x2019;t true. Or rather, it was true, but it was true because he&#x2019;d never left the place he&#x2019;d been. We all came back for a visit.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.r"> &quot;What&#x2019;s going on in the rap game these days?&quot; he asked. &quot;All they do is talk about what they got. If you put it in my face... I&#x2019;m gonna take it from you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.s"> Between spurts of energy, he mumbled and ranted incomprehensibly. When someone yelled, &quot;Fuck Drake,&quot; he made a half-hearted pass. If Drake were there, X said he&#x2019;d tell him, &quot;I love you!&quot; But he wasn&#x2019;t, so, mumble-mumble.</p><p data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.4.t"> The show slowed. The bottle was finished. X looked more skeletal than anything else, his sweating bald head gleaming in the stage lights, his body taut and framed like articulated bones in a classroom. Then came &quot;Lord Give Me a Sign,&quot; and he came alive again. He spoke about God in our interview, how God had given him every verse he&#x2019;d ever had, and his life has been a strange representation of God, but then again, so have us all been strange representations of thousands of strange gods, including and especially the ones that don&#x2019;t exist. We prayed, together, to whatever God was left, and then X hung his head and climbed down from the stage.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".2byt2w4gb28.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
