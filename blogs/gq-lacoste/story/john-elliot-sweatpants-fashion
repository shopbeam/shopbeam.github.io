  	    "articleBody": "Less than 48 hours before his second-ever runway show, designer John Elliott is a little annoyed. He\u0027s spent the better part of the last hour bouncing energetically around his temporary studio, a minimally furnished loft on Lafayette Street in New York City, but right now he\u0027s preoccupied, as he usually is, with fabric. In this case, a handful of new garments aren\u0027t hanging the right way. A sweater\u0027s shoulder has caught on a hanger, and Elliott\u0027s concerned that it\u0027ll warp before showtime. A staffer is summoned, the shoulder is straightened out, and the kid-you-not \u0022custom pigtail\u0022 fabric is no longer under duress. Elliott kindly explains the pigtail: \u0022It\u0027s like bouclé, but a little more summer-appropriate.\u0022\u000A\u000AThis is the language of John Elliott. He speaks of fabric the way John Nash parsed mathematical equations, the way Peyton Manning sizes up defensive coverages. He utters phrases like \u0022high-density twisted yarn mixed with some sort of super loose yarn, where the face will be a silk blend but the back side will be a chunky loop.\u0022 It\u0027s impossible to follow, this savant-grade expertise. It\u0027s also what led this magazine to name him one of America\u0027s Best New Menswear Designers last year, and it\u0027s the real reason why his \u0022Villain\u0022 hoodie—the one that started the side-zipper movement, the one that\u0027s now ubiquitous in the fashion world—is so damn perfect. You\u0027re pulled in by the design, sure, but it\u0027s the French terry—a super-high-end version of the stuff every sweatshirt is made of, hardy but with a bit of give—that makes you wish you could wear it every day of the week.\u000A\u000APreparations for the show continue. Elliott\u0027s team (six guys, three women today) sport varying degrees of their boss\u0027s extremely-high-and-tight haircut. They\u0027re also dressed, nearly to a man, in heather-gray John Elliott tees and assorted shades of John Elliott denim. This is John Elliott one-point-oh: Layers of extra-long, notched-hem T-shirts, skinny jeans and sweatpants, the Villain at the fore. The clothes came along at just the right time. As work became a thing we do at all times, often from airport lounges and living room couches, sweatpants and tees became a sensible uniform. And for the discerning guy, baggy gym sweats and Knicks tees wouldn\u0027t do. Elliott stepped in to fill that void in guys\u0027 closets: try an extra-long tee, one that hangs loose and looks oddly perfect hanging from under a cropped jacket, and sweats that fit more like skinny jeans. A corporate trend forecaster would say that John Elliott + Co.\u0027s staples fit squarely into that category called, cringingly, \u0022athleisure.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut the Villain, the sweatpants, everything that came before today, are old news. John Elliott is moving beyond basics. His Spring 2016 collection is his most comprehensive yet, clocking in at just under 200 distinct pieces. Outerwear came in February, at his Fashion Week debut—where everything hewed, mostly, to the one-color future-sport look he\u0027s known for. But in two days, he\u0027ll send an ambitious evolution of that look down the runway in New York. The minimal, sleek shapes are gone. What\u0027s coming is more experimental and beat-up, borne out of a trip he took to Vietnam. The world wants Villains (and Elliott will gladly continue to sell them), but here in his studio, Elliott is obsessing over custom pigtail and translucent nylon, flatback thermal and a \u0022higher-density, super tightly woven poplin. And he\u0027s determined to drag his rabid, Internet-y fanbase into the weird with him. Mesh leggings! Translucent nylon jackets! Hell, baggy pants! Maybe it\u0027ll be a hit. Or maybe the fickle fashion world will decide that they like the old John Elliott stuff better. Just sweatshirts, please. Thanks for trying.  \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAs far as origin stories go, Elliott\u0027s might be up there with Nike founder Bill Bowerman and his waffle maker. The Villain wasn\u0027t expected to be the nascent line\u0027s hit when it launched in 2012, and neither were the New Age sweats. John Elliott + Co. started as a denim brand. Elliott, working in retail in San Francisco, collected A.P.C.\u0027s worn-in Butler jeans, and while starting up his own company, apprenticed with the denim designer Simon Miller. Jeans were supposed to be the thing. \u0022I engineered the denim,\u0022 Elliott laughs, a bit ruefully, \u0022and the shit didn\u0027t take off!\u0022 Both the hoodie and the sweatpants are made from French terry—a material Elliott bought only after realizing he needed to launch with more than just jeans and tees. The rest is his legend: San Francisco kid sees an old highlight of 49ers QB Joe Montana in a playoff game against Lawrence Taylor and the New York Giants. \u0022Taylor destroyed him,\u0022 Elliott remembers. \u0022It looked like he got hit by a truck. Montana picks himself up out of the muddy turf, and his helmet\u0027s crooked, and his jersey\u0027s completely untucked. He had one of those hand warmers, and his asymmetrical jersey went over the front of it. So he tried to be casual and put his hands underneath the jersey, inside the vents—and bang, the light went on for me. I think I have an idea here.\u0022 Elliott took a sweatshirt, stitched zippers into the side seams, and tucked a kangaroo pocket inside. \u0022Sure enough,\u0022 he says, \u0022It was a good idea.\u0022\u000A\u000AHe\u0027s not exaggerating—the Villain is the line\u0027s best-seller \u0022by far,\u0022 Elliott says, and it\u0027s had the dubious honor of being knocked off frequently. So why leave it behind? \u0022I mean, how many times can you beat up a sweat and a side-zip? I\u0027m so proud of those pieces, but I want to tell a new story.\u0022 The clothes we\u0027re looking at right now—patched and dusty military jackets, those windbreakers with a translucent outer skin—are as far as you can get from a sweat and a side-zip. \u0022The hope,\u0022 he says, \u0022is that on a couple of them, you hit another home run.\u0022\u000A\u000ABut how do you duplicate the circumstances—a mastery of technique, the gut-feeling purchase of an unsexy fabric, a fortuitous ESPN Classic highlight—that led to the Villain? How do you reverse-engineer a home run? \u0022I had this idea that Vietnam could be really interesting for a collection—not based on the war, more about the color palette,\u0022 he says. \u0022When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with all the Vietnam War movies: Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket. I went back, and there\u0027s so many scenes that, from a color palette perspective, could be a really interesting story to tell.\u0022 So he spent two weeks in Vietnam, went running through Ho Chih Minh and Hanoi, and gathered the ashy grays and muted blues of buildings subjected to pollution. Then he added them to a collection fleshed out with military references, from bomber jackets to M65s and cargo pants.\u000A\u000AIn hunting so determinedly for inspiration, it\u0027s possible that a little bit of tunnel vision sets in. The history of men\u0027s fashion is largely inseparable from military clothing, yes. But Elliott\u0027s colors-only use of Vietnam combined with a handful of Hollywood depictions of the inhumanity of the war feels perhaps a bit naïve. It\u0027s the same feeling that crops up when you learn that the inspiration for his T-shirts originally came from a stockpile of broken-down, overwashed shirts worn by inmates in California\u0027s prison system. It doesn\u0027t seem intentional, this privileged, context-free appropriation. And maybe he feels it\u0027s forgivable: Elliott\u0027s the first to admit that his clothes work because they\u0027re cool. That\u0027s the directive, from him and from the kids buying his sweatshirts: that this new collection be cool, in the strange, ineffable way that his greatest successes are. \u0022It\u0027s fashion,\u0022 Elliott had explained earlier. \u0022Part of being cool is just shutting the fuck up and letting the product speak for itself.\u0022 \u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AOne thing you notice on the ground at a Fashion Week is the way that clothing marks you as a member of a tribe. This happens during non-Fashion Weeks, too, of course. Teens in goth black, dads in limp khakis, off-duty Wall Street analysts in gingham. But at a Fashion Week, where you have the #menswear dudes in double-breasted socks, and the athleisure guys in running tights and Nikes, and the Rick Owens ninjas in how-did-they-afford-that Rick Owens, the lines are that much starker. The beguiling thing about Elliott\u0027s clothes is that they float between and maybe even above those divisions. They\u0027re anonymous and yet immediately recognizable, slouchy and still structured, unbranded but beloved by the box-logo-loving Supreme kids.\u000A\u000AThe tribes are all represented at Elliott\u0027s runway show, held on a hazy, drizzly Wednesday. The show has that marker of Fashion Week success: a gaggle of professional athletes sitting front row, ready to geek out over clothes the same way we do over their day jobs. The set hums to life, horizontal fluorescent yardsticks flickering in front of crumbling faux-brick. The house lights dim, a pulsating soundtrack kicks up, and the models start walking. It\u0027s a parade of army jackets and mesh-covered running tights, the blasted-out military stuff layered with futuristic sportswear. The questions—Can Elliott keep growing? What\u0027s up with this whole Vietnam thing? Has he hit another home run?—are answered before he emerges to take his bow. The show is a deafening success. It is, undeniably, a huge step forward. And it is, as John Elliott + Co needs to be, cool, in that post-future way he does so well. Whether all that pigtail will sell is yet to be determined, but nobody seems all that worried. On the runway, Amar\u0027e Stoudemire and Nick Young—guys who are the living embodiment of athleisure, who have the very most reason (and very best frames) to wear Elliott\u0027s clothes—are waiting patiently to dap up the designer in their matching Villain sweatshirts. It\u0027s a very cool moment.",

He&#x2019;s spent the better part of the last hour bouncing energetically around his temporary studio, a minimally furnished loft on Lafayette Street in New York City, but right now he&#x2019;s preoccupied, as he usually is, with fabric. In this case, a handful of new garments aren&#x2019;t hanging the right way. A sweater&apos;s shoulder has caught on a hanger, and Elliott&#x2019;s concerned that it&#x2019;ll warp before showtime. A staffer is summoned, the shoulder is straightened out, and the kid-you-not &#x201C;custom pigtail&#x201D; fabric is no longer under duress. Elliott kindly explains the pigtail: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s like boucl&#xE9;, but a little more summer-appropriate.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.4.1">This is the language of John Elliott. He speaks of fabric the way John Nash parsed mathematical equations, the way Peyton Manning sizes up defensive coverages. He utters phrases like &#x201C;high-density twisted yarn mixed with some sort of super loose yarn, where the face will be a silk blend but the back side will be a chunky loop.&#x201D; It&apos;s impossible to follow, this savant-grade expertise. It&#x2019;s also what led this magazine to name him one of America&#x2019;s Best New Menswear Designers last year, and it&apos;s the real reason why his &#x201C;Villain&#x201D; hoodie&#x2014;the one that started the side-zipper movement, the one that&apos;s now ubiquitous in the fashion world&#x2014;is so damn perfect. You&apos;re pulled in by the design, sure, but it&apos;s the French terry&#x2014;a super-high-end version of the stuff every sweatshirt is made of, hardy but with a bit of give&#x2014;that makes you wish you could wear it every day of the week.</p><p data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.4.2">Preparations for the show continue. Elliott&#x2019;s team (six guys, three women today) sport varying degrees of their boss&#x2019;s extremely-high-and-tight haircut. They&#x2019;re also dressed, nearly to a man, in heather-gray John Elliott tees and assorted shades of John Elliott denim. This is John Elliott one-point-oh: Layers of extra-long, notched-hem T-shirts, skinny jeans and sweatpants, the Villain at the fore. The clothes came along at just the right time. As work became a thing we do at all times, often from airport lounges and living room couches, sweatpants and tees became a sensible uniform. And for the discerning guy, baggy gym sweats and Knicks tees wouldn&#x2019;t do. Elliott stepped in to fill that void in guys&#x2019; closets: try an extra-long tee, one that hangs loose and looks oddly perfect hanging from under a cropped jacket, and sweats that fit more like skinny jeans. A corporate trend forecaster would say that John Elliott + Co.&apos;s staples fit squarely into that category called, cringingly, &#x201C;athleisure.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.4.3">But the Villain, the sweatpants, everything that came before today, are old news. John Elliott is moving beyond basics. His Spring 2016 collection is his most comprehensive yet, clocking in at just under 200 distinct pieces. Outerwear came in February, at his Fashion Week debut&#x2014;where everything hewed, mostly, to the one-color future-sport look he&#x2019;s known for. But in two days, he&#x2019;ll send an ambitious evolution of that look down the runway in New York. The minimal, sleek shapes are gone. What&#x2019;s coming is more experimental and beat-up, borne out of a trip he took to Vietnam. The world wants Villains (and Elliott will gladly continue to sell them), but here in his studio, Elliott is obsessing over custom pigtail and translucent nylon, flatback thermal and a &#x201C;higher-density, super tightly woven poplin. And he&#x2019;s determined to drag his rabid, Internet-y fanbase into the weird with him. Mesh leggings! Translucent nylon jackets! Hell, <em>baggy pants!</em> Maybe it&#x2019;ll be a hit. Or maybe the fickle fashion world will decide that they like the old John Elliott stuff better. Just sweatshirts, please. Thanks for trying.  </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.4.5"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a96526ae529ee176ccd00e/master/w_768/DSCF0506.jpg" alt="DSCF0506.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-elliot-sweatpants-fashion&amp;t=DSCF0506.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-elliot-sweatpants-fashion&amp;t=DSCF0506.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-elliot-sweatpants-fashion&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a96526ae529ee176ccd00e%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FDSCF0506.jpg&amp;description=DSCF0506.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-elliot-sweatpants-fashion&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a96526ae529ee176ccd00e%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FDSCF0506.jpg&amp;description=DSCF0506.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.4.6">As far as origin stories go, Elliott&#x2019;s might be up there with Nike founder Bill Bowerman and his waffle maker. The Villain wasn&#x2019;t expected to be the nascent line&#x2019;s hit when it launched in 2012, and neither were the New Age sweats. John Elliott + Co. started as a denim brand. Elliott, working in retail in San Francisco, collected A.P.C.&#x2019;s worn-in Butler jeans, and while starting up his own company, apprenticed with the denim designer Simon Miller. Jeans were supposed to be the thing. &#x201C;I engineered the denim,&#x201D; Elliott laughs, a bit ruefully, &#x201C;and the shit didn&#x2019;t take off!&#x201D; Both the hoodie and the sweatpants are made from French terry&#x2014;a material Elliott bought only after realizing he needed to launch with more than just jeans and tees. The rest is his legend: San Francisco kid sees an old highlight of 49ers QB Joe Montana in a playoff game against Lawrence Taylor and the New York Giants. &#x201C;Taylor destroyed him,&#x201D; Elliott remembers. &#x201C;It looked like he got hit by a truck. Montana picks himself up out of the muddy turf, and his helmet&#x2019;s crooked, and his jersey&#x2019;s completely untucked. He had one of those hand warmers, and his asymmetrical jersey went over the front of it. So he tried to be casual and put his hands underneath the jersey, inside the vents&#x2014;and <em>bang</em>, the light went on for me. <em>I think I have an idea here.</em>&#x201D; Elliott took a sweatshirt, stitched zippers into the side seams, and tucked a kangaroo pocket inside. &#x201C;Sure enough,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;It was a good idea.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.4.7">He&#x2019;s not exaggerating&#x2014;the Villain is the line&#x2019;s best-seller &#x201C;by far,&#x201D; Elliott says, and it&#x2019;s had the dubious honor of being knocked off frequently. So why leave it behind? &#x201C;I mean, how many times can you beat up a sweat and a side-zip? I&#x2019;m so proud of those pieces, but I want to tell a new story.&#x201D; The clothes we&#x2019;re looking at right now&#x2014;patched and dusty military jackets, those windbreakers with a translucent outer skin&#x2014;are as far as you can get from a sweat and a side-zip. &#x201C;The hope,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;is that on a couple of them, you hit another home run.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.4.8">But how do you duplicate the circumstances&#x2014;a mastery of technique, the gut-feeling purchase of an unsexy fabric, a fortuitous ESPN Classic highlight&#x2014;that led to the Villain? How do you reverse-engineer a home run? &#x201C;I had this idea that Vietnam could be really interesting for a collection&#x2014;not based on the war, more about the color palette,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with all the Vietnam War movies: <em>Platoon</em>, <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>. I went back, and there&#x2019;s so many scenes that, from a color palette perspective, could be a really interesting story to tell.&#x201D; So he spent two weeks in Vietnam, went running through Ho Chih Minh and Hanoi, and gathered the ashy grays and muted blues of buildings subjected to pollution. Then he added them to a collection fleshed out with military references, from bomber jackets to M65s and cargo pants.</p><p data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.4.9">In hunting so determinedly for inspiration, it&#x2019;s possible that a little bit of tunnel vision sets in. The history of men&#x2019;s fashion is largely inseparable from military clothing, yes. But Elliott&#x2019;s colors-only use of Vietnam combined with a handful of Hollywood depictions of the inhumanity of the war feels perhaps a bit na&#xEF;ve. It&apos;s the same feeling that crops up when you learn that the inspiration for his T-shirts originally came from a stockpile of broken-down, overwashed shirts worn by inmates in California&#x2019;s prison system. It doesn&#x2019;t seem intentional, this privileged, context-free appropriation. And maybe he feels it&#x2019;s forgivable: Elliott&#x2019;s the first to admit that his clothes work because they&#x2019;re <em>cool</em>. That&#x2019;s the directive, from him and from the kids buying his sweatshirts: that this new collection be cool, in the strange, ineffable way that his greatest successes are. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s fashion,&#x201D; Elliott had explained earlier. &#x201C;Part of being cool is just shutting the fuck up and letting the product speak for itself.&#x201D; </p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.4.a"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55a9652cae529ee176ccd012/master/w_768/DSCF0462.jpg" alt="DSCF0462.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-elliot-sweatpants-fashion&amp;t=DSCF0462.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-elliot-sweatpants-fashion&amp;t=DSCF0462.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-elliot-sweatpants-fashion&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a9652cae529ee176ccd012%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FDSCF0462.jpg&amp;description=DSCF0462.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fjohn-elliot-sweatpants-fashion&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55a9652cae529ee176ccd012%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2FDSCF0462.jpg&amp;description=DSCF0462.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.4.b">One thing you notice on the ground at a Fashion Week is the way that clothing marks you as a member of a tribe. This happens during non-Fashion Weeks, too, of course. Teens in goth black, dads in limp khakis, off-duty Wall Street analysts in gingham. But at a Fashion Week, where you have the #menswear dudes in double-breasted socks, and the athleisure guys in running tights and Nikes, and the Rick Owens ninjas in how-did-they-afford-that Rick Owens, the lines are that much starker. The beguiling thing about Elliott&#x2019;s clothes is that they float between and maybe even above those divisions. They&#x2019;re anonymous and yet immediately recognizable, slouchy and still structured, unbranded but beloved by the box-logo-loving Supreme kids.</p><p data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.4.c">The tribes are all represented at Elliott&#x2019;s runway show, held on a hazy, drizzly Wednesday. The show has that marker of Fashion Week success: a gaggle of professional athletes sitting front row, ready to geek out over clothes the same way we do over their day jobs. The set hums to life, horizontal fluorescent yardsticks flickering in front of crumbling faux-brick. The house lights dim, a pulsating soundtrack kicks up, and the models start walking. It&#x2019;s a parade of army jackets and mesh-covered running tights, the blasted-out military stuff layered with futuristic sportswear. The questions&#x2014;<em>Can Elliott keep growing? What&#x2019;s up with this whole Vietnam thing? Has he hit another home run?</em>&#x2014;are answered before he emerges to take his bow. The show is a deafening success. It is, undeniably, a huge step forward. And it is, as John Elliott + Co needs to be, <em>cool</em>, in that post-future way he does so well. Whether all that pigtail will sell is yet to be determined, but nobody seems all that worried. On the runway, Amar&#x2019;e Stoudemire and Nick Young&#x2014;guys who are the living embodiment of athleisure, who have the very most reason (and very best frames) to wear Elliott&#x2019;s clothes&#x2014;are waiting patiently to dap up the designer in their matching Villain sweatshirts. It&#x2019;s a very cool moment.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".13pmpepr18g.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
