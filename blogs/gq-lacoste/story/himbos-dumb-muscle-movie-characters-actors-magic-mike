  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ARemember bimbos? Those well-endowed ladies with bra-size IQs who were always hanging in the background of movies and shows, offering low-level titillation and the occasional blonde-moment punch line? Finally, after years and years and years, the bimbo has clacked her heels into passé, become an inexcusable cliché, really—on par with the sassy black friend, both in tiredness and social incorrectness. These days, where there was once a gum-smacking blonde, there\u0027s now a hollow-headed dude. A hollow-headed dude with distinctly un-hollow pecs that look like they get buffed and detailed more regularly than a showroom Lamborghini. The kind of guy who has a misspelled Sanskrit character tattooed across his neck. A guy who immediately conjures the phrase man meat. A himbo, in other words.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AA definition for the OED: A himbo is a man who is more attractive than he is smart. A bimbo with nuts, to put it testicularly. Behold this Y-chromo parade of stupid: There\u0027s Schmidt, the ditzy kimono-wearing roommate on New Girl, who takes off his shirt whenever he\u0027s in the presence of an attractive female. Or Bobby, Courteney Cox\u0027s hunky ex-husband on Cougar Town, who says things like \u0022I don\u0027t get this time-zone crap. How can it be one time here and then another time at home?\u0022 Andy \u0022If you rearrange the letters of Peru, you could spell Europe!\u0022 Dwyer on Parks and Recreation? Total lumberjack himbo. There\u0027s James Marsden as Liz Lemon\u0027s latest boyfriend on 30 Rock, an aspiring hot-dog-stand owner who spells his name wrong and proudly carries a Sunglass Hut credit card. Actually, Liz Lemon is pretty much a himbo aficionado. Recall the season she spent with the beautiful, pea-brained Jon Hamm, who once screamed, \u0022This racket is a fart!\u0022 after losing a tennis game. (But he was still treated like royalty by all of humanity, thanks to the way sunlight reflected off his perfectly contoured cheekbones.) The smartest female character on TV dates like a double-X Hugh Hefner.\u000A\u000AIn part, the rise of the himbo has to do with the fact that beefcakedom has gone mainstream. This spring, Hollywood tried to sell a movie entirely on Taylor Kitsch in a loincloth, in the hopes that ladies who wanted to bed Tim Riggins would go to a space epic. John Carter is the sort of flick that once would have been marketed only to horny 12-year-old boys, except John Carter would have been wearing pants and the Martian princess would have been the half-naked sex object splashed across every ad. Next up is Magic Mike, a Steven Soderbergh movie about a male stripper, played by former exotic dancer and current big handsome doof Channing Tatum. He\u0027s joined in the art of pelvic gyration by Matthew McConaughey, who must have an insurance policy on his nipples, they\u0027ve been subjected to so much ocean wind. No one ever watched Showgirls for the moving story of one woman\u0027s struggle to rise to the top of her profession. Likewise, the primary attraction of Magic Mike is not its complex story lines or great acting. It is about seeing hot, chiseled bodies fairly naked. Hot, chiseled male bodies. Point being: You can now pen a movie around a guy\u0027s buns.\u000A\u000AOnce upon a just ten years ago, men were the last frontier against gender-equal shallowness. Sure, there were marginalized instances of himbodom. Like, say, the Chippendales, those waxy chests for hire. And on an early Seinfeld episode, even, Jerry pegs Elaine\u0027s jock boyfriend a \u0022mimbo.\u0022 (She breaks up with him after his face is wrecked in a rock-climbing accident.) In the late \u002790s, there was Friends\u0027 Joey, the heavily hair-gelled counterdolt to hippie ditz Phoebe, who would argue that the hair dig I just made was a \u0022moo point.\u0022 It\u0027s not like idiots only recently became amusing. But none of them were quite as blatantly objectified as today\u0027s himbos. We\u0027ve been building toward this moment, and now we\u0027ve fully embraced the existence of the insipid-on-the-inside, bronzed-on-the-outside male sex object. Turning on the TV these days is kinda like being at a bachelorette party. Never have the lusting-for and laughing-at impulses blended so seamlessly.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not a coincidence, either, that the Golden Age of Himbodom overlaps with the Year of the Lady. (Which it is, at least entertainmentwise.) Women are doing their own buddy comedies, like Bridesmaids, and there\u0027s been a wave of female-fronted shows. The most lauded formula on TV: pretty ladies + vulgar mouths. Even on the old-fogy networks, you\u0027ll hear a member of the so-called fairer sex spouting lines like \u0022This is giving me lady wood\u0022 or \u0022What\u0027d you do, shine a bat symbol on your vagina?\u0022 Hollywood has signed on to the idea of ladies as the crass sexual aggressors, and our pretty, vulgar leading ladies need subjects to crassly sexually aggress. Which means there\u0027s no need for the male co-star to be anything more than a handsome, unselfaware dolt. Brains, after all, aren\u0027t what inspires \u0022lady wood.\u0022\u000A\u000AThe himbo feels almost radical in an it\u0027s about time men were relegated to airhead status way. Now dudes are simply the shiny backboards off which female stars can bounce their punch lines. In a Liz Lemon relationship, there\u0027s no question who wears the (albeit marinara-sauce-encrusted) pants. And female shows like 2 Broke Girls, Whitney, and Are You There, Chelsea? might as well be titled Look Who\u0027s Sexist Now! It\u0027s progress! If revenge can be a kind of progress.\u000A\u000ABut here\u0027s where the revenge fantasy goes astray: There\u0027s something undeniably self-serving about the lot of the himbo. Unlike bimbos, they essentially get to play dumb, or just be dumb, without suffering any real consequences. Actresses who played big-bosomed airheads were tagged as big-bosomed airheads in real life—but no one considers Jon Hamm a dummy, even though he plays one in everything outside of Mad Men. (See: Bridesmaids, 30 Rock, SNL.) Male actors earn a sort of cultural cachet by going himbo. They get the audience\u0027s respect for it—it shows they don\u0027t take themselves too seriously. While also showing off their nicely toned pecs.\u000A\u000AIt might just be that this whole new class of dirty-talking, male-objectifying, role-reversing ladies aren\u0027t so much evening the score as making it easier for dudes to get laid by doing less. After all, in this scenario, it\u0027s women who are doing all the heavy luring, no effort necessary on the dude\u0027s part. Maybe you can see how this would be appealing. The seldom-clothed men of Jersey Shore—and keep in mind one of them is named after his abdominal musculature—spend their days gym-ing, tanning, and laundry-ing, and at night head to the dance floor, hold up their shirts, and simply wait for hordes of girls to claw their way over.\u000A\u000AThe bimbo is forever a curse to women, but the himbo ends up being a male fantasy: You can be an idiot, renounce any obligation to string a decent sentence together or even be a decent person, and still have lots and lots and lots of sex. Sex that comes to you as easily as pizza delivery. With women who want to use you as a sex object. If that\u0027s the blue pill, what man wouldn\u0027t take it?\u000A\u000ALauren Bans is a GQ associate editor",

Those well-endowed ladies with bra-size IQs who were always hanging in the background of movies and shows, offering low-level titillation and the occasional blonde-moment punch line? Finally, after years and years and years, the bimbo has clacked her heels into pass&#xE9;, become an inexcusable clich&#xE9;, really&#x2014;on par with the sassy black friend, both in tiredness and social incorrectness. These days, where there was once a gum-smacking blonde, there&#x2019;s now a hollow-headed dude. A hollow-headed dude with distinctly un-hollow pecs that look like they get buffed and detailed more regularly than a showroom Lamborghini. The kind of guy who has a misspelled Sanskrit character tattooed across his neck. A guy who immediately conjures the phrase <em>man meat</em>. A himbo, in other words.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".u1sr9baps0.1.1.0.0.4.2"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582d2691177d66d68d5a90d/master/w_806/entertainment-2012-05-himbos-himbos-see-slideshow.jpg" alt="entertainment-2012-05-himbos-himbos-see-slideshow.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhimbos-dumb-muscle-movie-characters-actors-magic-mike&amp;t=entertainment-2012-05-himbos-himbos-see-slideshow.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhimbos-dumb-muscle-movie-characters-actors-magic-mike&amp;t=entertainment-2012-05-himbos-himbos-see-slideshow.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhimbos-dumb-muscle-movie-characters-actors-magic-mike&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d2691177d66d68d5a90d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2012-05-himbos-himbos-see-slideshow.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2012-05-himbos-himbos-see-slideshow.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fhimbos-dumb-muscle-movie-characters-actors-magic-mike&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582d2691177d66d68d5a90d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fentertainment-2012-05-himbos-himbos-see-slideshow.jpg&amp;description=entertainment-2012-05-himbos-himbos-see-slideshow.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".u1sr9baps0.1.1.0.0.4.3">A definition for the <em>OED</em>: A himbo is a man who is more attractive than he is smart. A bimbo with nuts, to put it testicularly. Behold this Y-chromo parade of stupid: There&#x2019;s Schmidt, the ditzy kimono-wearing roommate on<em> New Girl</em>, who takes off his shirt whenever he&#x2019;s in the presence of an attractive female. Or Bobby, Courteney Cox&#x2019;s hunky ex-husband on<em> Cougar Town</em>, who says things like &quot;I don&#x2019;t get this time-zone crap. How can it be one time here and then another time at home?&quot; Andy &quot;If you rearrange the letters of Peru, you could spell Europe!&quot; Dwyer on <em>Parks and Recreation</em>? Total lumberjack himbo. There&#x2019;s James Marsden as Liz Lemon&#x2019;s latest boyfriend on <em>30 Rock</em>, an aspiring hot-dog-stand owner who spells his name wrong and proudly carries a Sunglass Hut credit card. Actually, Liz Lemon is pretty much a himbo aficionado. Recall the season she spent with the beautiful, pea-brained Jon Hamm, who once screamed, &quot;This racket is a fart!&quot; after losing a tennis game. (But he was still treated like royalty by all of humanity, thanks to the way sunlight reflected off his perfectly contoured cheekbones.) The smartest female character on TV dates like a double-X Hugh Hefner.</p><p data-reactid=".u1sr9baps0.1.1.0.0.4.5">In part, the rise of the himbo has to do with the fact that beefcakedom has gone mainstream. This spring, Hollywood tried to sell a movie entirely on Taylor Kitsch in a loincloth, in the hopes that ladies who wanted to bed Tim Riggins would go to a space epic. <em>John Carter</em> is the sort of flick that once would have been marketed only to horny 12-year-old boys, except John Carter would have been wearing pants and the Martian princess would have been the half-naked sex object splashed across every ad. Next up is <em>Magic Mike</em>, a Steven Soderbergh movie about a male stripper, played by former exotic dancer and current big handsome doof Channing Tatum. He&#x2019;s joined in the art of pelvic gyration by Matthew McConaughey, who must have an insurance policy on his nipples, they&#x2019;ve been subjected to so much ocean wind. No one ever watched <em>Showgirls</em> for the moving story of one woman&#x2019;s struggle to rise to the top of her profession. Likewise, the primary attraction of <em>Magic Mike</em> is not its complex story lines or great acting. It is about seeing hot, chiseled bodies fairly naked. Hot, chiseled male bodies. Point being: You can now pen a movie around a guy&#x2019;s buns.</p><p data-reactid=".u1sr9baps0.1.1.0.0.4.6">Once upon a just ten years ago, men were the last frontier against gender-equal shallowness. Sure, there were marginalized instances of himbodom. Like, say, the Chippendales, those waxy chests for hire. And on an early <em>Seinfeld</em> episode, even, Jerry pegs Elaine&#x2019;s jock boyfriend a &quot;mimbo.&quot; (She breaks up with him after his face is wrecked in a rock-climbing accident.) In the late &#x2019;90s, there was<em> Friends</em>&#x2019; Joey, the heavily hair-gelled counterdolt to hippie ditz Phoebe, who would argue that the hair dig I just made was a &quot;moo point.&quot; It&#x2019;s not like idiots only recently became amusing. But none of them were quite as blatantly objectified as today&#x2019;s himbos. We&#x2019;ve been building toward this moment, and now we&#x2019;ve fully embraced the existence of the insipid-on-the-inside, bronzed-on-the-outside male sex object. Turning on the TV these days is kinda like being at a bachelorette party. Never have the lusting-for and laughing-at impulses blended so seamlessly.</p><p data-reactid=".u1sr9baps0.1.1.0.0.4.7">It&#x2019;s not a coincidence, either, that the Golden Age of Himbodom overlaps with the Year of the Lady. (Which it is, at least entertainmentwise.) Women are doing their own buddy comedies, like <em>Bridesmaids</em>, and there&#x2019;s been a wave of female-fronted shows. The most lauded formula on TV: pretty ladies + vulgar mouths. Even on the old-fogy networks, you&#x2019;ll hear a member of the so-called fairer sex spouting lines like &quot;This is giving me lady wood&quot; or &quot;What&#x2019;d you do, shine a bat symbol on your vagina?&quot; Hollywood has signed on to the idea of ladies as the crass sexual aggressors, and our pretty, vulgar leading ladies need subjects to crassly sexually aggress. Which means there&#x2019;s no need for the male co-star to be anything more than a handsome, unselfaware dolt. Brains, after all, aren&#x2019;t what inspires &quot;lady wood.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".u1sr9baps0.1.1.0.0.4.8">The himbo feels almost radical in an <em>it&#x2019;s about time men were relegated to airhead status </em>way<em>.</em> Now dudes are simply the shiny backboards off which female stars can bounce their punch lines. In a Liz Lemon relationship, there&#x2019;s no question who wears the (albeit marinara-sauce-encrusted) pants. And female shows like<em> 2 Broke Girls</em>, <em>Whitney</em>, and <em>Are You There, Chelsea?</em> might as well be titled <em>Look Who&#x2019;s Sexist Now!</em> It&#x2019;s progress! If revenge can be a kind of progress.</p><p data-reactid=".u1sr9baps0.1.1.0.0.4.9">But here&#x2019;s where the revenge fantasy goes astray: There&#x2019;s something undeniably self-serving about the lot of the himbo. Unlike bimbos, they essentially get to play dumb, or just be dumb, without suffering any real consequences. Actresses who played big-bosomed airheads were tagged as big-bosomed airheads in real life&#x2014;but no one considers Jon Hamm a dummy, even though he plays one in everything outside of<em> Mad Men</em>. (See: <em>Bridesmaids</em>, <em>30 Rock</em>, <em>SNL</em>.) Male actors earn a sort of cultural cachet by going himbo. They get the audience&#x2019;s respect for it&#x2014;it shows they don&#x2019;t take themselves too seriously. While also showing off their nicely toned pecs.</p><p data-reactid=".u1sr9baps0.1.1.0.0.4.a">It might just be that this whole new class of dirty-talking, male-objectifying, role-reversing ladies aren&#x2019;t so much evening the score as making it easier for dudes to get laid by doing less. After all, in this scenario, it&#x2019;s women who are doing all the heavy luring, no effort necessary on the dude&#x2019;s part. Maybe you can see how this would be appealing. The seldom-clothed men of<em> Jersey Shore</em>&#x2014;and keep in mind one of them is named after his abdominal musculature&#x2014;spend their days gym-ing, tanning, and laundry-ing, and at night head to the dance floor, hold up their shirts, and simply wait for hordes of girls to claw their way over.</p><p data-reactid=".u1sr9baps0.1.1.0.0.4.b">The bimbo is forever a curse to women, but the himbo ends up being a male fantasy: You can be an idiot, renounce any obligation to string a decent sentence together or even be a decent person, and still have lots and lots and lots of sex. Sex that comes to you as easily as pizza delivery. With women who want to use you as a sex object. If that&#x2019;s the blue pill, what man wouldn&#x2019;t take it?</p><p data-reactid=".u1sr9baps0.1.1.0.0.4.c"><em>Lauren Bans is a </em>GQ <em>associate editor</em></p></div><div class="grid"
