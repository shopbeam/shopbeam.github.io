  	    "articleBody": "Everybody has that one friend who can just flat-out eat, hoovering up anything that gets put in front of him or her. Well, if the world were one giant friend group (and wouldn\u0027t that be nice?), then Joey Chestnut would be that guy. You know that contest on July 4th out on Coney Island where men and women shove Nathan\u0027s hot dogs into their mouths at lightning speed, and look like they want to vomit, and it makes you kind of want to vomit too, but you can\u0027t stop watching anyway? Well, Joey has won eight of those in a row, and it\u0027s never even close. \u000A\u000AHe\u0027s going for a ninth straight win on Saturday, and trying to break the elusive 70-hot-dogs-in-10-minutes barrier. He set the world record of 69 in 2013, to go along with his deep-fried asparagus record (12.8 lbs in 10 minutes), his Matzoh ball record (78 in eight), his hard boiled eggs record (141 in eight), and many others that are no less impressive/upchuck-inducing. Because it\u0027s Independence weekend and nothing\u0027s more red, white, and blue than mass consumption—especially of hot dogs—we caught up with Joey on Wednesday. While he said he couldn\u0027t talk about the rumored future one-on-one showdown with the other hot dog-eating legend Takeru Kobayashi, he did tell us about eating cow brain tacos, gastrointestinal distress, and competitive-eating groupies.   \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AWhat exactly does practice consist of for you?My last one, it\u0027s really light. It\u0027s just wanting to get into a rhythm. So I only eat about 30 hot dogs, and lots of water to help digest. Then I\u0027ll be fasting all the way up to 4th of July.\u000A\u000AWhat are some of the weirder foods you\u0027ve had to wolf down?I did kimchi when I was in Korea. That\u0027s not that weird. I also did cow brain tacos. I guess that was the weirdest thing I\u0027ve ever eaten.\u000A\u000AWhere was that?It was at a zombie pub-crawl in Minneapolis. \u000A\u000AAnd how many cow brain tacos did you eat?I think it was 54.\u000A\u000AIn how many minutes?Eight minutes. It was very fast. I was moving.\u000A\u000ACan you even taste it at that speed?I could taste it. They actually tasted pretty good.  They did a good job cooking them. [laughs] It was kind of like a really, really soft pork. The only weird part was it had a little bit of a metallic taste. It was kind of fatty and it wasn\u0027t bad. \u000A\u000ADo you have memories from childhood of just plowing through certain foods?My mom\u0027s cooking. She would make a ton of pasta and I would just eat so much of her pasta when I got home on Friday. And then we would go out to eat. There\u0027s an awesome burger place not far from my house. So I\u0027d go and get burgers and pie with my little brother.\u000A\u000AAfter the pasta?Yeah. He was impressed. [laughs]\u000A\u000AWhat do your parents think of all this now?I\u0027m lucky. My parents are like super hippies. They were just happy I was going to school and I wasn\u0027t getting in trouble. I don\u0027t know how I turned out normal. I could have gotten into real trouble. I was able to get a civil engineering degree and travel around the world and eat.\u000A\u000AWhat about Thanksgiving? Do you take down the whole spread?My parents would be pissed at me if I ate a ton of food at Thanksgiving. They\u0027d think I\u0027m an asshole. They don\u0027t want me to eat my favorite food. Cause I\u0027m picky. I would eat all the good dark meat, and eat all the good mashed potatoes.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s the conversation like when you go for the annual checkup?Well some doctors are very close-minded. They\u0027re like, \u0022Oh, it\u0027s really unhealthy,\u0022 and this and that. Well, alright, I know it\u0027s not healthy. Running marathons isn\u0027t healthy. The doctor I have now does my bloodwork. He talks about how I\u0027m feeling and he\u0027s really happy with the way my body\u0027s working. Towards the end of the summer I actually put on a little weight and every year, I end up trying to lose it. Sometimes I gain a little bit too much weight. \u000A\u000ABecause you\u0027re training?When I\u0027m training, I\u0027m on a really, really strict diet. But during summer, I\u0027ll do a practice contest on a Wednesday; then Saturday I\u0027ll do an eating contest; Saturday night, I\u0027ll go out with all the eaters and people of whatever city I\u0027m in, and just drinking, partying on Saturday night—doing that once a week really puts it on.\u000A\u000AWhen you go out after competitions with other eaters, do you guys eat?Not usually. It depends on the food [in the competition]. If it\u0027s like chicken wings, where I only did like four pounds of meat, oh yeah, you know I\u0027m going to be eating.\u000A\u000AFour pounds of meat isn\u0027t enough?I go into these contests really empty. So it\u0027s going to move through my stomach into my intestines really quickly. \u000A\u000AAnd what are you drinking after that? Just beer?I like my Jameson. You got to get something that\u0027s going to penetrate after all that food. [laughs] Beer will just sit on it.\u000A\u000AWhen you said you\u0027re on a strict diet, what does that diet consist of?   It\u0027s hot dogs, protein supplements, water. After every practice, I can feel when I\u0027m pretty much digested. And during that time, I\u0027m just taking protein supplements. And then I\u0027m drinking tons of lemon water, pretty much just do a cleanse. I want to get everything through my body… Even though I\u0027m digesting a MASSIVE amount of food, I\u0027ll actually lose weight while I\u0027m doing that.\u000A\u000AReally? So in that training process you lose weight?I kind of modeled it after a diet where one out of every five days is a binge day, which is pretty much what I\u0027m doing. And the other days are fasting. The eating or the practice, it speeds up my metabolism. And once I\u0027m not eating, my metabolism is still moving pretty good and I\u0027m not eating any food, hardly. So it actually helps me lose weight during a cycle.\u000A\u000AHow many pounds do you usually lose?This year, I\u0027ll only lost about 20. A little more than 20.\u000A\u000AHow many hot dogs would you estimate you eat over those four weeks?Oh my god. It fluctuates because sometimes my practices aren\u0027t necessarily capacity. I\u0027ll do 35 dogs and a lot of water. Other practices I\u0027ll do absolute capacity, where it\u0027s 70 hot dogs. Usually about two practices a week. Every fourth day.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s 420 hot dogs. Yeah. At least 420. I\u0027ve bought more than that actually.\u000A\u000ASo do you just go to the grocery store and buy mass quantities?They don\u0027t sell the Nathan\u0027s hot dogs hardly anywhere in the West Coast. So I have to special order them, and I just end up getting Nathan\u0027s to ship them to me.\u000A\u000AHow many do you have them ship?I have them ship by the thousand. I definitely ate more than [420]. I guess I\u0027ve been training a little bit longer this year.\u000A\u000AIs there any sort of athletic component to it at all?I think the whole practice and recovery, it\u0027s similar to marathon runners when they\u0027re slowly ramping up, they hit it and hit it again. Or even power lifters, who once they hit it, when they get the weight, they can go up a little bit more every time. They hit the muscle group, and they let it recover, they hit it again. \u000A\u000AAnd is there anything you can do to train your eating muscles, whatever those are?Yeah, I do tons of little things. Every morning when I\u0027m training, I wake up and first thing I do is I drink a gallon of water, [and] usually count how many gulps it takes. Usually I can do it in about 12 gulps. \u000A\u000AI imagine pitchers of beer go down pretty easy. Pitchers? Yeah. People can still down a pint faster than me, but usually a pitcher, I can beat ‘em. If not the first pitcher, definitely the second.\u000A\u000ASo this weekend how much will you gain over the course of the competition?In some of my practice, I\u0027ve gained 26 pounds. That\u0027s food, hot dog buns, and a lot of water. The next day I\u0027ll probably still have about 15 pounds. And then the next day it\u0027ll be down to about 4 pounds. So it stays but your body works it off one way or another.\u000A\u000AHow many calories is that 26 pounds of hot dogs,That\u0027ll be about 70 hot dogs. So that\u0027s almost 20,000 I think.\u000A\u000AWhat are the ten minutes immediately after the contest like? The first minute\u0027s the worst. Before the food settles, where you\u0027re feeling like, oh my god, where every burp feels like you might have an accident, like you might be disqualified. Then the burps settle and then I have to do a bunch of interviews. I\u0027m pretty much drunk on hot dogs. I feel like there\u0027s something wrong with me. All my answers are goofy.\u000A\u000ASo when you finish, are you still hungry? That\u0027s probably the only thing that has really changed about me is my feeling of hunger—and full. Like I don\u0027t really get hungry that much. Sometimes I get cravings for certain foods. But I can go all day without eating. \u000A\u000AAnd you don\u0027t really feel full either?Yeah, once I start eating, if there\u0027s food I like, I\u0027ll keep eating just because I love the taste. I just try to follow what other people are doing at the table. \u000A\u000ASo what happens after you get back to your hotel?I sleep, I drink liquid, run to the bathroom. Nature\u0027s gonna call.\u000A\u000AHow many times does that happen in the 24 hours after?Oh my god. [laughs] It happens... [long pause] I\u0027d say I\u0027m happy if it happens less than eight times. It could be around 10 times. It\u0027s weird the way the body works. The human body\u0027s amazing. \u000A\u000ACan you die from doing this?My doctor, he didn\u0027t seem at all worried about anything like that. I was like, \u0022What about the stomach rupturing?\u0022 He was like, \u0022Well, do you do drugs or anything?\u0022 I\u0027m like, \u0022No, I don\u0027t do drugs.\u0022 \u0022Well, your stomach\u0027s not going rupture.\u0022 I really appreciated his confidence. A couple of times I think he could be wrong. But hopefully he\u0027s right. [laughs]\u000A\u000AWhat do you eat the second most of, after hot dogs? Lots of chicken wing contests. I can get into an awesome rhythm with chicken wings.\u000A\u000AI\u0027ve read that you eat the bones sometimes?Yeah, there\u0027s been a couple times where I\u0027ve had to eat the bones. I just close my eyes and try not to think about it. [laughs]\u000A\u000AIs that on accident, or part of the strategy?Okay, well, the first time I did it, it was the Wing Bowl. That\u0027s this ridiculous Philadelphia contest. Most of the contests they weigh the food before and after. But the Wing Bowl, they judge the chicken wings. They\u0027re awful little chicken wings that were impossible to clean, and they kept not giving me credit for them, saying I didn\u0027t clean them. It was easier for me to swallow the chicken wing than clean them, so when they looked at the plate, they had to give me credit. That wasn\u0027t with all of them—just probably about 15 of them that looked like they\u0027d be easier to swallow than clean.\u000A\u000AAnd last, but most importantly, are there competitive eating groupies?I wouldn\u0027t call them groupies, but there\u0027s definitely been... Yeah, there\u0027s fans. I\u0027ll leave it at that.\u000A\u000AFemale fans?Women like winners.",

Well, if the world were one giant friend group (and wouldn&apos;t that be nice?), then Joey Chestnut would be that guy. You know that contest on July 4th out on Coney Island where men and women shove Nathan&apos;s hot dogs into their mouths at lightning speed, and look like they want to vomit, and it makes you kind of want to vomit too, but you can&apos;t stop watching anyway? Well, Joey has won eight of those in a row, and it&apos;s never even close. </p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.1">He&apos;s going for a ninth straight win on Saturday, and trying to break the elusive 70-hot-dogs-in-10-minutes barrier. He set the world record of 69 in 2013, to go along with his deep-fried asparagus record (12.8 lbs in 10 minutes), his Matzoh ball record (78 in eight), his hard boiled eggs record (141 in eight), and many others that are no less impressive/upchuck-inducing. Because it&apos;s Independence weekend and nothing&apos;s more red, white, and blue than mass consumption&#x2014;especially of hot dogs&#x2014;we caught up with Joey on Wednesday. While he said he couldn&apos;t talk about the rumored future one-on-one showdown with the other hot dog-eating legend Takeru Kobayashi, he did tell us about eating cow brain tacos, gastrointestinal distress, and competitive-eating groupies.   </p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.2"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>What exactly does practice consist of for you?</strong><br>My last one, it&apos;s really light. It&apos;s just wanting to get into a rhythm. So I only eat about 30 hot dogs, and lots of water to help digest. Then I&apos;ll be fasting all the way up to 4th of July.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.5"><strong>What are some of the weirder foods you&#x2019;ve had to wolf down?</strong><br>I did kimchi when I was in Korea. That&#x2019;s not that weird. I also did cow brain tacos. I guess that was the weirdest thing I&#x2019;ve ever eaten.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Where was that?</strong><br>It was at a zombie pub-crawl in Minneapolis. </p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>And how many cow brain tacos did you eat?</strong><br>I think it was 54.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>In how many minutes?</strong><br>Eight minutes. It was very fast. I was moving.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>Can you even taste it at that speed?</strong><br>I could taste it. They actually tasted pretty good.  They did a good job cooking them. [<em>laughs</em>] It was kind of like a really, really soft pork. The only weird part was it had a little bit of a metallic taste. It was kind of fatty and it wasn&#x2019;t bad. </p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Do you have memories from childhood of just plowing through certain foods?</strong><br>My mom&#x2019;s cooking. She would make a ton of pasta and I would just eat so much of her pasta when I got home on Friday. And then we would go out to eat. There&#x2019;s an awesome burger place not far from my house. So I&#x2019;d go and get burgers and pie with my little brother.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>After the pasta?</strong><br>Yeah. He was impressed. [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>What do your parents think of all this now?</strong><br>I&#x2019;m lucky. My parents are like super hippies. They were just happy I was going to school and I wasn&#x2019;t getting in trouble. I don&#x2019;t know how I turned out normal. I could have gotten into real trouble. I was able to get a civil engineering degree and travel around the world and eat.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>What about Thanksgiving? Do you take down the whole spread?</strong><br>My parents would be pissed at me if I ate a ton of food at Thanksgiving. They&#x2019;d think I&#x2019;m an asshole. They don&#x2019;t want me to eat my favorite food. Cause I&#x2019;m picky. I would eat all the good dark meat, and eat all the good mashed potatoes.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>What&#x2019;s the conversation like when you go for the annual checkup?</strong><br>Well some doctors are very close-minded. They&#x2019;re like, &#x201C;Oh, it&#x2019;s really unhealthy,&#x201D; and this and that. Well, alright, I know it&#x2019;s not <em>healthy</em>. Running marathons isn&#x2019;t healthy. The doctor I have now does my bloodwork. He talks about how I&#x2019;m feeling and he&#x2019;s really happy with the way my body&#x2019;s working. Towards the end of the summer I actually put on a little weight and every year, I end up trying to lose it. Sometimes I gain a little bit too much weight. </p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Because you&#x2019;re training?</strong><br>When I&#x2019;m training, I&#x2019;m on a really, really strict diet. But during summer, I&#x2019;ll do a practice contest on a Wednesday; then Saturday I&#x2019;ll do an eating contest; Saturday night, I&#x2019;ll go out with all the eaters and people of whatever city I&#x2019;m in, and just drinking, partying on Saturday night&#x2014;doing that once a week really puts it on.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>When you go out after competitions with other eaters, do you guys eat?</strong><br>Not usually. It depends on the food [in the competition]. If it&#x2019;s like chicken wings, where I only did like four pounds of meat, oh yeah, you know I&#x2019;m going to be eating.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>Four pounds of meat isn&#x2019;t enough?</strong><br>I go into these contests really empty. So it&#x2019;s going to move through my stomach into my intestines really quickly. </p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>And what are you drinking after that? Just beer?</strong><br>I like my Jameson. You got to get something that&#x2019;s going to penetrate after all that food. [<em>laughs</em>] Beer will just sit on it.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>When you said you&#x2019;re on a strict diet, what does that diet consist of?</strong>   <br>It&#x2019;s hot dogs, protein supplements, water. After every practice, I can feel when I&#x2019;m pretty much digested. And during that time, I&#x2019;m just taking protein supplements. And then I&#x2019;m drinking tons of lemon water, pretty much just do a cleanse. I want to get everything through my body&#x2026; Even though I&#x2019;m digesting a MASSIVE amount of food, I&#x2019;ll actually lose weight while I&#x2019;m doing that.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>Really? So in that training process you lose weight?</strong><br>I kind of modeled it after a diet where one out of every five days is a binge day, which is pretty much what I&#x2019;m doing. And the other days are fasting. The eating or the practice, it speeds up my metabolism. And once I&#x2019;m not eating, my metabolism is still moving pretty good and I&#x2019;m not eating any food, hardly. So it actually helps me lose weight during a cycle.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>How many pounds do you usually lose?</strong><br>This year, I&#x2019;ll only lost about 20. A little more than 20.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.m"><strong>How many hot dogs would you estimate you eat over those four weeks?</strong><br>Oh my god. It fluctuates because sometimes my practices aren&apos;t necessarily capacity. I&#x2019;ll do 35 dogs and a lot of water. Other practices I&#x2019;ll do absolute capacity, where it&#x2019;s 70 hot dogs. Usually about two practices a week. Every fourth day.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>That&#x2019;s 420 hot dogs.</strong> <br>Yeah. At least 420. I&#x2019;ve bought more than that actually.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.o"><strong>So do you just go to the grocery store and buy mass quantities?</strong><br>They don&#x2019;t sell the Nathan&#x2019;s hot dogs hardly anywhere in the West Coast. So I have to special order them, and I just end up getting Nathan&#x2019;s to ship them to me.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.p"><strong>How many do you have them ship?</strong><br>I have them ship by the thousand. I definitely ate more than [420]. I guess I&#x2019;ve been training a little bit longer this year.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.q"><strong>Is there any sort of athletic component to it at all?</strong><br>I think the whole practice and recovery, it&#x2019;s similar to marathon runners when they&#x2019;re slowly ramping up, they hit it and hit it again. Or even power lifters, who once they hit it, when they get the weight, they can go up a little bit more every time. They hit the muscle group, and they let it recover, they hit it again. </p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.r"><strong>And is there anything you can do to train your eating muscles, whatever those are?</strong><br>Yeah, I do tons of little things. Every morning when I&#x2019;m training, I wake up and first thing I do is I drink a gallon of water, [and] usually count how many gulps it takes. Usually I can do it in about 12 gulps. </p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.s"><strong>I imagine pitchers of beer go down pretty easy.</strong> <br>Pitchers? Yeah. People can still down a pint faster than me, but usually a pitcher, I can beat &#x2018;em. If not the first pitcher, definitely the second.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.t"><strong>So this weekend how much will you gain over the course of the competition?</strong><br>In some of my practice, I&#x2019;ve gained 26 pounds. That&#x2019;s food, hot dog buns, and a lot of water. The next day I&#x2019;ll probably still have about 15 pounds. And then the next day it&#x2019;ll be down to about 4 pounds. So it stays but your body works it off one way or another.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.u"><strong>How many calories is that 26 pounds of hot dogs,</strong><br>That&#x2019;ll be about 70 hot dogs. So that&#x2019;s almost 20,000 I think.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.v"><strong>What are the ten minutes immediately after the contest like?</strong> <br>The first minute&#x2019;s the worst. Before the food settles, where you&#x2019;re feeling like, oh my god, where every burp feels like you might have an accident, like you might be disqualified. Then the burps settle and then I have to do a bunch of interviews. I&#x2019;m pretty much drunk on hot dogs. I feel like there&#x2019;s something wrong with me. All my answers are goofy.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.w"><strong>So when you finish, are you still hungry?</strong> <br>That&#x2019;s probably the only thing that has really changed about me is my feeling of hunger&#x2014;and full. Like I don&#x2019;t really get hungry that much. Sometimes I get cravings for certain foods. But I can go all day without eating. </p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.x"><strong>And you don&#x2019;t really feel full either?</strong><br>Yeah, once I start eating, if there&#x2019;s food I like, I&#x2019;ll keep eating just because I love the taste. I just try to follow what other people are doing at the table. </p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.y"><strong>So what happens after you get back to your hotel?</strong><br>I sleep, I drink liquid, run to the bathroom. Nature&#x2019;s gonna call.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.z"><strong>How many times does <em>that</em> happen in the 24 hours after?</strong><br>Oh my god. [<em>laughs]</em> It happens... [<em>long pause</em>] I&#x2019;d say I&#x2019;m happy if it happens less than eight times. It could be around 10 times. It&#x2019;s weird the way the body works. The human body&#x2019;s amazing. </p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.10"><strong>Can you die from doing this?</strong><br>My doctor, he didn&#x2019;t seem at all worried about anything like that. I was like, &#x201C;What about the stomach rupturing?&#x201D; He was like, &#x201C;Well, do you do drugs or anything?&#x201D; I&#x2019;m like, &#x201C;No, I don&#x2019;t do drugs.&#x201D; &quot;Well, your stomach&#x2019;s not going rupture.&#x201D; I really appreciated his confidence. A couple of times I think he could be wrong. But hopefully he&#x2019;s right. [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.11"><strong>What do you eat the second most of, after hot dogs?</strong> <br>Lots of chicken wing contests. I can get into an awesome rhythm with chicken wings.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.12"><strong>I&#x2019;ve read that you eat the bones sometimes?</strong><br>Yeah, there&#x2019;s been a couple times where I&#x2019;ve had to eat the bones. I just close my eyes and try not to think about it. [<em>laughs</em>]</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.13"><strong>Is that on accident, or part of the strategy?</strong><br>Okay, well, the first time I did it, it was the Wing Bowl. That&#x2019;s this ridiculous Philadelphia contest. Most of the contests they weigh the food before and after. But the Wing Bowl, they judge the chicken wings. They&#x2019;re awful little chicken wings that were impossible to clean, and they kept not giving me credit for them, saying I didn&#x2019;t clean them. It was easier for me to swallow the chicken wing than clean them, so when they looked at the plate, they had to give me credit. That wasn&#x2019;t with all of them&#x2014;just probably about 15 of them that looked like they&#x2019;d be easier to swallow than clean.</p><p data-reactid=".5mxyus3xfk.1.1.0.0.4.14"><strong>And last, but most importantly, are there competitive eating groupies?</strong><br>I wouldn&#x2019;t call them groupies, but there&#x2019;s definitely been...
