  	    "articleBody": "As any UConn basketball fan will tell you, its 2011 National Championship run was only possible because of the Superman-like efforts of point guard Kemba Walker. The peak of his basketball deity ways came during the quarterfinals of what used to be the great Big East Tournament, when Walker hit a buzzer beater while simultaneously evaporating the ankles of Gary McGhee in front of a packed house at Madison Square Garden. It\u0027s the kind of scene every kid with a basketball and a hoop fantasizes about, but it\u0027s Walker\u0027s reality, and will live in college basketball lore for the rest of time. \u000A\u000AHigh off the vapors of his heroic performance, the Charlotte Hornets (Bobcats at the time) drafted Kemba ninth overall in 2011, a relatively high spot for a guard who stands barely six feet tall. These days, league experts will tell you that he\u0027s been moderately good in his four years with the team, but hasn\u0027t had the supporting cast to catapult his game to the level it was at when he was dropping 30 a game at the college level. Plus, playing in a small market like Charlotte has made it difficult for Walker to get the national exposure of other point guards like Kyrie Irving or Derrick Rose, regardless of the fact that his stat line was eerily similar to each of theirs this season. In short, it remains to be seen whether he\u0027ll ever regain that mojo he had as a UConn Husky. But now that the Hornets unloaded troubled guard Lance Stephenson, and added a couple Jeremys to their squad (Lin and Lamb), and it seems entirely possible that this is the year he steps out of the shadow of his college greatness to become one of the league\u0027s best players. A few weeks ago, we caught up with Kemba and asked him what it\u0027s like to have Michael Jordan for a boss, among other things.\u000A\u000AHave you watched [Hornets first round draft pick] Frank Kaminsky play in Summer League at all, or in college at Wisconson?  I watched him in college this past year. I think he\u0027s pretty good, especially for the way we play. You know, he\u0027s like seven feet tall, can shoot the three, and can rebound pretty well. We need guys who can space the floor and that\u0027s a way you can do it. \u000A\u000AWho\u0027s National Championship run was more impressive, Frank\u0027s or yours?Definitely mine. \u000A\u000A\u0022But I love talking to [MJ], because every time he talks to me, the next game I always play my best.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000ADo you ever re-watch your buzzer beater against Pittsburgh and just think, \u0022Wow. I really stunted on them...\u0022? All the time. That shot is my screensaver on my phone actually, so I see a picture of it every day. I watch that whole run all the time. I\u0027ll go through game 1, all the way through to the National Championship game. It\u0027s still surreal to me. And that\u0027s what people always ask me about when I\u0027m walking through the street, because it\u0027s what people know me for. \u000A\u000AWhat was it like to just have that ability to do whatever you wanted on the court during that stretch? To be in the zone like that?I don\u0027t know how I will ever be able to get back in that zone. It was just, I don\u0027t know. It was unbelievable. I think I was just super confident. I have to credit my teammates cause they always kept me confident, but I worked hard too to get to that point. I felt like the best player on the court every night in college. \u000A\u000ADid you instantly feel the faster pace and that players are so much faster and stronger in the NBA?From day one. Even in pre-season, it felt super different. It\u0027s a totally different game. At one point I didn\u0027t think I was going to be able to last, honestly. I was struggling so much. I couldn\u0027t do the same things I was doing in college, I couldn\u0027t make the same shots. I knew I had to work harder, because I\u0027m a small guard. \u000A\u000AWhat are some of your goals going into this season?I don\u0027t really do the whole goal thing. I just want to win. That\u0027s really it. For me, I really feel like when you win, that\u0027s when the accolades. And if my team wins, I think I will have been a big part of that success. If the team wins, good things will come for me. \u000A\u000AAre you gonna miss Lance at all?Yeah. He\u0027s a fun guy to be around. It was kind of hard for him, because I think he just has such high expectations coming off the year he had in Indiana. I don\u0027t know if he was ready for that much responsibility with the team. Everyone just put him at the top of the totem poll without giving him a chance to actually showcase himself. It just didn\u0027t work out for him. It wasn\u0027t the right fit for him with our team. He likes to handle the ball a lot, and I also like to handle the ball a lot. \u000A\u000AA lot of young guys in the league these days care a ton about their style. Do you feel any added pressure to dress well?Nah. A lot of these guys have stylists. I dress myself. I don\u0027t feel any pressure to dress. I like what I like. I don\u0027t step out the box too much like Russellâ€”he kind of wears a lot of exotic stuff. I just keep it pretty simple. \u000A\u000AYou\u0027re wearing Jordans now. Would you want to sign a sneaker deal with Jordan? I would love to. Maybe something nice will happen this offseason. \u000A\u000A[Following this interview, Walker announced he signed a sneaker deal with Jordan brand. Walker was previously an Under Armour athlete.]\u000A\u000AWhat are your favorite Jordans to wear?In college it was the 12s. I wore the white and red 12s in college. \u000A\u000ACould you wear retro Jordans on the court now?I could probably step out in some 11s. They can\u0027t be that heavy. 10s are good, but yeah, 12s might be a little heavy. \u000A\u000AHow involved is MJ himself in the Hornets organization?He\u0027s pretty involved. He\u0027s super competitive. He used to challenge us to 1-on-1 games a few years ago, but not with the point guards. Usually the 2s and 3s. But it\u0027s always a good time when he\u0027s around, especially at the games. He goes in on the refs. \u000A\u000ALike what does hey say?I can\u0027t really say [laughs]. \u000A\u000AWhat does he do to instill that level of competitiveness in you guys?He\u0027ll talk to me if there\u0027s a stretch when I\u0027m not playing so well. I try to avoid him, but it\u0027s not possible. I see him, and I\u0027m like \u0022Damn.\u0022 He\u0027ll get me in a little office and it\u0027s just me and him, and he\u0027ll give me advice. But I love talking to him, because every time he talks to me, the next game I always play my best. \u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s some advice he\u0027s given you recently?During the beginning of last season when we really weren\u0027t playing so well, he was just telling me that I looked timid out there. He told me to be aggressive. And I did, and after that I had, like, a six game stretch with 30-plus points. It\u0027s crazy what a few words do for you coming from the greatest.",

data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.3">What&#39;s next for Kemba Walker, NCAA National Champion and rising NBA star? </h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.0">As any UConn basketball fan will tell you, its 2011 National Championship run was only possible because of the Superman-like efforts of point guard Kemba Walker. The peak of his basketball deity ways came during the quarterfinals of what used to be the great Big East Tournament, when Walker hit a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyF6amZw82M">buzzer beater</a> while simultaneously evaporating the ankles of Gary McGhee in front of a packed house at Madison Square Garden. It&apos;s the kind of scene every kid with a basketball and a hoop fantasizes about, but it&apos;s Walker&apos;s reality, and will live in college basketball lore for the rest of time. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.1">High off the vapors of his heroic performance, the Charlotte Hornets (Bobcats at the time) drafted Kemba ninth overall in 2011, a relatively high spot for a guard who stands barely six feet tall. These days, league experts will tell you that he&apos;s been moderately good in his four years with the team, but hasn&apos;t had the supporting cast to catapult his game to the level it was at when he was dropping 30 a game at the college level. Plus, playing in a small market like Charlotte has made it difficult for Walker to get the national exposure of other point guards like Kyrie Irving or Derrick Rose, regardless of the fact that his stat line was eerily similar to each of theirs this season. In short, it remains to be seen whether he&apos;ll ever regain that mojo he had as a UConn Husky. But now that the Hornets unloaded troubled guard Lance Stephenson, and added a couple Jeremys to their squad (Lin and Lamb), and it seems entirely possible that this is the year he steps out of the shadow of his college greatness to become one of the league&apos;s best players. A few weeks ago, we caught up with Kemba and asked him what it&apos;s like to have Michael Jordan for a boss, among other things.</p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>Have you watched [Hornets first round draft pick] Frank Kaminsky play in Summer League at all, or in college at Wisconson?</strong>  <br>I watched him in college this past year. I think he&apos;s pretty good, especially for the way we play. You know, he&apos;s like seven feet tall, can shoot the three, and can rebound pretty well. We need guys who can space the floor and that&apos;s a way you can do it. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>Who&apos;s National Championship run was more impressive, Frank&apos;s or yours?</strong><br>Definitely mine. </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.5"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&quot;But I love talking to [MJ], because every time he talks to me, the next game I always play my best.&quot;</p></blockquote></span><div class="pullquote-share twitter"><a class="pullquote-share-icon" href="https://twitter.com/share?via=GQ&amp;text=%22%26quot%3BBut%20I%20love%20talking%20to%20%5BMJ%5D%2C%20because%20every%20time%20he%20talks%20to%20me%2C%20the%20next%20game%20I%20always%20play%20my%20best.%26quot%3B%22" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>Do you ever re-watch your buzzer beater against Pittsburgh and just think, &quot;Wow. I really stunted on them...&quot;?</strong> <br>All the time. That shot is my screensaver on my phone actually, so I see a picture of it every day. I watch that whole run all the time. I&apos;ll go through game 1, all the way through to the National Championship game. It&apos;s still surreal to me. And that&apos;s what people always ask me about when I&apos;m walking through the street, because it&apos;s what people know me for. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>What was it like to just have that ability to do whatever you wanted on the court during that stretch? To be in the zone like that?</strong><br>I don&apos;t know how I will ever be able to get back in that zone. It was just, I don&apos;t know. It was unbelievable. I think I was just super confident. I have to credit my teammates cause they always kept me confident, but I worked hard too to get to that point. I felt like the best player on the court every night in college. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Did you instantly feel the faster pace and that players are so much faster and stronger in the NBA?</strong><br>From day one. Even in pre-season, it felt super different. It&apos;s a totally different game. At one point I didn&apos;t think I was going to be able to last, honestly. I was struggling so much. I couldn&apos;t do the same things I was doing in college, I couldn&apos;t make the same shots. I knew I had to work harder, because I&apos;m a small guard. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>What are some of your goals going into this season?</strong><br>I don&apos;t really do the whole goal thing. I just want to win. That&apos;s really it. For me, I really feel like when you win, that&apos;s when the accolades. And if my team wins, I think I will have been a big part of that success. If the team wins, good things will come for me. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>Are you gonna miss Lance at all?</strong><br>Yeah. He&apos;s a fun guy to be around. It was kind of hard for him, because I think he just has such high expectations coming off the year he had in Indiana. I don&apos;t know if he was ready for that much responsibility with the team. Everyone just put him at the top of the totem poll without giving him a chance to actually showcase himself. It just didn&apos;t work out for him. It wasn&apos;t the right fit for him with our team. He likes to handle the ball a lot, and I also like to handle the ball a lot. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>A lot of young guys in the league these days care a ton about their style. Do you feel any added pressure to dress well?</strong><br>Nah. A lot of these guys have stylists. I dress myself. I don&apos;t feel any pressure to dress. I like what I like. I don&apos;t step out the box too much like Russell&#x2014;he kind of wears a lot of exotic stuff. I just keep it pretty simple. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>You&apos;re wearing Jordans now. Would you want to sign a sneaker deal with Jordan? </strong><br>I would love to. Maybe something nice will happen this offseason. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.d">[<em>Following this interview, Walker announced he signed a sneaker deal with Jordan brand. Walker was previously an Under Armour athlete</em>.]</p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.e"><strong>What are your favorite Jordans to wear?</strong><br>In college it was the 12s. I wore the white and red 12s in college. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>Could you wear retro Jordans on the court now?</strong><br>I could probably step out in some 11s. They can&apos;t be that heavy. 10s are good, but yeah, 12s might be a little heavy. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.g"><strong>How involved is MJ himself in the Hornets organization?</strong><br>He&apos;s pretty involved. He&apos;s super competitive. He used to challenge us to 1-on-1 games a few years ago, but not with the point guards. Usually the 2s and 3s. But it&apos;s always a good time when he&apos;s around, especially at the games. He goes in on the refs. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>Like what does hey say?</strong><br>I can&apos;t really say [<em>laughs</em>]. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.i"><strong>What does he do to instill that level of competitiveness in you guys?</strong><br>He&apos;ll talk to me if there&apos;s a stretch when I&apos;m not playing so well. I try to avoid him, but it&apos;s not possible. I see him, and I&apos;m like &quot;Damn.&quot; He&apos;ll get me in a little office and it&apos;s just me and him, and he&apos;ll give me advice. But I love talking to him, because every time he talks to me, the next game I always play my best. </p><p data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>What&apos;s some advice he&apos;s given you recently?</strong><br>During the beginning of last season when we really weren&apos;t playing so well, he was just telling me that I looked timid out there. He told me to be aggressive. And I did, and after that I had, like, a six game stretch with 30-plus points. It&apos;s crazy what a few words do for you coming from the greatest. </p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".2ch688q251c.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div
