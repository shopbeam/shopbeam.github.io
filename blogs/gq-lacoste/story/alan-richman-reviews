  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestPhoto: Courtesy of Blue Hill\u000A\u000AMingling with anything beneath one\u0027s station in life can bring accusations of condescension and arrogance, even if you\u0027re talking about surplus vegetables or insignificant cuts of meat. When I first heard about Dan Barber\u0027s wastED campaign, now in progress at his chic restaurant Blue Hill in Greenwich Village through March 31st, I felt uneasy. While its intention is to teach diners and chefs the joy of cuisine made with ingredients ordinarily thrown out, I was reminded of an inhumane fashion trend of a decade ago called \u0022homeless chic,\u0022 whereby designers created pricy fashions for wealthy people that resembled what bag ladies wore on the street.\u000A\u000AClearly, nobody able to get a reservation for one of the wastED (as in \u0022waste education\u0022) dinners at Blue Hill would be an individual in dire need of nourishment. Few, if any, would return to their Manhattan apartments and begin the tedious process of rendering discarded beef fat into dipping sauce.\u000A\u000AYes, rendered beef fat is currently being offered at Blue Hill, as a condiment.\u000A\u000AI was uncomfortable thinking that the objective of wastED might be to convince poor folks who could not afford excellent food, like dry-aged beef, to settle for less-good food, like a broth made from dry aged beef ends and sprinkled with \u0022mystery vegetables and peels.\u0022\u000A\u000AYes, Dry-Aged Beef Ends Broth is on the menu.\u000A\u000AI wondered if wastED was supposed to demonstrate to the impoverished that if they were going hungry, it was their own fault. If so much in the way of edible waste is readily available to anyone interested in obtaining it, even if Dumpster diving was involved (indeed, Dumpster Dive Vegetable Salad is also a menu option), even those too poor to afford a refrigerator would be just fine when dinner time came around.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AI walked into Blue Hill, startled at the sight. The walls were draped with remay, a light, polyester fabric used on farms as a protective covering over crops. I was shown to my table, a communal one where normal seats had been replaced with high, hard metal stools. In effect, the restaurant had been transformed into a replica of a biohazard laboratory.\u000A\u000AAmong the enticements of wastED is the daily appearance of guest chefs, one per night, virtually all of them celebrities. Their mere presence, of course, makes even cast-off cuisine seem appealing. Dishes composed by the likes of Daniel Humm and Mario Batali tend to be consumed without hesitation.\u000A\u000AMy meal included carrot tops transformed into marmalade and beef tallow candles where the melted, rendered beef fat became a dip for bread made with \u0022spent grain\u0022 from a brewery. The menu offered a seemingly infinite assortment of food nobody had ever eaten before or, to be fair, had any ambition of consuming. My first course turned out to be a snack of deep-fried skate wing cartilage accompanied by tartar sauce accented with smoked fish heads. The menu identified them as whitefish heads, but my server assured me that mine were herring heads. Lucky me.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestPhoto: Courtesy of wastED\u000A\u000AI wish I could say I was impressed, but smoked herring heads have moved to the very bottom of my personal food chain, replacing the previous inhabitant, cauliflower.\u000A\u000AOn this particular day, the kitchen corps was augmented by April Bloomfield, assisted by her chef de cuisine at The Breslin, Christina Lecki. The moment Bloomfield saw me she did something startling: She walked over and hugged me. That just doesn\u0027t happen to restaurant critics. It was very odd.\u000A\u000AThe guest mixologist that night was Audrey Saunders of Pegu Club, who prepared two lovely drinks, a vodka-and-tonic and a quasi-martini, both utilizing vodka infused with lemon pith, the part of the fruit nobody can stand. Saunders said she chose these drinks because she was enthralled by bitter lemon soda as a kid. Bloomfield and Lecki prepared the most ambitious dish on the menu, named Remains of Fins and Field, a bunch of stuff you don\u0027t want to know about in a lovely, warm broth made from turnip tops, pig feet, pig heads, fish bones...lots of those kinds of things. Bloomfield is the master of intensified broths, this one acting as a sauce would under fancier circumstances. The most startling and tasty item in her bowl was a fermented scallion top—you know, the hairy and repulsive part of a green onion that nobody ever eats.\u000A\u000AWas Dumpster Diving salad from Barber tasted fresh and lovely to me, incorporating as it did scraps of miscellaneous veggies including bruised apples, kohlrabi, and carrots, and topped with chopped pistachios. My guest refused to eat it, claiming the idea of the dish made her ill. (She has a weak stomach for a New Yorker.) She also rejected the rendered beef fat, claiming it would go straight to her thighs.\u000A\u000A The triumphs to me were razor clams obtained from the perfectly tasty specimens found inside broken shells—the kind automatically tossed out by cooks—and served with a pig\u0027s ear vinaigrette; breaded and fried monkfish wings, very meaty, that had the pleasing look of pork ribs; the creamiest possible coppa made from pigs raised on waste (which is what I thought all pigs eat, showing how far behind the times I must be); and two stunning condiments: a carrot-top marmalade good enough for the shelves of Ladurée, and a radish-and-turnip-greens salsa that would transform any Mexican meal into a festival. In praising these ingredients, Barber noted that, \u0022turnip greens, radish greens, and carrot tops are free for the taking.\u0022\u000A\u000AA dish charmingly labeled Dog Food was rather flavorsome, I thought, until I realized it actually tasted like meat loaf infused with haggis.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000AIt was about then, despite the offal in my chopped meat, that I realized something exceptional was taking place at Blue Hill. The event, regardless of what it was intended to prove, was transformative. It enraptured everyone: staff, guests, and cooks.\u000A\u000AI don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve ever been in a Manhattan restaurant where so many people appeared so enthralled, so thrilled. The evening turned out to be convincingly instructional and absolutely joyful.\u000A\u000AI think all credit goes to Barber, who is at the peak of his powers, both in the kitchen and as an ethical influence in America. Now in his mid-forties, he has perfected an ability to do everything right. He is the culinary world\u0027s Gandalf (right down to the whites), rallying support to his many culinary causes. From the bar to the kitchen, Blue Hill buzzed with good feeling. Bloomfield mentioned that while she always tries to utilize every bit of food that comes into her kitchen, \u0022the event made us push ourselves deeper.\u0022\u000A\u000AWastED was successful because it did not try to preach or to accomplish too much. The guests, most of them privileged, learned a little dining humility, and the cooks were reminded of something they might well have forgotten: that elite ingredients are not mandatory when preparing admirable food. WastED, which could have been little more than a gimmick—gourmet from garbage, or something like that—instead came off as quite principled, even if I have doubts that it in any way permanently altered the future of food.\u000A\u000AI learned one lesson by scrutinizing the trash piling up in the kitchen of Blue Hill while dinner was going on. Some of it came from the waste from food preparation, some of it was food that came back from the dining room uneaten. America will never be without discarded food. Waste is the gift that keeps on giving.",

Courtesy of Blue Hill</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.1">Mingling with anything beneath one&apos;s station in life can bring accusations of condescension and arrogance, even if you&apos;re talking about surplus vegetables or insignificant cuts of meat. When I first heard about Dan Barber&apos;s wastED campaign, now in progress at his chic restaurant Blue Hill in Greenwich Village through March 31st, I felt uneasy. While its intention is to teach diners and chefs the joy of cuisine made with ingredients ordinarily thrown out, I was reminded of an inhumane fashion trend of a decade ago called &quot;homeless chic,&quot; whereby designers created pricy fashions for wealthy people that resembled what bag ladies wore on the street.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.2">Clearly, nobody able to get a reservation for one of the wastED (as in &quot;waste education&quot;) dinners at Blue Hill would be an individual in dire need of nourishment. Few, if any, would return to their Manhattan apartments and begin the tedious process of rendering discarded beef fat into dipping sauce.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.3">Yes, rendered beef fat is currently being offered at Blue Hill, as a condiment.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.5">I was uncomfortable thinking that the objective of wastED might be to convince poor folks who could not afford excellent food, like dry-aged beef, to settle for less-good food, like a broth made from dry aged beef ends and sprinkled with &quot;mystery vegetables and peels.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.6">Yes, Dry-Aged Beef Ends Broth is on the menu.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.7">I wondered if wastED was supposed to demonstrate to the impoverished that if they were going hungry, it was their own fault. If so much in the way of edible waste is readily available to anyone interested in obtaining it, even if Dumpster diving was involved (indeed, Dumpster Dive Vegetable Salad is also a menu option), even those too poor to afford a refrigerator would be just fine when dinner time came around.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.8">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.9">I walked into Blue Hill, startled at the sight. The walls were draped with remay, a light, polyester fabric used on farms as a protective covering over crops. I was shown to my table, a communal one where normal seats had been replaced with high, hard metal stools. In effect, the restaurant had been transformed into a replica of a biohazard laboratory.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.a">Among the enticements of wastED is the daily appearance of guest chefs, one per night, virtually all of them celebrities. Their mere presence, of course, makes even cast-off cuisine seem appealing. Dishes composed by the likes of Daniel Humm and Mario Batali tend to be consumed without hesitation.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.b">My meal included carrot tops transformed into marmalade and beef tallow candles where the melted, rendered beef fat became a dip for bread made with &quot;spent grain&quot; from a brewery. The menu offered a seemingly infinite assortment of food nobody had ever eaten before or, to be fair, had any ambition of consuming. My first course turned out to be a snack of deep-fried skate wing cartilage accompanied by tartar sauce accented with smoked fish heads. The menu identified them as whitefish heads, but my server assured me that mine were herring heads. Lucky me.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.c"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/5582f6053655c24c6c95347d/master/w_806/food-and-travel-richman-2015-March-wasted-bull-hill-farms-02.jpg" alt="food-and-travel-richman-2015-March-wasted-bull-hill-farms-02.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Falan-richman-reviews&amp;t=food-and-travel-richman-2015-March-wasted-bull-hill-farms-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Falan-richman-reviews&amp;t=food-and-travel-richman-2015-March-wasted-bull-hill-farms-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Falan-richman-reviews&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f6053655c24c6c95347d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-richman-2015-March-wasted-bull-hill-farms-02.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-richman-2015-March-wasted-bull-hill-farms-02.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Falan-richman-reviews&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F5582f6053655c24c6c95347d%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ffood-and-travel-richman-2015-March-wasted-bull-hill-farms-02.jpg&amp;description=food-and-travel-richman-2015-March-wasted-bull-hill-farms-02.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div><figcaption class="caption callout-image-caption"><div class="credits">Photo: Courtesy of wastED</div></figcaption></figure></div><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.d">I wish I could say I was impressed, but smoked herring heads have moved to the very bottom of my personal food chain, replacing the previous inhabitant, cauliflower.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.e">On this particular day, the kitchen corps was augmented by April Bloomfield, assisted by her chef de cuisine at The Breslin, Christina Lecki. The moment Bloomfield saw me she did something startling: She walked over and hugged me. That just doesn&apos;t happen to restaurant critics. It was very odd.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.f">The guest mixologist that night was Audrey Saunders of Pegu Club, who prepared two lovely drinks, a vodka-and-tonic and a quasi-martini, both utilizing vodka infused with lemon pith, the part of the fruit nobody can stand. Saunders said she chose these drinks because she was enthralled by bitter lemon soda as a kid. Bloomfield and Lecki prepared the most ambitious dish on the menu, named Remains of Fins and Field, a bunch of stuff you don&apos;t want to know about in a lovely, warm broth made from turnip tops, pig feet, pig heads, fish bones...lots of those kinds of things. Bloomfield is the master of intensified broths, this one acting as a sauce would under fancier circumstances. The most startling and tasty item in her bowl was a fermented scallion top&#x2014;you know, the hairy and repulsive part of a green onion that nobody ever eats.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.g">Was Dumpster Diving salad from Barber tasted fresh and lovely to me, incorporating as it did scraps of miscellaneous veggies including bruised apples, kohlrabi, and carrots, and topped with chopped pistachios. My guest refused to eat it, claiming the idea of the dish made her ill. (She has a weak stomach for a New Yorker.) She also rejected the rendered beef fat, claiming it would go straight to her thighs.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.h"> The triumphs to me were razor clams obtained from the perfectly tasty specimens found inside broken shells&#x2014;the kind automatically tossed out by cooks&#x2014;and served with a pig&apos;s ear vinaigrette; breaded and fried monkfish wings, very meaty, that had the pleasing look of pork ribs; the creamiest possible coppa made from pigs raised on waste (which is what I thought all pigs eat, showing how far behind the times I must be); and two stunning condiments: a carrot-top marmalade good enough for the shelves of Ladur&#xE9;e, and a radish-and-turnip-greens salsa that would transform any Mexican meal into a festival. In praising these ingredients, Barber noted that, &quot;turnip greens, radish greens, and carrot tops are free for the taking.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.i">A dish charmingly labeled Dog Food was rather flavorsome, I thought, until I realized it actually tasted like meat loaf infused with haggis.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.j">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.k">It was about then, despite the offal in my chopped meat, that I realized something exceptional was taking place at Blue Hill. The event, regardless of what it was intended to prove, was transformative. It enraptured everyone: staff, guests, and cooks.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.l">I don&apos;t believe I&apos;ve ever been in a Manhattan restaurant where so many people appeared so enthralled, so thrilled. The evening turned out to be convincingly instructional and absolutely joyful.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.m">I think all credit goes to Barber, who is at the peak of his powers, both in the kitchen and as an ethical influence in America. Now in his mid-forties, he has perfected an ability to do everything right. He is the culinary world&apos;s Gandalf (right down to the whites), rallying support to his many culinary causes. From the bar to the kitchen, Blue Hill buzzed with good feeling. Bloomfield mentioned that while she always tries to utilize every bit of food that comes into her kitchen, &quot;the event made us push ourselves deeper.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.n">WastED was successful because it did not try to preach or to accomplish too much. The guests, most of them privileged, learned a little dining humility, and the cooks were reminded of something they might well have forgotten: that elite ingredients are not mandatory when preparing admirable food. WastED, which could have been little more than a gimmick&#x2014;gourmet from garbage, or something like that&#x2014;instead came off as quite principled, even if I have doubts that it in any way permanently altered the future of food.</p><p data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.4.o">I learned one lesson by scrutinizing the trash piling up in the kitchen of Blue Hill while dinner was going on. Some of it came from the waste from food preparation, some of it was food that came back from the dining room uneaten. America will never be without discarded food. Waste is the gift that keeps on giving.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".pwv5gmywow.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
