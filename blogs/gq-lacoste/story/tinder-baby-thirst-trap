  	    "articleBody": "I am 14 profiles deep during a Tinder swipefest when James, 27, catches my eye. He\u0027s cute and a little bro-y, and his bio mentions running marathons. I\u0027m intrigued, so I tap on his photo to see more. About halfway through his gallery, there it is. A photo of him with a toddler in his arms. They\u0027re both clowning for the camera, and while it would be one thing to be proud of your status as a single father, James\u0027s bio tells another story.\u000A\u000A\u0022Not my kid,\u0022 it reads, tacked on as if not having kids were another hobby.\u000A\u000ASuddenly, his profile is thrust into a world of conflict. James wants to include the photo of this adorable child, who seems to be having the time of his little life in James\u0027s arms. Yet James also wants both me and the greater female population of New York City know that the child is not his.\u000A\u000AAnd still, the kid is so cute and so happy in James\u0027s arms that I feel a twinge somewhere between my heart and my ovaries. It\u0027s a feeling I know well, if only because it is how I feel whenever I look at a photo of North West, a human being who may or may not have been placed on this earth by my mother to trick me into having grandchildren.\u000A\u000ATinder is making my fallopian tubes hurt, so I close the app. I don\u0027t need that stress. But then I open Instagram, and it\u0027s there again! Men with babies. Babies everywhere!\u000A\u000AThe baby might be the ultimate thirst trap, a tell-tale sign that what you\u0027re dealing with is a man who believes that the best way to a woman\u0027s heart is through her ovaries.Twitter\u000A\u000ALook, dudes. We see what you\u0027re doing, with your niece or your nephew or your friend\u0027s kid that\u0027s making you reconsider this whole single-bachelor lifestyle. You\u0027re holding the kid, you\u0027re feeling things about a future child you might one day create yourself (maybe with us? Hopeful heart-eyed emoji, wink emoji, baby emoji) and how much love you have for this little human you did not create. And so, you post it on Instagram. And then the likes start piling up.\u000A\u000A\u0022I know they\u0027re doing it to make us think, Oh, they\u0027re so sensitive, they love babies and cats and they will be a great dad to my unborn children,\u0027\u0027 my friend Olivia told me, before adding that it makes her angry that \u0022guys think girls are that easily persuaded into liking someone, and that a lot of girls will fall for it.\u0022 On Tinder, she\u0027s never let it be a deal breaker or an automatic left-swipe, but it raises a red flag.\u000A\u000AYou see, the baby might be the ultimate thirst trap, a tell-tale sign that what you\u0027re dealing with is a man who believes that the best way to a woman\u0027s heart is through her ovaries. They\u0027re not the only ones with a personal brand, of course. The ice cream cone and avocado toast are the calling card of the Basic Bitch.    Sick abs and thinly-veiled dick silhouettes in gray sweats are the prime currency for thirst-trap-setting bros of a certain aesthetic. And once upon a time, tiny dogs were props, too (and Aziz Ansari can back me up here).\u000A\u000APoint is, on some level, it\u0027s perfectly okay to flaunt. If you\u0027re diligently counting your macros and shredding it up in the gym, go ahead show off those V-lines! If you have the kind of job that won\u0027t call you into HR for posting a dickprint pic, by all means, eggplant emoji away!\u000A\u000ABut now, we have entered the era of the baby. And unlike a melting ice cream cone or gym selfie, your best friend\u0027s baby is not yours to use as a prop. What are we congratulating you on? Maintaining your friendship with a guy who is more inclined to spend Friday nights in with his wife and child while you pound another one down at the bar? Holding a child for a full 30 seconds without dropping it? Chronicling your potential as daddy material?  \u000A\u000A(Of course, if it is your child, and you played a part in making that thing, by all means, crow about that all you want. You made a life! You are doing a reasonably good job so far at keeping that life alive! Good for you!)\u000A\u000AIs this a little superficial to judge immediately ? Perhaps. But what is Tinder supposed to be if not superficial? All it provides are a few photos and a space for a witty bio. People have made the argument before that, in a way, the app more closely mirrors classic IRL dating because seeing someone out in the wild is largely superficial. You see them at a bar, you think they\u0027re cute, you walk up to them. But if they were, say, holding a baby in a bar? That might complicate things. (Also: Why is your baby at a bar?!)\u000A\u000ASure, maybe the kid is your niece, and you genuinely love her, and family means a lot to you, because you are a decent man. It\u0027s very likely that she\u0027s very cute, too—it\u0027s hard to not be cute when you\u0027re two feet tall. When I talked to my friend Steven about it, he said, \u0022I think it certainly is a sympathetic set of pictures. Look at me, being gentle and responsible.\u0022\u000A\u000AAnother friend, Chris, agreed. \u0022I feel like it\u0027s definitely bait because all profile photos have at least a little thought put into them,\u0022 he said, \u0022and by including a baby that\u0027s not yours, surely you\u0027re trying to portray yourself in a way that you believe is attractive.\u0022 Photos with babies, he argues, are \u0022likely more calculated than most.\u0022\u000A\u000AMost of the time I have an unofficial \u0022always swipe left\u0022 rule for profiles with ‘not-my-kid\u0027-kids in them, but forced myself to swipe right to see what I was missing out on. It was surprisingly difficult to remember to move my thumb right instead of left, because I\u0027d grown so accustomed to immediately react to the child-shaped red flag. But I made a few matches, and several men with whom I struck up conversations on Tinder grew defensive when I asked why they had a photo with a child that they maintained wasn\u0027t theirs. They immediately said the child was a relative, usually a niece or a nephew, though I did get a few baby cousins (and, notably, no younger siblings). One man promptly unmatched me when I inquired about the photo. Still another confessed that the tiny human being with whom he was snuggling face-to-face was his nephew, but didn\u0027t seem to want to talk any more about what was the very first impression on his profile.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ABut are we really talking on a dating app about this? Isn\u0027t this where we banter playfully before exchanging phone numbers and moving from app to IRL? And even if family means a lot to you, why would I be meeting your niece before I meet your mother? Would you post the same photo of you with your mom? You probably wouldn\u0027t, would you? Because you know that being close with your mom just doesn\u0027t do nearly the same thing to our ovaries.\u000A\u000AAnd that\u0027s what\u0027s in play. That pang we\u0027re supposed to get deep down in our lady region. This one, that pang says. This one could be baby daddy material. Have sex with this one and you too can have a baby that possibly looks sorta like this! \u000A\u000AYou see a guy at a bar, you think they\u0027re cute, you walk up to them. But if they were, say, holding a baby in a bar? That might complicate things.Twitter\u000A\u000A(And though women are not exempt from the photos-with-babies rule (Rihanna\u0027s Insta-doting on her niece Majesty and Khloe Kardashian posting about her nieces and nephews are notable examples), we just don\u0027t fawn over women the same way we do men. Life tip: \u0022Aw, she\u0027d make such a good mom!\u0022 is a phrase that can strike fear into a woman\u0027s heart. Is eventual motherhood still the ultimate endgame? Is that all we\u0027re good for? What if we don\u0027t know if we want to be moms yet?)\u000A\u000A\u0022Most of the women I know are very career-focused and less worried about babies. I think I\u0027m probably way more excited to meet and play with babies than most women I\u0027ve dated,\u0022 Steven told me. \u0022That said, I know very few guys who are like, ‘I NEED TO BE A DAD, NOW!\u0027\u0022\u000A\u000AYet thinking a man would be a good dad is somehow seen as something women want, as if it makes a guy somehow less of a threat—more nurturing, just because he has the capacity to hold a tiny human without it disintegrating. While guys often joke about women being baby-crazy, they\u0027re they\u0027re ones who are still trying to bait us with the possibility of Yeah, maybe. The potential for a mate is primal, my friends. Even when we\u0027re not sure if we want kids, how much of us is hardwired to look at a baby so we\u0027re like, Okay, maybe one day?\u000A\u000APlease—don\u0027t do this to us. Maybe babies really are just cute. But so are small dogs. When in doubt, stick with puppies.",

class="body-text" data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.0">I am 14 profiles deep during a Tinder swipefest when James, 27, catches my eye. He&#x2019;s cute and a little bro-y, and his bio mentions running marathons. I&#x2019;m intrigued, so I tap on his photo to see more. About halfway through his gallery, there it is. A photo of him with a toddler in his arms. They&#x2019;re both clowning for the camera, and while it would be one thing to be proud of your status as a single father, James&#x2019;s bio tells another story.</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.1">&#x201C;Not my kid,&#x201D; it reads, tacked on as if not having kids were another hobby.</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.2">Suddenly, his profile is thrust into a world of conflict. James wants to include the photo of this adorable child, who seems to be having the time of his little life in James&#x2019;s arms. Yet James also wants both me and the greater female population of New York City know that the child is not his.</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.3">And still, the kid is <em>so cute</em> and <em>so happy</em> in James&#x2019;s arms that I feel a twinge somewhere between my heart and my ovaries. It&#x2019;s a feeling I know well, if only because it is how I feel whenever I look at a photo of North West, a human being who may or may not have been placed on this earth by my mother to trick me into having grandchildren.</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.5">Tinder is making my fallopian tubes hurt, so I close the app. I don&#x2019;t need that stress. But then I open Instagram, and <em><a href="https://instagram.com/p/11kH4NMz3C/">it&#x2019;s there again</a></em>! Men with babies. Babies everywhere!</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.6"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>The baby might be the ultimate thirst trap, a tell-tale sign that what you&#x2019;re dealing with is a man who believes that the best way to a woman&#x2019;s heart is through her ovaries.</p></blockquote></span><div class="pullquote-share twitter"><a class="pullquote-share-icon" href="https://twitter.com/share?via=GQ&amp;text=%22The%20baby%20might%20be%20the%20ultimate%20thirst%20trap%2C%20a%20tell-tale%20sign%20that%20what%20you%E2%80%99re%20dealing%20with%20is%20a%20man%20who%20believes%20that%20the%20best%20way%20to%20a%20woman%E2%80%99s%20heart%20is%20through%20her%20ovaries.%22" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.7">Look, dudes. We see what you&#x2019;re doing, with your niece or your nephew or your friend&#x2019;s kid that&#x2019;s making you reconsider this whole single-bachelor lifestyle. You&#x2019;re holding the kid, you&#x2019;re feeling things about a future child you might one day create yourself (maybe with us? Hopeful heart-eyed emoji, wink emoji, baby emoji) and how much <em>love</em> you have for this little human you did not create. And so, you post it on Instagram. And then the likes start piling up.</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.8">&#x201C;I know they&apos;re doing it to make us think, Oh, they&apos;re so sensitive, they love babies and cats and they will be a great dad to my unborn children,&#x2019;&#x2019; my friend Olivia told me, before adding that it makes her angry that &#x201C;guys think girls are that easily persuaded into liking someone, and that a lot of girls will fall for it.&#x201D; On Tinder, she&#x2019;s never let it be a deal breaker or an automatic left-swipe, but it raises a red flag.</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.9">You see, the baby might be the ultimate thirst trap, a tell-tale sign that what you&#x2019;re dealing with is a man who believes that the best way to a woman&#x2019;s heart is through her ovaries. They&#x2019;re not the only ones with a personal brand, of course. The ice cream cone and avocado toast are the calling card of the <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/04/basic-bitch-who-is-she.html">Basic Bitch</a>.    Sick abs and <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/tracyclayton/dem-sweatpants-doe#.au1xYJvN5">thinly-veiled dick silhouettes</a> in gray sweats are the prime currency for thirst-trap-setting bros of a certain aesthetic. And once upon a time, tiny dogs were props, too (and <a href="http://www.gq.com/life/relationships/201506/aziz-ansari-tinder-gf">Aziz Ansari</a> can back me up here).</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.a">Point is, on some level, it&apos;s perfectly okay to flaunt. If you&#x2019;re diligently counting your macros and shredding it up in the gym, go ahead show off those V-lines! If you have the kind of job that won&#x2019;t call you into HR for posting a dickprint pic, by all means, eggplant emoji away!</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.b">But now, we have entered the era of the baby. And unlike a melting ice cream cone or gym selfie, your best friend&#x2019;s baby is <em>not</em> yours to use as a prop. What are we congratulating you on? Maintaining your friendship with a guy who is more inclined to spend Friday nights in with his wife and child while you pound another one down at the bar? Holding a child for a full 30 seconds without dropping it? Chronicling your potential as daddy material?  </p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.c">(Of course, if it is your child, and you played a part in making that thing, by all means, crow about that all you want. You made a life! You are doing a reasonably good job so far at keeping that life alive! Good for you!)</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.d">Is this a little superficial to judge immediately ? Perhaps. But what is Tinder supposed to be if not superficial? All it provides are a few photos and a space for a witty bio. People have made the argument before that, in a way, the app more closely mirrors classic IRL dating because seeing someone out in the wild is largely superficial. You see them at a bar, you think they&#x2019;re cute, you walk up to them. But if they were, say, holding a baby in a bar? That might complicate things. (Also: Why is your baby at a bar?!)</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.e">Sure, maybe the kid is your niece, and you genuinely love her, and family means a lot to you, because you are a decent man. It&#x2019;s very likely that she&#x2019;s very cute, too&#x2014;it&#x2019;s hard to not be cute when you&#x2019;re two feet tall. When I talked to my friend Steven about it, he said, &#x201C;I think it certainly is a sympathetic set of pictures. Look at me, being gentle and responsible.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.f">Another friend, Chris, agreed. &#x201C;I feel like it&#x2019;s definitely bait because all profile photos have at least a little thought put into them,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;and by including a baby that&#x2019;s not yours, surely you&#x2019;re trying to portray yourself in a way that you believe is attractive.&#x201D; Photos with babies, he argues, are &#x201C;likely more calculated than most.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.g">Most of the time I have an unofficial &#x201C;always swipe left&#x201D; rule for profiles with &#x2018;not-my-kid&#x2019;-kids in them, but forced myself to swipe right to see what I was missing out on. It was surprisingly difficult to remember to move my thumb right instead of left, because I&#x2019;d grown so accustomed to immediately react to the child-shaped red flag. But I made a few matches, and several men with whom I struck up conversations on Tinder grew defensive when I asked why they had a photo with a child that they maintained wasn&#x2019;t theirs. They immediately said the child was a relative, usually a niece or a nephew, though I did get a few baby cousins (and, notably, no younger siblings). One man promptly unmatched me when I inquired about the photo. Still another confessed that the tiny human being with whom he was snuggling face-to-face was his nephew, but didn&#x2019;t seem to want to talk any more about what was the very first impression on his profile.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.h"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55df8e6df4a422ae368feab9/master/w_806/tinder-discussion.png" alt="tinder-discussion.png"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftinder-baby-thirst-trap&amp;t=tinder-discussion.png"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftinder-baby-thirst-trap&amp;t=tinder-discussion.png" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftinder-baby-thirst-trap&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55df8e6df4a422ae368feab9%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftinder-discussion.png&amp;description=tinder-discussion.png"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Ftinder-baby-thirst-trap&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55df8e6df4a422ae368feab9%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Ftinder-discussion.png&amp;description=tinder-discussion.png" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.i">But are we really talking on a dating app about this? Isn&#x2019;t this where we banter playfully before exchanging phone numbers and moving from app to IRL? And even if family means a lot to you, why would I be meeting your niece before I meet your mother? Would you post the same photo of you with your mom? You probably wouldn&#x2019;t, would you? Because you know that being close with your mom just doesn&#x2019;t do nearly the same thing to our ovaries.</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.j">And <em>that&#x2019;s</em> what&#x2019;s in play.

Life tip: &#x201C;Aw, she&#x2019;d make such a good mom!&#x201D; is a phrase that can strike fear into a woman&#x2019;s heart. Is eventual motherhood still the ultimate endgame? Is that all we&#x2019;re good for? What if we don&#x2019;t know if we want to be moms yet?)</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.m">&#x201C;Most of the women I know are very career-focused and less worried about babies. I think I&apos;m probably way more excited to meet and play with babies than most women I&apos;ve dated,&#x201D; Steven told me. &#x201C;That said, I know very few guys who are like, &#x2018;I NEED TO BE A DAD, NOW!&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.n">Yet thinking a man would be a good dad is somehow seen as something women want, as if it makes a guy somehow less of a threat&#x2014;more nurturing, just because he has the capacity to hold a tiny human without it disintegrating. While guys often joke about women being baby-crazy, they&#x2019;re they&apos;re ones who are still trying to bait us with the possibility of Yeah, <em>maybe</em>. The potential for a mate is primal, my friends. Even when we&#x2019;re not sure if we want kids, how much of us is hardwired to look at a baby so we&#x2019;re like, <em>Okay, maybe one day</em>?</p><p data-reactid=".rjuh0hoxds.1.1.0.0.4.o">Please&#x2014;don&apos;t do this to us.
