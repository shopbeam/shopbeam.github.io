  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI was about a month into reporting my profile of Ben Carson. \u0022That should tell you how I feel about GQ,\u0022 Williams said.\u000A\u000ASmall in stature but gargantuan in personality, Williams has a shaved head and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of colorful socks. He also boasts a black, hard-plastic business card that looks like it was issued by Visa. Williams is one of those fantastic, only-in-Washington characters—the consummate man-behind-the-man for a dizzying variety of men. He was born and raised in South Carolina and made his way to D.C. in the early \u002780s as an aide to his home state\u0027s senior Senator, Strom Thurmond. Thurmond would become Williams\u0027s mentor and Williams would eventually become one of Thurmond\u0027s most trusted advisors. When Thurmond would have his hair transplants dyed their peculiar shade of orange, he\u0027d summon Williams to make sure they were the right color. \u0022He knew I was brutally honest,\u0022 Williams told me.\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AAfter Thurmond, Williams went to work as the confidential assistant for an up-and-comer named Clarence Thomas, who had been appointed by Ronald Reagan to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Years later,during Thomas\u0027s bruising Supreme Court confirmation, Williams spoke out in defense of his old boss, and against his old colleague Anita Hill. Once Thomas made it to the Court, Williams took it upon himself to keep Thomas, who famously refuses to read the newspaper, plugged into the outside world—tapping his ridiculously diverse network to arrange for the Justice to play hoops with Charles Barkley in the Court\u0027s gym or break bread with Democratic strategist Donna Brazile.\u000A\u000AOf course, none of that work pays the bills—at least not the bills you have when you own a home like the one Williams does on Capitol Hill—so, in true D.C. fashion, he\u0027s found ways to monetize his Svengali status. He teamed up with Stedman Graham (of Oprah paramour fame) to found an international public relations firm. He\u0027s also carved out a niche as a prominent (and indefatigable) black conservative pundit, with a syndicated newspaper column and his own TV and radio shows. During Carson\u0027s trip to Israel, Williams would frequently disappear to call in to some obscure radio show back in the States to offer his commentary on the news of the day. One afternoon, in the Old City of Jerusalem, he performed a modern miracle—finding a Wifi signal—so that he could use his iPad to do a Skype interview with a Fox show. Williams has also branched out into media ownership. In the last two years, he\u0027s purchased six television stations in Alabama, Michigan, South Carolina, Nevada and Pennsylvania.\u000A\u000AWhen Williams is described as Carson\u0027s \u0022business manager,\u0022 it sounds like a euphemism, but it\u0027s literally true. The two became friendly about 22 years ago, after Carson appeared on Williams\u0027s television show. Soon Williams says that he realized his friend\u0027s business could be managed better. As Williams tells it, Carson \u0022was looking to sell some property and minimize his tas, so I turned him onto the 1031 exchanges\u0022—a financial strategy that\u0027s used to shield investors from capital gains tas. Before long, Williams wasn\u0027t handling just Carson\u0027s business affairs, he was employing Carson\u0027s sons through his production company and helping Carson\u0027s wife, Candy, import 300 pounds of Egyptian marble for the renovation of the Carson family home. When Carson turned his attentions toward politics, it was only natural that he\u0027d turn to Williams for assistance.\u000A\u000AWilliams has proven to be an able Sherpa. Although Carson is a legitimate grassroots phenomenon, Williams hasn\u0027t been shy about spreading the fertilizer for the man he calls \u0022Doc.\u0022 Through his television stations, which Williams purchased from Sinclair Broadcasting, he\u0027s provided Carson with a regular platform on 150 or so other Sinclair stations. While those appearances aren\u0027t as prominent as Carson\u0027s work for Fox News (where Carson was, until late last year, a paid contributor), they allow him to often reach more viewers. Williams has also plugged Carson into the mainstream media. Last Friday, after Carson committed a number of foreign policy gaffes during a radio appearance, Williams roused Bloomberg Politics reporter David Weigel at 7:45 in the morning to offer up an interview with Carson so that Carson could try to clean up the mess. Above all else, Williams is an excellent hype man, constantly talking up Carson to reporters (\u0022This guy is a voracious reader,\u0022 he told me) and even suggesting lines of inquiry. \u0022Be sure to ask Dr. Carson about Kanye West,\u0022 Williams instructed me. It turns out Carson and the rapper spoke on the phone last year. \u0022He wanted to talk to me and tell me he admired me,\u0022 Carson told me. \u0022I was quite impressed with his intelligence.\u0022\u000A\u000AWilliams has a deep and abiding faith in Carson—and it\u0027s that faith, as much as his affinity for this magazine, that likely explains why Williams allowed me so much access to Carson. Williams believes that if reporters just get to know the man he knows, then they will inevitably see the man he sees: a brilliant doctor, a future president, an actual sage. One afternoon, Williams told me about the time last year he took Carson to visit another one of his friends, Maya Angelou, at her North Carolina home. At the end of their visit, Williams said, Angelou invited both men to attend her annual Fourth of July party. Williams knew that Carson had other plans for Independence Day, so, as they were leaving, he teased his friend that he\u0027d have to miss Angelou\u0027s soiree. Carson replied that Williams would have to miss the party, too. \u0022She reeked of death,\u0022 Williams said Carson told him. \u0022She\u0027ll be dead in three weeks.\u0022\u000A\u000AWilliams continued with the story. \u0022Two weeks and five days later, I was having breakfast at the Monocle when I got a call that Dr. Angelou had died,\u0022 Williams told me. I must have looked confused, trying to figure out the import of this anecdote, because Williams hit me in the arm. \u0022Doc was just two days off!\u0022 he said.",

into reporting <a href="http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201504/ben-carson-tea-party) when it finally dawned on me why I&#x2019;d been given so much access to the pediatric-neurosurgeon-turned-presidential-candidate. I was watching Barack Obama&#x2019;s State of the Union address with Carson in the Capitol Hill home of Carson&#x2019;s business manager and gatekeeper, Armstrong Williams, when I noticed an unusual picture hanging to the left of the television. It was a mock-up of a phony _GQ_ cover&#x2014;featuring a giant picture of Williams (alongside an eclectic mix of headlines:" title="Angela Bassett,&quot; &quot;George W. Bush,&quot; and &quot;Egyptian Jewelry">my profile of Ben Carson</a>. &quot;That should tell you how I feel about <em>GQ</em>,&quot; Williams said.</p><p data-reactid=".281hoqxnnk0.1.1.0.0.4.2">Small in stature but gargantuan in personality, Williams has a shaved head and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of colorful socks. He also boasts a black, hard-plastic business card that looks like it was issued by Visa. Williams is one of those fantastic, only-in-Washington characters&#x2014;the consummate man-behind-the-man for a dizzying variety of men. He was born and raised in South Carolina and made his way to D.C. in the early &#x2019;80s as an aide to his home state&#x2019;s senior Senator, Strom Thurmond. Thurmond would become Williams&#x2019;s mentor and Williams would eventually become one of Thurmond&#x2019;s most trusted advisors. When Thurmond would have his hair transplants dyed their peculiar shade of orange, he&#x2019;d summon Williams to make sure they were the right color. &quot;He knew I was brutally honest,&quot; Williams told me.</p><div class="embed image" data-reactid=".281hoqxnnk0.1.1.0.0.4.3"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55828e721177d66d68d53748/master/w_806/blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2015-03-cover-thumb-624x785-287812.jpg" alt="blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2015-03-cover-thumb-624x785-287812.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farmstrong-williams-ben-carson-manager&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2015-03-cover-thumb-624x785-287812.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farmstrong-williams-ben-carson-manager&amp;t=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2015-03-cover-thumb-624x785-287812.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farmstrong-williams-ben-carson-manager&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828e721177d66d68d53748%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-assets_c-2015-03-cover-thumb-624x785-287812.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2015-03-cover-thumb-624x785-287812.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Farmstrong-williams-ben-carson-manager&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55828e721177d66d68d53748%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fblogs-the-feed-assets_c-2015-03-cover-thumb-624x785-287812.jpg&amp;description=blogs-the-feed-assets_c-2015-03-cover-thumb-624x785-287812.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure></div><p data-reactid=".281hoqxnnk0.1.1.0.0.4.5">After Thurmond, Williams went to work as the confidential assistant for an up-and-comer named Clarence Thomas, who had been appointed by Ronald Reagan to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Years later,during Thomas&#x2019;s bruising Supreme Court confirmation, Williams spoke out in defense of his old boss, and against his old colleague Anita Hill. Once Thomas made it to the Court, Williams took it upon himself to keep Thomas, who famously refuses to read the newspaper, plugged into the outside world&#x2014;tapping his ridiculously diverse network to arrange for the Justice to play hoops with Charles Barkley in the Court&#x2019;s gym or break bread with Democratic strategist Donna Brazile.</p><p data-reactid=".281hoqxnnk0.1.1.0.0.4.6">Of course, none of that work pays the bills&#x2014;at least not the bills you have when you own a home like the one Williams does on Capitol Hill&#x2014;so, in true D.C. fashion, he&#x2019;s found ways to monetize his Svengali status. He teamed up with Stedman Graham (of Oprah paramour fame) to found an international public relations firm. He&#x2019;s also carved out a niche as a prominent (and indefatigable) black conservative pundit, with a syndicated newspaper column and his own TV and radio shows. During Carson&#x2019;s trip to Israel, Williams would frequently disappear to call in to some obscure radio show back in the States to offer his commentary on the news of the day. One afternoon, in the Old City of Jerusalem, he performed a modern miracle&#x2014;finding a Wifi signal&#x2014;so that he could use his iPad to do a Skype interview with a Fox show. Williams has also branched out into media ownership. In the last two years, he&#x2019;s purchased six television stations in Alabama, Michigan, South Carolina, Nevada and Pennsylvania.</p><p data-reactid=".281hoqxnnk0.1.1.0.0.4.7">When Williams is described as Carson&#x2019;s &quot;business manager,&quot; it sounds like a euphemism, but it&#x2019;s literally true. The two became friendly about 22 years ago, after Carson appeared on Williams&#x2019;s television show. Soon Williams says that he realized his friend&#x2019;s business could be managed better. As Williams tells it, Carson &quot;was looking to sell some property and minimize his tas, so I turned him onto the 1031 exchanges&quot;&#x2014;a financial strategy that&#x2019;s used to shield investors from capital gains tas. Before long, Williams wasn&#x2019;t handling just Carson&#x2019;s business affairs, he was employing Carson&#x2019;s sons through his production company and helping Carson&#x2019;s wife, Candy, import 300 pounds of Egyptian marble for the renovation of the Carson family home. When Carson turned his attentions toward politics, it was only natural that he&#x2019;d turn to Williams for assistance.</p><p data-reactid=".281hoqxnnk0.1.1.0.0.4.8">Williams has proven to be an able Sherpa. Although Carson is a legitimate grassroots phenomenon, Williams hasn&#x2019;t been shy about spreading the fertilizer for the man he calls &quot;Doc.&quot; Through his television stations, which Williams purchased from Sinclair Broadcasting, he&#x2019;s provided Carson with a regular platform on 150 or so other Sinclair stations. While those appearances aren&#x2019;t as prominent as Carson&#x2019;s work for Fox News (where Carson was, until late last year, a paid contributor), they allow him to often reach more viewers. Williams has also plugged Carson into the mainstream media. Last Friday, after Carson committed a number of foreign policy gaffes during a radio appearance, Williams roused Bloomberg Politics reporter David Weigel at 7:45 in the morning to offer up an interview with Carson so that Carson could try to clean up the mess. Above all else, Williams is an excellent hype man, constantly talking up Carson to reporters (&quot;This guy is a voracious reader,&quot; he told me) and even suggesting lines of inquiry. &quot;Be sure to ask Dr. Carson about Kanye West,&quot; Williams instructed me. It turns out Carson and the rapper spoke on the phone last year. &quot;He wanted to talk to me and tell me he admired me,&quot; Carson told me. &quot;I was quite impressed with his intelligence.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".281hoqxnnk0.1.1.0.0.4.9">Williams has a deep and abiding faith in Carson&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s that faith, as much as his affinity for this magazine, that likely explains why Williams allowed me so much access to Carson. Williams believes that if reporters just get to know the man he knows, then they will inevitably see the man he sees: a brilliant doctor, a future president, an actual sage. One afternoon, Williams told me about the time last year he took Carson to visit another one of his friends, Maya Angelou, at her North Carolina home. At the end of their visit, Williams said, Angelou invited both men to attend her annual Fourth of July party. Williams knew that Carson had other plans for Independence Day, so, as they were leaving, he teased his friend that he&#x2019;d have to miss Angelou&#x2019;s soiree. Carson replied that Williams would have to miss the party, too. &quot;She reeked of death,&quot; Williams said Carson told him. &quot;She&#x2019;ll be dead in three weeks.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".281hoqxnnk0.1.1.0.0.4.a">Williams continued with the story. &quot;Two weeks and five days later, I was having breakfast at the Monocle when I got a call that Dr. Angelou had died,&quot; Williams told me. I must have looked confused, trying to figure out the import of this anecdote, because Williams hit me in the arm. &quot;Doc was just two days off!&quot; he said.</p></div><div class="grid"
