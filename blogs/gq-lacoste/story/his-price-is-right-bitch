  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterestCarson.gif\u000A\u000ACalling Adam Sandler dumb because he makes dumb movies is as boneheaded as calling Clint Eastwood bloodthirsty because he\u0027s made a bunch of violent ones, but some people never learn. Now that he\u0027s in his second decade of chalking up $100 million theater grosses as dependably as anything in this fickle world except Cher and tas, about the best to be said for the folks who can\u0027t stand Mr. \u0022Nah, I\u0027m just kidding you\u0022 is that they\u0027ve calmed down some.\u000A\u000AThat\u0027s probably healthy, considering how often everything implied about your average American male\u0027s maturity by \u002790s Sandler yukfests like Billy Madison and The Waterboy used to be cited as sulfuric evidence the End Times were near. By and large, his onetime critics don\u0027t dream of seeing their old nemesis\u0027s head on a stick anymore: just on a milk carton, maybe. Sue me for guzzling the milk like J&amp;#xE4;germeister and wondering if Sandler could be the guy we\u0027ll remember for acting out the post-boomer American male\u0027s journey from immaturity to... Well, Mr. Reaper, we don\u0027t know yet, do we?\u000A\u000AAt the very least, too many people still can\u0027t concede how good Sandler has proved to be at not only doing what he does but also finding smart ways to retool his game over time. The standard complaint that he\u0027s not really even an actor went from sounding suspiciously snooty to flat-out stupid as far back as 2002\u0027s Punch-Drunk Love, still P. T. Anderson\u0027s best film and one that\u0027s all but unimaginable without its on-screen MVP\u0027s intimate understanding of the thin line between victimization and paranoia. From where I sit, he could be the most misunderestimated not-really-even-an-actor since Eastwood was plotting how to outlive Dirty Harry\u0027s vogue under our noses.\u000A\u000AFor starters, ponder the title of Sandler\u0027s latest dumb movie, coming everyone\u0027s way like a fart-propelled Twinkie on June 25. Grown Ups, it\u0027s called, and besides co-writing the script, he stars alongside a clutch of SandlerWorld fixtures—Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, Steve Buscemi, etc.—in a story about pubescent cutups reuniting thirty-plus years after their Bob Seger-ized salad days. Especially if you\u0027ve seen the trailer, my predicting that Grown Ups will get rotten reviews and earn a bundle doesn\u0027t exactly make me Nostradamus.\u000A\u000AYet that\u0027s almost beside the point for those of us who\u0027ve learned to admire the canniness masked by Sandler\u0027s beady-eyed indifference to acclaim. Observe how casually the premise repositions this Clinton-era spokesmodel for spiv infantilism by acknowledging that he\u0027s no spring chicken and his buds aren\u0027t either. He\u0027s plainly less freaked-out about turning 44 than his jittery near contemporary Ben Stiller is about turning 45, and let\u0027s not even mention Tom Cruise—still jumpily hawking boyish high spirits just two years from the big 5-0.\u000A\u000ASure, Sandler\u0027s steadfastly (if just barely) PG-13 odes to dudes\u0027 low-minded dilemmas have been outhipped of late by his longtime crony Judd Apatow\u0027s R-rated versions. But Sandler\u0027s secret could be that he\u0027s never had too much invested in hipness for hipness\u0027s sake. Far from being panicked into trying to out-Apatow Apatow—Kevin Smith\u0027s big mistake in the lamentable Zack and Miri Make a Porno—he made a point of symbolically passing the baton by playing the fame-calloused superstar comic showing newbie Seth Rogen the ropes in Apatow\u0027s Funny People last year.\u000A\u000AThough the movie was too woolly-minded for its own good, his performance wasn\u0027t. Unconcerned about coming off attractively, he used his inside knowledge to deliver a portrait of celebrity cynicism and alienation harsh enough to belie the make-nice ending. In another interesting contrast to Ben Stiller, the reason you couldn\u0027t spot the tattletale bits where Sandler was gunning to upgrade his image by scoring an Oscar nod for sensitivity was that there weren\u0027t any.\u000A\u000AImpressive as he can be in more ambitious kinds of movies, Sandler\u0027s day job is concocting vulgarly profitable, more or less feckless commercial comedies. That\u0027s a lesser calling only if you aspire to higher ones, which he apparently doesn\u0027t. One version of good taste he gets no credit for is that he\u0027s never subjected us to his thwarted creative pretensions. That includes trying to direct, something he seems to have zero interest in doing.\u000A\u000AHe clearly doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s too important a job, going by the nonentities who guarantee that no comedy of his will ever have any cinematic interest unrelated to the star\u0027s agenda. Helming his fifth Sandler with Grown Ups, Dennis Dugan isn\u0027t a household name for a reason, just like Steven Brill (two) and Adam\u0027s old NYU pal Frank Coraci (three). At least they\u0027re unobtrusive, unlike Sandler\u0027s fave &amp;#xC2;&amp;#xAD;on-screen foil, the remorselessly untalented Rob Schneider. Also back for Grown Ups, Schneider has been a baffling beneficiary of his patron\u0027s version of welfare since 1998\u0027s The Waterboy.\u000A\u000AAll that just reminds us who\u0027s in charge—and working from distinctly old-fashioned blueprints, too. Sandler doesn\u0027t rely on Hollywood\u0027s current trinity of pop-culture riffng (Apatow\u0027s default mode), far-fetched metamorphoses (Eddie Murphy, we hardly know ye), and CGI-addled showdowns (the Night at the Museum franchise) to get laughs. We know the humdrum but surefire recipe of his average vehicle: another variation on his wiseacre-but-somehow-hobbled persona, a farcical challenge to meet, and a bunch of usual suspects reliably allotted one running gag apiece, from Buscemi turning up in a crazy-eyed crackpot routine to nebbishy Nick Swardson duly impersonating the Pinocchio of sock puppets. Plus a winsome love interest by way of reward, The Longest Yard excepted unless Chris Rock fits the bill.\u000A\u000A The basic ingredients wouldn\u0027t look unfamiliar to an audience from silent-movie days. But it should go without saying that Sandler, who blatantly resorts to stand-ins for any halfway complicated sight gag, doesn\u0027t remotely evoke Harold Lloyd\u0027s or Chaplin\u0027s balletic finesse. He\u0027s just rediscovered the alternately rude and syrupy formulas that made their movies popular.\u000A\u000A Still, formula is as formula does. Within limits—some self-imposed, others nature\u0027s own—Sandler is a shrewd custodian of his own talent. Though some of his movies are more mediocre than others—well, duh—he has very seldom misjudged his appeal. (Exception, at least in my book: 50 First Dates, which is even more unwatchable if you (a) love Drew Barrymore and (b) dug her pairing with Sandler in The Wedding Singer, when he first expanded his brand to romantic comedy.) Politicians would envy his knack for keeping his fan base loyal even as he sneakily evolves.\u000A\u000AWhat else would you call it? Maybe he first endeared himself to America\u0027s real and figurative male adolescents by feeding \u0027em fantasies of immature and/or obnoxious mannish boys turned masters of the universe. But he hasn\u0027t been that guy since he satirized his own rep by playing the Devil\u0027s cretinous son in Little Nicky—not much of a movie, but a great nose-thumb at critics convinced he was Satan\u0027s spawn.\u000A\u000AThat was a decade ago. Never mind that his noncomic changes of pace since then include not only Punch-Drunk Love but the little-seen September 11 requiem Reign Over Me, though he was astounding in both. On his own turf, the former Happy Gilmore has updated a choice piece of Capra-corn (Mr. Deeds) and held his own opposite Jack Nicholson (Anger Management). He\u0027s contemplated mortality (Click). He\u0027s made burlesque but modestly envelope-pushing statements on social issues, both domestic—I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, a.k.a. Brokeback Mountain improved on by The Honeymooners—and international. Calling You Don\u0027t Mess with the Zohan the Borat version of Steven Spielberg\u0027s Munich may not be your idea of a compliment, but point me to the Woody Allen movie that tackles Israel versus Palestine at all.\u000A\u000AThe trick is that Sandler has done this while remaining coarse, reassuringly lowbrow \u0022Adam Sandler\u0022—i.e., never putting the brand at risk. If his fans ever suspected him of artistic growth, the jig would be up.\u000A\u000AOne of Sandler\u0027s virtues is so basic that it\u0027s easily neglected. He isn\u0027t needy—not desperate for our love, not panting after validation. He\u0027s notorious for shunning print interviews, sparing us the Inner Sandler\u0027s neuroses (if any). Compared with Robin Williams\u0027s oxygen-sucking hysteria, thick-skinned calculation with an abrasive streak looks awfully attractive as a career stance.\u000A\u000ABecause treacle is part of the formula, of course Sandler has ladled it out in more than a few movies. He used too big a spoon in Big Daddy, but back then he hadn\u0027t had much practice. More typical is how he solved the problem of playing the impossibly nice guy who learns he\u0027s a fluke billionaire in Mr. Deeds by turning good impulses into a fun-looking form of one-upmanship. Since he may be the New Yorkiest star ever embraced by heartland multiplers—that means he\u0027s way Jewish, folks—the cultural turnabout in play in casting him as the repository of small-town New England values facing down Protocols of the Elders of WASPdom Manhattan sophisticates deserved more ruminating than it got.\u000A\u000AThe way James L. Brooks milked &amp;#xC2;&amp;#xAD;Sandler\u0027s sweet-and-gentle side in 2004\u0027s Spanglish couldn\u0027t salvage that tone-deaf hunk of privileged Left Coast fatuity. But since his 2003 marriage, he\u0027s gotten interested in—and good at—playing affectionate husbands and fathers, a side of the human condition that Sean Penn\u0027s CV, for instance, gives short shrift. Also at sketching professions for the camera, the reason some of his best moments in Spanglish were the quick glimpses we got of a budding celebrity chef\u0027s ambitions and fatigue.\u000A\u000AEven so, Sandler has been most original in roles that let him take the childish selfishness and aggression the kiddies always dug him for to volatile, painful adult extremes. As the deranged widower in Reign Over Me, he left an actor as expert as Don Cheadle straining to catch up; his outbursts of rage and confusion were so unpremeditated that they seemed to catch even him unawares. Even in an ostensible comedy like 2006\u0027s Click—released the year Sandler turned 40 and one of the darkest of Hollywood\u0027s gazillion informal remakes of It\u0027s a Wonderful Life—his acting in the scenes where the fast-forwarding hero reaches his barren final years was remarkable. Here was a convincingly burdened, spookily Michael Corleone-ish anticipation of something most of us can\u0027t begin to imagine yet: Adam Sandler in old age.\u000A\u000ARemember, this was the braying schmuck who wasn\u0027t supposed to grow up at all. But take his dumb movies in order—then throw in his smart ones, too—and ask yourself who\u0027s surfed the Zeitgeist better, from personifying the slob pleasures of the Clinton years\u0027 nationwide regression to adolescence to being devastated by September 11 to accepting midlife\u0027s slob responsibilities as he lets Seth Rogen\u0027s generation take over his former turf. Sean Penn\u0027s filmography doesn\u0027t tell a story half as good—and if Sandler will never have Penn\u0027s lofty rep, Penn will never have Sandler\u0027s connection with the public. Which one better defines the American male\u0027s ups and downs in our strange times?\u000A\u000AIn real life, Sandler seems utterly confident that he\u0027ll still be delivering the goods to gratified ticket buyers in President Chelsea Clinton\u0027s second term. If he\u0027s right about that, don\u0027t blame me for looking forward to the indignant reactions from my fellow codgers in the Old Critics\u0027 Home when he starts collecting lifetime-achievement awards. But given one obvious precedent, let me set America\u0027s mind at ease. So far as I can tell, the French don\u0027t like him a bit.",

Clint Eastwood bloodthirsty because he&#x2019;s made a bunch of violent ones, but some people never learn. Now that he&#x2019;s in his second decade of chalking up $100 million theater grosses as dependably as anything in this fickle world except Cher and tas, about the best to be said for the folks who can&#x2019;t stand Mr. &quot;Nah, I&#x2019;m just kidding you&quot; is that they&#x2019;ve calmed down some.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.5">That&#x2019;s probably healthy, considering how often everything implied about your average American male&#x2019;s maturity by &#x2019;90s Sandler yukfests like <em>Billy Madison</em> and <em>The Waterboy</em> used to be cited as sulfuric evidence the End Times were near. By and large, his onetime critics don&#x2019;t dream of seeing their old nemesis&#x2019;s head on a stick anymore: just on a milk carton, maybe. Sue me for guzzling the milk like J&amp;#xE4;germeister and wondering if Sandler could be the guy we&#x2019;ll remember for acting out the post-boomer American male&#x2019;s journey from immaturity to... Well, Mr. Reaper, we don&#x2019;t know yet, do we?</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.6">At the very least, too many people still can&#x2019;t concede how good Sandler has proved to be at not only doing what he does but also finding smart ways to retool his game over time. The standard complaint that he&#x2019;s not really even an actor went from sounding suspiciously snooty to flat-out stupid as far back as 2002&#x2019;s <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>, still P. T. Anderson&#x2019;s best film and one that&#x2019;s all but unimaginable without its on-screen MVP&#x2019;s intimate understanding of the thin line between victimization and paranoia. From where I sit, he could be the most misunderestimated not-really-even-an-actor since Eastwood was plotting how to outlive <em>Dirty Harry</em>&#x2019;s vogue under our noses.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.7">For starters, ponder the title of Sandler&#x2019;s latest dumb movie, coming everyone&#x2019;s way like a fart-propelled Twinkie on June 25. <em>Grown Ups</em>, it&#x2019;s called, and besides co-writing the script, he stars alongside a clutch of SandlerWorld fixtures&#x2014;Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, Steve Buscemi, etc.&#x2014;in a story about pubescent cutups reuniting thirty-plus years after their Bob Seger-ized salad days. Especially if you&#x2019;ve seen the trailer, my predicting that <em>Grown Ups</em> will get rotten reviews and earn a bundle doesn&#x2019;t exactly make me Nostradamus.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.8">Yet that&#x2019;s almost beside the point for those of us who&#x2019;ve learned to admire the canniness masked by Sandler&#x2019;s beady-eyed indifference to acclaim. Observe how casually the premise repositions this Clinton-era spokesmodel for spiv infantilism by acknowledging that he&#x2019;s no spring chicken and his buds aren&#x2019;t either. He&#x2019;s plainly less freaked-out about turning 44 than his jittery near contemporary Ben Stiller is about turning 45, and let&#x2019;s not even mention Tom Cruise&#x2014;still jumpily hawking boyish high spirits just two years from the big 5-0.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.9">Sure, Sandler&#x2019;s steadfastly (if just barely) PG-13 odes to dudes&#x2019; low-minded dilemmas have been outhipped of late by his longtime crony Judd Apatow&#x2019;s R-rated versions. But Sandler&#x2019;s secret could be that he&#x2019;s never had too much invested in hipness for hipness&#x2019;s sake. Far from being panicked into trying to out-Apatow Apatow&#x2014;Kevin Smith&#x2019;s big mistake in the lamentable <em>Zack and Miri Make a Porno</em>&#x2014;he made a point of symbolically passing the baton by playing the fame-calloused superstar comic showing newbie Seth Rogen the ropes in Apatow&#x2019;s <em>Funny People</em> last year.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.a">Though the movie was too woolly-minded for its own good, his performance wasn&#x2019;t. Unconcerned about coming off attractively, he used his inside knowledge to deliver a portrait of celebrity cynicism and alienation harsh enough to belie the make-nice ending. In another interesting contrast to Ben Stiller, the reason you couldn&#x2019;t spot the tattletale bits where Sandler was gunning to upgrade his image by scoring an Oscar nod for sensitivity was that there weren&#x2019;t any.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.b">Impressive as he can be in more ambitious kinds of movies, Sandler&#x2019;s day job is concocting vulgarly profitable, more or less feckless commercial comedies. That&#x2019;s a lesser calling only if you aspire to higher ones, which he apparently doesn&#x2019;t. One version of good taste he gets no credit for is that he&#x2019;s never subjected us to his thwarted creative pretensions. That includes trying to direct, something he seems to have zero interest in doing.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.c">He clearly doesn&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s too important a job, going by the nonentities who guarantee that no comedy of his will ever have any cinematic interest unrelated to the star&#x2019;s agenda. Helming his fifth Sandler with <em>Grown Ups</em>, Dennis Dugan isn&#x2019;t a household name for a reason, just like Steven Brill (two) and Adam&#x2019;s old NYU pal Frank Coraci (three). At least they&#x2019;re unobtrusive, unlike Sandler&#x2019;s fave &amp;#xC2;&amp;#xAD;on-screen foil, the remorselessly untalented Rob Schneider. Also back for <em>Grown Ups</em>, Schneider has been a baffling beneficiary of his patron&#x2019;s version of welfare since 1998&#x2019;s <em>The Waterboy</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.d">All that just reminds us who&#x2019;s in charge&#x2014;and working from distinctly old-fashioned blueprints, too. Sandler doesn&#x2019;t rely on Hollywood&#x2019;s current trinity of pop-culture riffng (Apatow&#x2019;s default mode), far-fetched metamorphoses (Eddie Murphy, we hardly know ye), and CGI-addled showdowns (the <em>Night at the Museum</em> franchise) to get laughs. We know the humdrum but surefire recipe of his average vehicle: another variation on his wiseacre-but-somehow-hobbled persona, a farcical challenge to meet, and a bunch of usual suspects reliably allotted one running gag apiece, from Buscemi turning up in a crazy-eyed crackpot routine to nebbishy Nick Swardson duly impersonating the Pinocchio of sock puppets. Plus a winsome love interest by way of reward, <em>The Longest Yard</em> excepted unless Chris Rock fits the bill.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.e"> The basic ingredients wouldn&#x2019;t look unfamiliar to an audience from silent-movie days. But it should go without saying that Sandler, who blatantly resorts to stand-ins for any halfway complicated sight gag, doesn&#x2019;t remotely evoke Harold Lloyd&#x2019;s or Chaplin&#x2019;s balletic finesse. He&#x2019;s just rediscovered the alternately rude and syrupy formulas that made their movies popular.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.f"> Still, formula is as formula does. Within limits&#x2014;some self-imposed, others nature&#x2019;s own&#x2014;Sandler is a shrewd custodian of his own talent. Though some of his movies are more mediocre than others&#x2014;well, duh&#x2014;he has very seldom misjudged his appeal. (Exception, at least in my book: <em>50 First Dates</em>, which is even more unwatchable if you (a) love Drew Barrymore and (b) dug her pairing with Sandler in <em>The Wedding Singer</em>, when he first expanded his brand to romantic comedy.) Politicians would envy his knack for keeping his fan base loyal even as he sneakily evolves.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.g">What else would you call it? Maybe he first endeared himself to America&#x2019;s real and figurative male adolescents by feeding &#x2019;em fantasies of immature and/or obnoxious mannish boys turned masters of the universe. But he hasn&#x2019;t been that guy since he satirized his own rep by playing the Devil&#x2019;s cretinous son in <em>Little Nicky</em>&#x2014;not much of a movie, but a great nose-thumb at critics convinced he was Satan&#x2019;s spawn.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.h">That was a decade ago. Never mind that his noncomic changes of pace since then include not only <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em> but the little-seen September 11 requiem <em>Reign Over Me</em>, though he was astounding in both. On his own turf, the former Happy Gilmore has updated a choice piece of Capra-corn (<em>Mr. Deeds</em>) and held his own opposite Jack Nicholson (<em>Anger Management</em>). He&#x2019;s contemplated mortality (<em>Click</em>). He&#x2019;s made burlesque but modestly envelope-pushing statements on social issues, both domestic&#x2014;<em>I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry</em>, a.k.a. <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> improved on by <em>The Honeymooners</em>&#x2014;and international. Calling <em>You Don&#x2019;t Mess with the Zohan</em> the <em>Borat</em> version of Steven Spielberg&#x2019;s <em>Munich</em> may not be your idea of a compliment, but point me to the Woody Allen movie that tackles Israel versus Palestine at all.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.i">The trick is that Sandler has done this while remaining coarse, reassuringly lowbrow &quot;Adam Sandler&quot;&#x2014;i.e., never putting the brand at risk. If his fans ever suspected him of artistic growth, the jig would be up.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.j">One of Sandler&#x2019;s virtues is so basic that it&#x2019;s easily neglected. He isn&#x2019;t <em>needy</em>&#x2014;not desperate for our love, not panting after validation. He&#x2019;s notorious for shunning print interviews, sparing us the Inner Sandler&#x2019;s neuroses (if any). Compared with Robin Williams&#x2019;s oxygen-sucking hysteria, thick-skinned calculation with an abrasive streak looks awfully attractive as a career stance.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.k">Because treacle is part of the formula, of course Sandler has ladled it out in more than a few movies. He used too big a spoon in <em>Big Daddy</em>, but back then he hadn&#x2019;t had much practice. More typical is how he solved the problem of playing the impossibly nice guy who learns he&#x2019;s a fluke billionaire in <em>Mr. Deeds</em> by turning good impulses into a fun-looking form of one-upmanship. Since he may be the New Yorkiest star ever embraced by heartland multiplers&#x2014;that means he&#x2019;s <em>way</em> Jewish, folks&#x2014;the cultural turnabout in play in casting him as the repository of small-town New England values facing down <em>Protocols of the Elders of WASPdom</em> Manhattan sophisticates deserved more ruminating than it got.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.l">The way James L. Brooks milked &amp;#xC2;&amp;#xAD;Sandler&#x2019;s sweet-and-gentle side in 2004&#x2019;s <em>Spanglish</em> couldn&#x2019;t salvage that tone-deaf hunk of privileged Left Coast fatuity. But since his 2003 marriage, he&#x2019;s gotten interested in&#x2014;and good at&#x2014;playing affectionate husbands and fathers, a side of the human condition that Sean Penn&#x2019;s CV, for instance, gives short shrift. Also at sketching professions for the camera, the reason some of his best moments in <em>Spanglish</em> were the quick glimpses we got of a budding celebrity chef&#x2019;s ambitions and fatigue.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.m">Even so, Sandler has been most original in roles that let him take the childish selfishness and aggression the kiddies always dug him for to volatile, painful adult extremes. As the deranged widower in <em>Reign Over Me</em>, he left an actor as expert as Don Cheadle straining to catch up; his outbursts of rage and confusion were so unpremeditated that they seemed to catch even him unawares. Even in an ostensible comedy like 2006&#x2019;s <em>Click</em>&#x2014;released the year Sandler turned 40 and one of the darkest of Hollywood&#x2019;s gazillion informal remakes of <em>It&#x2019;s a Wonderful Life</em>&#x2014;his acting in the scenes where the fast-forwarding hero reaches his barren final years was remarkable. Here was a convincingly burdened, spookily Michael Corleone-ish anticipation of something most of us can&#x2019;t begin to imagine yet: Adam Sandler in old age.</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.n">Remember, this was the braying schmuck who wasn&#x2019;t supposed to grow up at all. But take his dumb movies in order&#x2014;then throw in his smart ones, too&#x2014;and ask yourself who&#x2019;s surfed the Zeitgeist better, from personifying the slob pleasures of the Clinton years&#x2019; nationwide regression to adolescence to being devastated by September 11 to accepting midlife&#x2019;s slob responsibilities as he lets Seth Rogen&#x2019;s generation take over his former turf. Sean Penn&#x2019;s filmography doesn&#x2019;t tell a story half as good&#x2014;and if Sandler will never have Penn&#x2019;s lofty rep, Penn will never have Sandler&#x2019;s connection with the public. Which one better defines the American male&#x2019;s ups and downs in our strange times?</p><p data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.4.o">In real life, Sandler seems utterly confident that he&#x2019;ll still be delivering the goods to gratified ticket buyers in President Chelsea Clinton&#x2019;s second term. If he&#x2019;s right about that, don&#x2019;t blame me for looking forward to the indignant reactions from my fellow codgers in the Old Critics&#x2019; Home when he starts collecting lifetime-achievement awards. But given one obvious precedent, let me set America&#x2019;s mind at ease. So far as I can tell, the French don&#x2019;t like him a bit.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".shw4c7arcw.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col
