  	    "articleBody": "A few weeks ago in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, researchers at Stanford\u0027s Graduate School of Business published an article that adds a new layer to the increasingly messy and frustrating national conversation about race in the United States. Specifically, white Americans get cagey when they have to talk about it.\u000A\u000ABrian Lowery, professor of organizational behavior, and his student L. Taylor Phillips gave white respondents identical surveys to fill out. Half of those surveys had a brief preamble about white privilege in the U.S., while the other half did not. Survey-takers who read the preamble were more likely to discuss personal hardship and suffering in their answers, which is oddly fascinating but also...kinda obvious? So we reached out to Lowery to ask him about it.\u000A\u000AGQ: In the article, you describe this reaction as a \u0022defense of self.\u0022 Can you talk a little bit about that?Brian Lowery: Generally, people like to have a positive view of themselves. You want to think that you\u0027re a virtuous, nice person, and in our society being successful is connected to the idea that you\u0027re a good person because you worked hard, you\u0027re smart, and you deserve the stuff that you have. The desire to feel like you are a good person is predicated a bit on the belief that you earned the good things that have happened to you. So if we tell people, ‘Some of the good things that have happened to you were not earned,\u0027 I think that challenges people\u0027s positive sense of themselves and makes them defensive. \u000A\u000AThis reminds me of the concept of \u0022white fragility,\u0022 the notion that white people—this writer included—can\u0027t handle a frank conversation about race or racism because it\u0027s so hostile to their sense of who they are.I think that in this country race is a very sensitive subject for most people, but for white people in particular, for a variety of reasons. The effects and the function of race are clear, independent of where we come from. I don\u0027t think there are any doubts about that. The question becomes, What do you think about that, or what do you make of that? And the first thing you see is that white people don\u0027t want to talk about it at all. That\u0027s not a comfortable conversation to be having. And the question becomes, why? \u000A\u000APrivilege is not ease all of your life or being rich. I think that people have a hard time getting their heads around that.Twitter\u000A\u000A\u0022Fragility\u0022 implies some kind of psychological fragility, and I think there is some of that, but there are multiple reasons why white people might feel uncomfortable discussing race. Another possibility is that you have a desire to maintain those privileges. It could be subconscious, but if you know that you benefit from your race, it might occur to you it\u0027s not in your best interest to talk about them.\u000A\u000AHave you gotten a lot of negative reaction yet?A little bit, in social media, but I don\u0027t pay any attention to it. I\u0027ve gotten a couple e-mails, and they\u0027re often funny because they provide more evidence of what the article says than anything else. They say, \u0022My life was so hard, I didn\u0027t have any advantages, white privilege doesn\u0027t even exist.\u0022 And their evidence for its nonexistence is the fact that they suffered in their lives, which is exactly what the article is about. \u000A\u000ASo they\u0027re kind of proving the point.And sometimes you get the other side, where people say, \u0022I know some black people who benefitted from affirmative action.\u0022 That can be true, and what the article says can still be true—they\u0027re not incompatible. I think some of that is because people have a hard time understanding systematic effects. They\u0027re used to thinking in anecdotes and that individual stories are on the same level as what we\u0027re describing, and it\u0027s not. \u000A\u000AAnd so the respondents in your survey were using hardships as a way to anecdotally prove privilege isn\u0027t real?When people claim to have hardships, to be clear, they really are hardships. We\u0027re not saying they\u0027re made up; these are legitimate hardships. We\u0027re not denying that whites or any individuals have a hard life. The point we really make is, What if you were black and had those same hardships? Privilege is not ease all of your life or being rich. I think that people have a hard time getting their heads around that. \u000A\u000AThere\u0027s more and more research coming out that shows that when you present people with evidence that challenges their ideas, they just double down on what they already believed. Do you think this article will change any minds?That\u0027s something I think about quite a bit, actually. A lot of research in this area tends to end up preaching to the choir. There\u0027s plenty of evidence that people don\u0027t change their minds in response to evidence. They look for things that are consistent with what they already believe. I think that changing minds requires changing the broad narrative. It\u0027s not about getting people to switch from one position in a debate to another. It\u0027s changing the debate.",

data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.3">Meet Brian Lowery, the psychology researcher whose recent study found that white folks are more likely to bring up personal hardships when presented with the concept of privilege</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.4.0">A few weeks ago in the <em>Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em>, researchers at Stanford&#x2019;s Graduate School of Business published <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103115000852">an article</a> that adds a new layer to the increasingly <a href="shaun-king-interview-breitbart-black-lives-matter">messy</a> and <a href="http://www.gq.com/story/ferguson-post-race-fallacy">frustrating</a> national conversation about race in the United States. Specifically, white Americans get cagey when they have to talk about it.</p><p data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.4.1">Brian Lowery, professor of organizational behavior, and his student L. Taylor Phillips gave white respondents identical surveys to fill out. Half of those surveys had a brief preamble about white privilege in the U.S., while the other half did not. Survey-takers who read the preamble were more likely to discuss personal hardship and suffering in their answers, which is oddly fascinating but also...<a href="http://nypost.com/2015/09/30/white-people-reject-claims-of-white-privilege-study-finds/">kinda obvious</a>? So we reached out to Lowery to ask him about it.</p><p data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>GQ: In the article, you describe this reaction as a &#x201C;defense of self.&#x201D; Can you talk a little bit about that?</strong><br><strong>Brian Lowery:</strong> Generally, people like to have a positive view of themselves. You want to think that you&#x2019;re a virtuous, nice person, and in our society being successful is connected to the idea that you&#x2019;re a good person because you worked hard, you&#x2019;re smart, and you deserve the stuff that you have. The desire to feel like you are a good person is predicated a bit on the belief that you earned the good things that have happened to you. So if we tell people, &#x2018;Some of the good things that have happened to you were not earned,&#x2019; I think that challenges people&#x2019;s positive sense of themselves and makes them defensive. </p><p data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.4.3"><strong>This reminds me of the concept of &#x201C;white fragility,&#x201D; the notion that white people&#x2014;this writer included&#x2014;can&#x2019;t handle a frank conversation about race or racism because it&#x2019;s so hostile to their sense of who they are.</strong><br>I think that in this country race is a very sensitive subject for most people, but for white people in particular, for a variety of reasons. The effects and the function of race are clear, independent of where we come from. I don&#x2019;t think there are any doubts about that. The question becomes, What do you think about that, or what do you make of that? And the first thing you see is that white people don&#x2019;t want to talk about it at all. That&#x2019;s not a comfortable conversation to be having. And the question becomes, why? </p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.4.5"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>Privilege is not ease all of your life or being rich. I think that people have a hard time getting their heads around that.</p></blockquote></span><div class="pullquote-share twitter"><a class="pullquote-share-icon" href="https://twitter.com/share?via=GQ&amp;text=%22Privilege%20is%20not%20ease%20all%20of%20your%20life%20or%20being%20rich.%20I%20think%20that%20people%20have%20a%20hard%20time%20getting%20their%20heads%20around%20that.%22" target="_blank" title="Share on Twitter"><span class="label">Twitter</span></a></div></div></div></div><p data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.4.6">&#x201C;Fragility&#x201D; implies some kind of psychological fragility, and I think there is some of that, but there are multiple reasons why white people might feel uncomfortable discussing race. Another possibility is that you have a desire to maintain those privileges. It could be subconscious, but if you know that you benefit from your race, it might occur to you it&#x2019;s not in your best interest to talk about them.</p><p data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.4.7"><strong>Have you gotten a lot of negative reaction yet?</strong><br>A little bit, in social media, but I don&#x2019;t pay any attention to it. I&#x2019;ve gotten a couple e-mails, and they&#x2019;re often funny because they provide more evidence of what the article says than anything else. They say, &#x201C;My life was so hard, I didn&#x2019;t have any advantages, white privilege doesn&#x2019;t even exist.&#x201D; And their evidence for its nonexistence is the fact that they suffered in their lives, which is exactly what the article is about. </p><p data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>So they&#x2019;re kind of proving the point.</strong><br>And sometimes you get the other side, where people say, &#x201C;I know some black people who benefitted from affirmative action.&#x201D; That can be true, and what the article says can still be true&#x2014;they&#x2019;re not incompatible. I think some of that is because people have a hard time understanding systematic effects. They&#x2019;re used to thinking in anecdotes and that individual stories are on the same level as what we&#x2019;re describing, and it&#x2019;s not. </p><p data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>And so the respondents in your survey were using hardships as a way to anecdotally prove privilege isn&#x2019;t real?</strong><br>When people claim to have hardships, to be clear, they really are hardships. We&#x2019;re not saying they&#x2019;re made up; these are legitimate hardships. We&#x2019;re not denying that whites or any individuals have a hard life. The point we really make is, What if you were black and had those same hardships? Privilege is not ease all of your life or being rich. I think that people have a hard time getting their heads around that. </p><p data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>There&#x2019;s more and more research coming out that shows that when you present people with evidence that challenges their ideas, they just double down on what they already believed. Do you think this article will change any minds?</strong><br>That&#x2019;s something I think about quite a bit, actually. A lot of research in this area tends to end up preaching to the choir. There&#x2019;s plenty of evidence that people don&#x2019;t change their minds in response to evidence. They look for things that are consistent with what they already believe. I think that changing minds requires changing the broad narrative. It&#x2019;s not about getting people to switch from one position in a debate to another. It&#x2019;s changing the debate.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".15a1kfr435s.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
