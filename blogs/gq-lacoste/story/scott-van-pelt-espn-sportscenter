  	    "articleBody": "Dah-duh-dah, dah-duh-dah. Since it debuted in 1979, ESPN\u0027s SportsCenter has been the program many of us have looked to for scores and highlights of the day\u0027s big games. But ESPN recently debuted a midnight edition of SportsCenter that feels more like a late-night talk show, with a solo host and with more guests and commentary. \u000A\u000AThe man behind the mood-lit desk is Scott Van Pelt, a longtime TV anchor and radio host for ESPN with an ability to bring sky-not-falling interpretations to the sports world\u0027s storylines. The new show lets Van Pelt follow his whims for TV like he did for radio: In the first couple weeks, he provided multi-day analysis of a rabbit\u0027s leaping ability and brought Tim Kurkjian, an ESPN baseball analyst and Van Pelt\u0027s fellow Maryland native, to the set mostly so Kurkjian could wheeze in hysteria over Van Pelt\u0027s embellished Baltimore accent. \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s a good time. We caught up with Van Pelt to chat about his new spin on the classic show.  \u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: Who came to you with the idea of SportsCenter as more of a talk show? How did the first chat about the concept go?Scott Van Pelt: There\u0027s a guy there by the name of Mike McQuade who is probably one of the most respected people at ESPN in terms of actual production. We were at the Masters one year, at this house we stay in every year, and we were watching Olbermann. I said to him, apropos of nothing, \u0022You know, this would be an interesting show to do, where you can kind of do what you want. That would interest me, but you could never do that on SportsCenter.\u0022 \u000A\u000AHis answer was, \u0022Why not?\u0022 and I thought, \u0022Well, because that\u0027s not what they\u0027ve ever done.\u0022 He said, \u0022Why couldn\u0027t you?\u0022 I said, \u0022Well you could, but I couldn\u0027t. Someone would have to greenlight it.\u0022 From that conversation until this actually happened was several years. But it all started with that conversation, watching Olbermann.\u000A\u000AEveryone knows the hook to the music. Everyone knows what to expect from the show. It\u0027s sturdy, and sturdy becomes sacrosanct. When you\u0027re changing that type of show, how do you know what\u0027s too much and what\u0027s not enough?This is still SportsCenter, but we\u0027re clearly creating room to do things with a radio feel in the sense that there\u0027s commentary. \u0022The One Big Thing\u0022 is a segment I was doing every day on radio, focusing on this one topic that I\u0027m wanting to delve into very specifically. There was a blogger from Australia who became something of a phenomenon Monday. Everyone was enjoying him. We called him up Tuesday; he was on SportsCenter for five minutes. \u000A\u000AI don\u0027t know what we didn\u0027t show as a result of talking to him, but I enjoyed talking to him. \u000A\u000A\u0022Embrace debate\u0022 has been a mantra at ESPN. The network has a few guys with hot takesâ€”guys who, over time, digress into caricatures of themselves. You don\u0027t do the vitriol and dogma act. Is your stage a way for ESPN to mitigate its sports-yelling era?[Laughs] That\u0027s a very well-crafted question that asks me about one specific show and two specific hosts, is it not?\u000A\u000AOne show might be emblematic of the mantra, but it\u0027s not the only show in question.I can\u0027t speak for anyone and their approach to anything, other than that it isn\u0027t mine. I think if people take a show and certain hosts\u0027 approach as speaking for all of us, that\u0027s a mistake, because it certainly doesn\u0027t. I\u0027m obviously thrilled that management did what they did for me, and I think I pay them back by trying to do a smart show that has some fun along the way.\u000A\u000ATwenty years ago, we needed a TV show to get scores and highlights. Now we don\u0027t have to wait for a show and its fixed time slot. What\u0027s the best purpose for highlight packages today?There\u0027s no denying the role it plays has changed since the time Dan [Patrick] and Keith [Olbermann], among others, were on. You don\u0027t need to watch to find out. The moment of revelation is gone. But I think people still have an appetite to see something they\u0027ve already seen, if it\u0027s particularly interesting.\u000A\u000AThe other day, in the Monday night game, the Falcons\u0027 second touchdown came after an iffy penalty call. We showed the play that would\u0027ve given Philly the ball, and I think that\u0027s just a bit more nuanced in the ultimate telling of that story. \u0022The Falcons scored to go up 20-3, but this is the call that allowed them to keep the ball, and it\u0027s kind of dodgy.\u0022 We\u0027re telling the story with more layers. We have a great group of fans on staff who watch with an eye for that. You\u0027re always going to show the great plays, but can you also tell the plays that are part of the story?\u000A\u000A\u0022People get so excited when Al Michaels or Brent Musburger make thinly veiled references to the line. But for us, this isn\u0027t the elephant in the room. We\u0027re having shots with the elephant in the room.\u0022Twitter\u000A\u000AYou go on right after Monday Night Football. It seems difficult to make those storytelling decisions, to choose your lens, in that time. How do those talks go with your staff? We have a room, a conference room in the new digital center. We\u0027re just in there as a group, watching things play out. Right after that touchdown, it was either me or one of our main highlight guys, Ken Barkley, who said, \u0022Man, that penalty on [Kiko] Alonso was a big deal. That was iffy. They should\u0027ve had the ball.\u0022 As that\u0027s happening, we\u0027re saying that\u0027s something that ought to be in the highlights. \u000A\u000AAs the bigger games are going on, we\u0027re watching with that lens. What can we illuminate here? Obviously we can\u0027t do that with every game; we can\u0027t watch with twenty eyeballs on it. But with games we\u0027re giving the bigger highlight treatment, that\u0027s the goal.\u000A\u000AYour show has a couple of segments, \u0022Winners\u0022 and \u0022Bad Beats,\u0022 about the gambling spread. Sports has a short-term stock market, full stop. Do you think we\u0027re done talking around it? Yes. People still get so excited when Al Michaels or Brent Musburger make this thinly veiled reference to the line. You get the idea they\u0027re jumping up and down going, \u0022They talked about the spread! They talked about the spread!\u0022 Well we\u0027re going to talk about it like adults and say, \u0022Boy, if you had the under in the BYU game, that was awful, and we\u0027ll show you how.\u0022 This isn\u0027t the elephant in the room. We\u0027re sitting down and having shots with the elephant in the room. \u000A\u000AThe climate is such that everyone recognizes it\u0027s always been done. The conversations going on right now are about FanDuel and DraftKings, whether or not that\u0027s gambling. I\u0027m sorry, but it is, man. If you\u0027re putting money into accounts, you\u0027re going to head-to-head with people, and you\u0027re winning or losing money based on the outcomes of games, then you\u0027re betting on sports. I think three out of every four ads this weekend was for it. \u000A\u000AI\u0027m just talking about guys who are getting three and a half or giving three and a half, and the bosses are obviously letting me do it. We\u0027re addressing what I perceive to be a decent chunk of our audience that\u0027s familiar with getting or giving points.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s the beat you\u0027ve experienced or heard about?That\u0027s why the segment has a beauty to itâ€”because every time you think you\u0027ve seen it, something more horrendous comes around the corner. \u000A\u000AI think the Belk Bowl has come to represent that worst beat anyone ever remembers. The CliffsNotes are this: Duke was getting about nine points and they were about the score with a minute or so left in a tie game. They fumbled on the five-yard line, then Cincinnati scored on about an 85-yard touchdown. So it\u0027s still in the final minute, and Duke has the ball, and then there\u0027s a pick-six on basically the last play of the game. \u000A\u000ASo you had a nine-point underdog getting ready to score. They\u0027re maybe going to win the game, and they\u0027re definitely going to cover. But the fumble, the touchdown, the pick-sixâ€”it all happened in a span of five minutes, real time, in a bowl game everyone watched during the holiday season. Say \u0022Belk Bowl\u0022 to anyone who bets, and see if you don\u0027t get a reaction.\u000A\u000AYou always seem composed and self-assured. Does a new gigâ€”a very personality-driven gigâ€”dig up new self-consciousness about the need to be smart or funny for your audience?All you can try to be is who you are. I think I\u0027m self-aware, if nothing else. I know I\u0027m not the smartest guy, not the most educated fan. There are fans who are going to know more than me. You can\u0027t try too hard to be funny. I think you learn what you find funny, and your audience is either going to be with you or they\u0027re not. I think my bosses put me out there because they trust me and my instincts to be who I am. You just have to believe that\u0027s enough.\u000A\u000AIf you really stopped and thought, here\u0027s this SportsCenter and they\u0027re giving you an hour, that could be paralyzing, man. Like, Jesus, how do I do this? Well, they didn\u0027t put you out here to be something more than you are, so just go do what you do. You have to know it won\u0027t be for everyone. There will people who will say, \u0022I can\u0027t stand this asshole.\u0022 Well, I\u0027m sorry. There will be others who will say, \u0022We enjoy this. We\u0027ll watch.\u0022",

Since it debuted in 1979, ESPN&#x2019;s <em>SportsCenter</em> has been the program many of us have looked to for scores and highlights of the day&#x2019;s big games. But ESPN recently debuted a midnight edition of <em>SportsCenter</em> that feels more like a late-night talk show, with a solo host and with more guests and commentary. </p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.1">The man behind the mood-lit desk is Scott Van Pelt, a longtime TV anchor and radio host for ESPN with an ability to bring sky-not-falling interpretations to the sports world&#x2019;s storylines. The new show lets Van Pelt follow his whims for TV like he did for radio: In the first couple weeks, he provided multi-day analysis of a rabbit&#x2019;s leaping ability and brought Tim Kurkjian, an ESPN baseball analyst and Van Pelt&#x2019;s fellow Maryland native, to the set mostly so Kurkjian could wheeze in hysteria over Van Pelt&#x2019;s embellished Baltimore accent. </p><div class="embed figure" data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.2"><figure class="embedded-video"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vy37V2rYSZU" height="" width=""></iframe></figure></div><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.3">It&#x2019;s a good time. We caught up with Van Pelt to chat about his new spin on the classic show.  </p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.5"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong><em>GQ</em>: Who came to you with the idea of <em>SportsCenter</em> as more of a talk show? How did the first chat about the concept go?</strong><br><strong>Scott Van Pelt:</strong> There&#x2019;s a guy there by the name of Mike McQuade who is probably one of the most respected people at ESPN in terms of actual production. We were at the Masters one year, at this house we stay in every year, and we were watching <em>Olbermann</em>. I said to him, apropos of nothing, &#x201C;You know, this would be an interesting show to do, where you can kind of do what you want. That would interest me, but you could never do that on <em>SportsCenter</em>.&#x201D; </p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.7">His answer was, &#x201C;Why not?&#x201D; and I thought, &#x201C;Well, because that&#x2019;s not what they&#x2019;ve ever done.&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;Why couldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;Well you could, but <em>I</em> couldn&#x2019;t. Someone would have to greenlight it.&#x201D; From that conversation until this actually happened was several years. But it all started with that conversation, watching <em>Olbermann</em>.</p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.8"><strong>Everyone knows the hook to the music. Everyone knows what to expect from the show. It&#x2019;s sturdy, and sturdy becomes sacrosanct. When you&#x2019;re changing that type of show, how do you know what&#x2019;s too much and what&#x2019;s not enough?</strong><br>This is still <em>SportsCenter</em>, but we&#x2019;re clearly creating room to do things with a radio feel in the sense that there&#x2019;s commentary. &#x201C;The One Big Thing&#x201D; is a segment I was doing every day on radio, focusing on this one topic that I&#x2019;m wanting to delve into very specifically. There was a blogger from Australia who became something of a phenomenon Monday. Everyone was enjoying him. We called him up Tuesday; he was on <em>SportsCenter</em> for five minutes. </p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.9">I don&#x2019;t know what we didn&#x2019;t show as a result of talking to him, but I enjoyed talking to him. </p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.a"><strong>&#x201C;Embrace debate&#x201D; has been a mantra at ESPN. The network has a few guys with hot takes&#x2014;guys who, over time, digress into caricatures of themselves. You don&#x2019;t do the vitriol and dogma act. Is your stage a way for ESPN to mitigate its sports-yelling era?</strong><br>[<em>Laughs</em>] That&#x2019;s a very well-crafted question that asks me about one specific show and two specific hosts, is it not?</p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>One show might be emblematic of the mantra, but it&#x2019;s not the only show in question.</strong><br>I can&#x2019;t speak for anyone and their approach to anything, other than that it isn&#x2019;t mine. I think if people take a show and certain hosts&#x2019; approach as speaking for all of us, that&#x2019;s a mistake, because it certainly doesn&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m obviously thrilled that management did what they did for me, and I think I pay them back by trying to do a smart show that has some fun along the way.</p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.c"><strong>Twenty years ago, we needed a TV show to get scores and highlights. Now we don&#x2019;t have to wait for a show and its fixed time slot. What&#x2019;s the best purpose for highlight packages today?</strong><br>There&#x2019;s no denying the role it plays has changed since the time Dan [Patrick] and Keith [Olbermann], among others, were on. You don&#x2019;t need to watch to find out. The moment of revelation is gone. But I think people still have an appetite to see something they&#x2019;ve already seen, if it&#x2019;s particularly interesting.</p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.d">The other day, in the Monday night game, the Falcons&#x2019; second touchdown came after an iffy penalty call. We showed the play that would&#x2019;ve given Philly the ball, and I think that&#x2019;s just a bit more nuanced in the ultimate telling of that story. &#x201C;The Falcons scored to go up 20-3, but this is the call that allowed them to keep the ball, and it&#x2019;s kind of dodgy.&#x201D; We&#x2019;re telling the story with more layers. We have a great group of fans on staff who watch with an eye for that. You&#x2019;re always going to show the great plays, but can you also tell the plays that are part of the story?</p><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.e"><div class="callout small" data-type="callout"><div class="embed pullquote" data-type="pullquote"><span><blockquote><p>&quot;People get so excited when Al Michaels or Brent Musburger make thinly veiled references to the line.

It seems difficult to make those storytelling decisions, to choose your lens, in that time. How do those talks go with your staff?</strong> <br>We have a room, a conference room in the new digital center. We&#x2019;re just in there as a group, watching things play out. Right after that touchdown, it was either me or one of our main highlight guys, Ken Barkley, who said, &#x201C;Man, that penalty on [Kiko] Alonso was a big deal. That was iffy. They should&#x2019;ve had the ball.&#x201D; As that&#x2019;s happening, we&#x2019;re saying that&#x2019;s something that ought to be in the highlights. </p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.g">As the bigger games are going on, we&#x2019;re watching with that lens. What can we illuminate here? Obviously we can&#x2019;t do that with every game; we can&#x2019;t watch with twenty eyeballs on it. But with games we&#x2019;re giving the bigger highlight treatment, that&#x2019;s the goal.</p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>Your show has a couple of segments, &#x201C;Winners&#x201D; and &#x201C;Bad Beats,&#x201D; about the gambling spread. Sports has a short-term stock market, full stop. Do you think we&#x2019;re done talking around it?</strong> <br>Yes. People still get so excited when Al Michaels or Brent Musburger make this thinly veiled reference to the line. You get the idea they&#x2019;re jumping up and down going, &#x201C;They talked about the spread! They talked about the spread!&#x201D; Well we&#x2019;re going to talk about it like adults and say, &#x201C;Boy, if you had the under in the BYU game, that was awful, and we&#x2019;ll show you how.&#x201D; This isn&#x2019;t the elephant in the room. We&#x2019;re sitting down and having shots with the elephant in the room. </p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.i">The climate is such that everyone recognizes it&#x2019;s always been done. The conversations going on right now are about FanDuel and DraftKings, whether or not that&#x2019;s gambling. I&#x2019;m sorry, but it is, man. If you&#x2019;re putting money into accounts, you&#x2019;re going to head-to-head with people, and you&#x2019;re winning or losing money based on the outcomes of games, then you&#x2019;re betting on sports. I think three out of every four ads this weekend was for it. </p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.j">I&#x2019;m just talking about guys who are getting three and a half or giving three and a half, and the bosses are obviously letting me do it. We&#x2019;re addressing what I perceive to be a decent chunk of our audience that&#x2019;s familiar with getting or giving points.</p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.k"><strong>What&#x2019;s the beat you&#x2019;ve experienced or heard about?</strong><br>That&#x2019;s why the segment has a beauty to it&#x2014;because every time you think you&#x2019;ve seen it, something more horrendous comes around the corner. </p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.l">I think the Belk Bowl has come to represent that worst beat anyone ever remembers. The CliffsNotes are this: Duke was getting about nine points and they were about the score with a minute or so left in a tie game. They fumbled on the five-yard line, then Cincinnati scored on about an 85-yard touchdown. So it&#x2019;s still in the final minute, and Duke has the ball, and then there&#x2019;s a pick-six on basically the last play of the game. </p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.m">So you had a nine-point underdog getting ready to score. They&#x2019;re maybe going to win the game, and they&#x2019;re definitely going to cover. But the fumble, the touchdown, the pick-six&#x2014;it all happened in a span of five minutes, real time, in a bowl game everyone watched during the holiday season. Say &#x201C;Belk Bowl&#x201D; to anyone who bets, and see if you don&#x2019;t get a reaction.</p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>You always seem composed and self-assured. Does a new gig&#x2014;a very personality-driven gig&#x2014;dig up new self-consciousness about the need to be smart or funny for your audience?</strong><br>All you can try to be is who you are. I think I&#x2019;m self-aware, if nothing else. I know I&#x2019;m not the smartest guy, not the most educated fan. There are fans who are going to know more than me. You can&#x2019;t try too hard to be funny. I think you learn what you find funny, and your audience is either going to be with you or they&#x2019;re not. I think my bosses put me out there because they trust me and my instincts to be who I am. You just have to believe that&#x2019;s enough.</p><p data-reactid=".d2348b5k3k.1.1.0.0.4.o">If you really stopped and thought, here&#x2019;s this <em>SportsCenter</em> and they&#x2019;re giving you an hour, that could be paralyzing, man. Like, Jesus, how do I do this? Well, they didn&#x2019;t put you out here to be something more than you are, so just go do what you do. You have to know it won&#x2019;t be for everyone. There will people who will say, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t stand this asshole.&#x201D; Well, I&#x2019;m sorry. There will be others who will say, &#x201C;We enjoy this.
