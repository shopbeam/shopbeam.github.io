  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000A \u0022If Haley can shake this civil rights mess,\u0022 Bubba Mott was saying, \u0022he\u0027d make an excellent president.\u0022 It was a humid morning in the middle of April and Mott was chauffeuring me in his black Cadillac through the deserted streets of Yazoo City, Mississippi. I had come to this town of less than 15,000 on the eastern edge of the Delta to learn more about one of its favorite sons, Haley Barbour, the Governor of Mississippi, who at that moment a mere two weeks ago seemed all but certain to run for the White House. Mott, the former owner of the Yazoo Herald and an old friend of Barbour\u0027s, was serving as my guide—to both the man and the town, which, ever since Barbour had tried to soft-pedal Yazoo City\u0027s segregationist past, had become inextricably linked.\u000A\u000A \u0022You heard of the Citizens Councils?\u0022 Barbour asked The Weekly Standard\u0027s Andrew Ferguson last December. \u0022Up north they think it was like the KKK. Where I come from it was an organization of town leaders. In Yazoo City they passed a resolution that said anybody who started a chapter of the Klan would get their ass run out of town. If you had a job, you\u0027d lose it. If you had a store, they\u0027d see nobody shopped there. We didn\u0027t have a problem with the Klan in Yazoo City.\u0022\u000A\u000A \u0022This was a nice little town,\u0022 Mott reminisced as he drove by a Dollar Store, one of the only bustling businesses Yazoo City has left these days. \u0022It was really a Mayberry in a lot of ways. Haley was quoted as saying things were good and of course he was criticized. \u0027Blah blah blah. It was horrible.\u0027 It wasn\u0027t horrible. People got along fine.\u0022\u000A\u000A When Barbour announced yesterday that he would not run for president, the news came as a shock not just to the reporters who\u0027ve been covering him but even to the operatives he had hired to staff his presumptive campaign. And the guessing game immediately began about why, after giving every indication for the past six months that he was going to run, he had decided at the last minute to stay put in Mississippi. Some took at face value Barbour\u0027s claim that he lacked the \u0022absolute fire in the belly\u0022 demanded by a presidential campaign, noting that, at 63 years old, his famously large body is already showing signs of wear and tear. Indeed, Barbour had begun privately referring to his recent swings through Iowa, South Carolina, and New Hampshire as his \u0022death march.\u0022 Others speculated about family reasons: His wife, Marsha, had publicly expressed her reluctance about Barbour running for president and Jackson has been abuzz with gossip about how she might respond privately if he went ahead with the campaign.\u000A\u000A But neither of these explanations are entirely convincing. After all, Barbour had lost 20 pounds in recent months and was determined to lose 20 more—I recently witnessed his newfound self-restraint when I watched him daintily take just a couple bites of a chicken sandwich during a luncheon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. And Marsha had voiced objections to many of Barbour\u0027s previous political endeavors, only to come around in the end. \u0022I\u0027ve known her as long as I\u0027ve known Haley,\u0022 Clarke Reed, the father of the modern Mississippi Republican Party and Barbour\u0027s political mentor, told me a couple weeks ago, recalling how Marsha had once tried to persuade her husband to quit his job as ecutive director of the Mississippi GOP. \u0022She\u0027s very frank, she\u0027s very independent, but she\u0027s going to back Haley.\u0022\u000A\u000A The likely rationale for Barbour\u0027s decision to pull the plug on his presidential bid might have been the most pragmatic: he realized he couldn\u0027t win. As one of the GOP\u0027s savviest operators—\u0022maybe the most brilliant political strategist in America today,\u0022 according to Mike Huckabee—Barbour was fully cognizant of his political liabilities, from his career as a lobbyist to his stewardship of a state that routinely ranks 50th in things like health care and education. Over the past few months he appeared to have developed satisfying responses to the inevitable attacks he would face on those issues. But what Barbour was never able to do, as he must have eventually realized, was find a persuasive way to talk about race and civil rights—and Yazoo City.\u000A\u000A···\u000A\u000A As a boy, Haley Barbour was a prince of Yazoo City. A Delta aristocrat by birth—the Barbours had been in Yazoo City for five generations and were one of its most prominent families—Haley had more than just strong bloodlines going for him. He was a star athlete and a straight-A student. \u0022He could have been mayor of Yazoo City when he was twelve,\u0022 his childhood friend Ardis Russell recalls. Such was Barbour\u0027s charmed boyhood that in February 1965, when the Yazoo Herald wanted to remind its readers that Valentine\u0027s Day was fast approaching, it did so with a front-page, heart-framed photo of Barbour, age 17, planting a kiss on the cheek of a pretty high school classmate.\u000A\u000A But it was two articles flanking that front-page photo that paint a less idyllic picture of Barbour\u0027s boyhood days. One advertised an upcoming meeting \u0022for all white citizens\u0022 of a neighboring town, where the judge who had recently presided over Byron de la Beckwith\u0027s mistrial for the murder of Medgar Evers would \u0022answer many questions that are on the minds of most Mississippians on the problems confronting us today.\u0022 The other was an editorial by Bubba Mott arguing that nothing in the 1964 Civil Rights Act mandates that \u0022a school or public facility has to be racially integrated. The law merely says you can\u0027t have a policy of denying admission on the grounds of race.... In other words, an institution won\u0027t be segregated even if all persons involved are of one race. It\u0027s just a matter of what is the official policy.\u0022\u000A\u000A And yet, according to some of Barbour\u0027s Yazoo City contemporaries, it wasn\u0027t unusual for teenagers of that era to be blissfully unaware of the injustices around them. \u0022Haley had his mind on girls and football and flirting and talking with the guys,\u0022 says Russell, who was in the class of 1966, one year behind Barbour\u0027s, at the all-white Yazoo City High School. \u0022We did not do the racial talk: \u0027Did you see that \u0027n\u0027 on TV last night?\u0027 Or \u0027What do you think about them n\u0027s?\u0027 You had a couple of rednecks who might say something like that and, when they did, Haley was the kind of guy that would give them a look, that Barbour stare, like \u0027You\u0027re killing me.\u0027\u0022\u000A\u000A Even some of Barbour\u0027s black contemporaries shared this sense of quiet, almost oblivious distance. \u0022We were in different worlds,\u0022 Clifton Jones, who graduated from Yazoo City\u0027s black high school, N.D. Taylor, in 1967, told me. \u0022They were over there and we were over here. I couldn\u0027t determine what the problems were because everybody stayed in their own little world.\u0022 Although Jones and other black Yazoo Citians were forced to grow up drinking from separate water fountains, attending separate schools, living in separate neighborhoods, and being permitted to shop in Yazoo City\u0027s then-bustling downtown only on Saturdays, segregation also frequently managed to insulate them from overt racial conflict. \u0022We were having fun with our own thing,\u0022 explains Jones, who\u0027s the former president of the local NAACP and is now a Yazoo City alderman. \u0022They didn\u0027t bother us. And we weren\u0027t curious at all. I guess if you don\u0027t know something, it don\u0027t bother you.\u0022\u000A\u000A Driving around Yazoo City, Bubba Mott, who is now in his 80s, tried to explain this context, to help his friend Haley clean up his \u0022civil rights mess.\u0022 Most of that mess, he conceded, stemmed from Barbour\u0027s praise of the Citizens\u0027 Council, which seemed worse than amnesia. After all, in 1955 the Yazoo City Citizens Council had launched an economic boycott against 53 black city residents who, in the wake of Brown v. Board, had signed a petition calling for the integration of Yazoo City\u0027s schools—ultimately driving 51 of them to withdraw their names. Mott, at the time, had supported the Citizens Council, which was headed up by Haley Barbour\u0027s uncle William, a prominent Yazoo City lawyer who was also a father figure to Haley, whose own father had died when he was only two.\u000A\u000A But Mott eventually became one of Yazoo City\u0027s most progressive voices, penning editorials in the Herald that ultimately paved the way for the successful integration of Yazoo City\u0027s schools in 1970. (In his book about that achievement, Yazoo: Integration in a Deep Southern Town, Willie Morris, a racial liberal and Yazoo City\u0027s most famous son, wrote of Mott: \u0022If they give a Pulitzer Prize for an editor who speaks from deep inside himself, from travail and a personal recommitment, then he deserves it.\u0022) But, like Barbour with The Weekly Standard, Mott could not bring himself to condemn everything about the way things had once been. \u0022Let me tell you a story,\u0022 he said, after we had been in his car for close to an hour and were now driving down some of the same streets for the third and fourth times. \u0022I ain\u0027t never told this story, and maybe I shouldn\u0027t be telling it to you.\u0022\u000A\u000A Mott said that one early morning in the mid-1960s, the salesman who worked for the office supply business that was attached to the Herald called him in a panic. \u0022He said, \u0027I need to see you right away,\u0027\u0022 Mott recalled. \u0022He lived up on the hill near Hayman\u0027s Bluff, and I went up there to see him and he met me with no shirt on, unshaven, and he was holding a .45 pistol.\u0022 The salesman told Mott that he had been working undercover for the FBI to help infiltrate the local Klan, but that his cover had been blown, and now he needed $500 so he and his wife and child could leave town. \u0022I didn\u0027t have five hundred dollars, so I called Haley\u0027s uncle.\u0022 Together, William and Haley\u0027s mother, LeFlore, who worked as William\u0027s legal secretary, went to meet with the salesman at a local motel—and, in exchange for $500, he told them the names of all the local members of the Klan. \u0022\u0022And, the result of that, through economic pressure, some of those would-be Klan leaders were treated just like the blacks were treated who signed that petition,\u0022 Mott said.\u0022And they left. No violence. Never. And nothing illegal. Economic pressure. \u0027Hey, you owe me money. Pay me now or I\u0027ll sue.\u0027 That kind of stuff. They foreclosed on loans or mortgages and drove you out of business. Gone. And that\u0027s what they did. Now that\u0027s probably not a point, but that\u0027s who they were.\u0022\u000A\u000A It is hard not to wonder whether that episode is what Barbour had been referring to when he made his remark about the Citizens Council helping to make sure Klansmen \u0022got their ass run out of town.\u0022 He wasn\u0027t just talking about some abstract group of town leaders. He was talking about his uncle and his mother and perhaps repeating a piece of family lore. I asked Mott if, given all that, he thought there was some way that Barbour could talk about race and civil rights and Yazoo City that wouldn\u0027t make him seem so insensitive—that wouldn\u0027t feed the perception that Barbour, 40 years later, was still on the wrong side of history.\u000A\u000A \u0022I wish I knew, I wish I knew,\u0022 Mott replied. \u0022I don\u0027t know. He\u0027s smart enough to know, and if there\u0027s a way to figure it out he will.\u0022 He paused to think a little more. \u0022But if he hasn\u0027t figured out how you overcome it, or pretty well minimize it, in my opinion he won\u0027t run.\u0022 As it turned, Mott knew his old friend awfully well.",

shake this civil rights mess,&quot; Bubba Mott was saying, &quot;he&apos;d make an excellent president.&quot; It was a humid morning in the middle of April and Mott was chauffeuring me in his black Cadillac through the deserted streets of Yazoo City, Mississippi. I had come to this town of less than 15,000 on the eastern edge of the Delta to learn more about one of its favorite sons, Haley Barbour, the Governor of Mississippi, who at that moment a mere two weeks ago seemed all but certain to run for the White House. Mott, the former owner of the <em>Yazoo Herald</em> and an old friend of Barbour&apos;s, was serving as my guide&#x2014;to both the man and the town, which, ever since Barbour had tried to soft-pedal Yazoo City&apos;s segregationist past, had become inextricably linked.</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.2"> &quot;You heard of the Citizens Councils?&quot; Barbour asked <em>The Weekly Standard</em>&apos;s Andrew Ferguson last December. &quot;Up north they think it was like the KKK. Where I come from it was an organization of town leaders. In Yazoo City they passed a resolution that said anybody who started a chapter of the Klan would get their ass run out of town. If you had a job, you&apos;d lose it. If you had a store, they&apos;d see nobody shopped there. We didn&apos;t have a problem with the Klan in Yazoo City.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.3"> &quot;This was a nice little town,&quot; Mott reminisced as he drove by a Dollar Store, one of the only bustling businesses Yazoo City has left these days. &quot;It was really a Mayberry in a lot of ways. Haley was quoted as saying things were good and of course he was criticized. &apos;Blah blah blah. It was horrible.&apos; It wasn&apos;t horrible. People got along fine.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.5"> When Barbour announced yesterday that he would not run for president, the news came as a shock not just to the reporters who&apos;ve been covering him but even to the operatives he had hired to staff his presumptive campaign. And the guessing game immediately began about why, after giving every indication for the past six months that he was going to run, he had decided at the last minute to stay put in Mississippi. Some took at face value Barbour&apos;s claim that he lacked the &quot;absolute fire in the belly&quot; demanded by a presidential campaign, noting that, at 63 years old, his famously large body is already showing signs of wear and tear. Indeed, Barbour had begun privately referring to his recent swings through Iowa, South Carolina, and New Hampshire as his &quot;death march.&quot; Others speculated about family reasons: His wife, Marsha, had publicly expressed her reluctance about Barbour running for president and Jackson has been abuzz with gossip about how she might respond privately if he went ahead with the campaign.</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.6"> But neither of these explanations are entirely convincing. After all, Barbour had lost 20 pounds in recent months and was determined to lose 20 more&#x2014;I recently witnessed his newfound self-restraint when I watched him daintily take just a couple bites of a chicken sandwich during a luncheon in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. And Marsha had voiced objections to many of Barbour&apos;s previous political endeavors, only to come around in the end. &quot;I&apos;ve known her as long as I&apos;ve known Haley,&quot; Clarke Reed, the father of the modern Mississippi Republican Party and Barbour&apos;s political mentor, told me a couple weeks ago, recalling how Marsha had once tried to persuade her husband to quit his job as ecutive director of the Mississippi GOP. &quot;She&apos;s very frank, she&apos;s very independent, but she&apos;s going to back Haley.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.7"> The likely rationale for Barbour&apos;s decision to pull the plug on his presidential bid might have been the most pragmatic: he realized he couldn&apos;t win. As one of the GOP&apos;s savviest operators&#x2014;&quot;maybe the most brilliant political strategist in America today,&quot; according to Mike Huckabee&#x2014;Barbour was fully cognizant of his political liabilities, from his career as a lobbyist to his stewardship of a state that routinely ranks 50th in things like health care and education. Over the past few months he appeared to have developed satisfying responses to the inevitable attacks he would face on those issues. But what Barbour was never able to do, as he must have eventually realized, was find a persuasive way to talk about race and civil rights&#x2014;and Yazoo City.</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.8">&#xB7;&#xB7;&#xB7;</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.9"> As a boy, Haley Barbour was a prince of Yazoo City. A Delta aristocrat by birth&#x2014;the Barbours had been in Yazoo City for five generations and were one of its most prominent families&#x2014;Haley had more than just strong bloodlines going for him. He was a star athlete and a straight-A student. &quot;He could have been mayor of Yazoo City when he was twelve,&quot; his childhood friend Ardis Russell recalls. Such was Barbour&apos;s charmed boyhood that in February 1965, when the <em>Yazoo Herald</em> wanted to remind its readers that Valentine&apos;s Day was fast approaching, it did so with a front-page, heart-framed photo of Barbour, age 17, planting a kiss on the cheek of a pretty high school classmate.</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.a"> But it was two articles flanking that front-page photo that paint a less idyllic picture of Barbour&apos;s boyhood days. One advertised an upcoming meeting &quot;for all white citizens&quot; of a neighboring town, where the judge who had recently presided over Byron de la Beckwith&apos;s mistrial for the murder of Medgar Evers would &quot;answer many questions that are on the minds of most Mississippians on the problems confronting us today.&quot; The other was an editorial by Bubba Mott arguing that nothing in the 1964 Civil Rights Act mandates that &quot;a school or public facility has to be racially integrated. The law merely says you can&apos;t have a policy of denying admission on the grounds of race.... In other words, an institution won&apos;t be segregated even if all persons involved are of one race. It&apos;s just a matter of what is the official policy.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.b"> And yet, according to some of Barbour&apos;s Yazoo City contemporaries, it wasn&apos;t unusual for teenagers of that era to be blissfully unaware of the injustices around them. &quot;Haley had his mind on girls and football and flirting and talking with the guys,&quot; says Russell, who was in the class of 1966, one year behind Barbour&apos;s, at the all-white Yazoo City High School. &quot;We did not do the racial talk: &apos;Did you see that &apos;n&apos; on TV last night?&apos; Or &apos;What do you think about them n&apos;s?&apos; You had a couple of rednecks who might say something like that and, when they did, Haley was the kind of guy that would give them a look, that Barbour stare, like &apos;You&apos;re killing me.&apos;&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.c"> Even some of Barbour&apos;s black contemporaries shared this sense of quiet, almost oblivious distance. &quot;We were in different worlds,&quot; Clifton Jones, who graduated from Yazoo City&apos;s black high school, N.D. Taylor, in 1967, told me. &quot;They were over there and we were over here. I couldn&apos;t determine what the problems were because everybody stayed in their own little world.&quot; Although Jones and other black Yazoo Citians were forced to grow up drinking from separate water fountains, attending separate schools, living in separate neighborhoods, and being permitted to shop in Yazoo City&apos;s then-bustling downtown only on Saturdays, segregation also frequently managed to insulate them from overt racial conflict. &quot;We were having fun with our own thing,&quot; explains Jones, who&apos;s the former president of the local NAACP and is now a Yazoo City alderman. &quot;They didn&apos;t bother us. And we weren&apos;t curious at all. I guess if you don&apos;t know something, it don&apos;t bother you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.d"> Driving around Yazoo City, Bubba Mott, who is now in his 80s, tried to explain this context, to help his friend Haley clean up his &quot;civil rights mess.&quot; Most of that mess, he conceded, stemmed from Barbour&apos;s praise of the Citizens&apos; Council, which seemed worse than amnesia. After all, in 1955 the Yazoo City Citizens Council had launched an economic boycott against 53 black city residents who, in the wake of Brown v. Board, had signed a petition calling for the integration of Yazoo City&apos;s schools&#x2014;ultimately driving 51 of them to withdraw their names. Mott, at the time, had supported the Citizens Council, which was headed up by Haley Barbour&apos;s uncle William, a prominent Yazoo City lawyer who was also a father figure to Haley, whose own father had died when he was only two.</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.e"> But Mott eventually became one of Yazoo City&apos;s most progressive voices, penning editorials in the Herald that ultimately paved the way for the successful integration of Yazoo City&apos;s schools in 1970. (In his book about that achievement, <em>Yazoo: Integration in a Deep Southern Town</em>, Willie Morris, a racial liberal and Yazoo City&apos;s most famous son, wrote of Mott: &quot;If they give a Pulitzer Prize for an editor who speaks from deep inside himself, from travail and a personal recommitment, then he deserves it.&quot;) But, like Barbour with <em>The Weekly Standard</em>, Mott could not bring himself to condemn everything about the way things had once been. &quot;Let me tell you a story,&quot; he said, after we had been in his car for close to an hour and were now driving down some of the same streets for the third and fourth times. &quot;I ain&apos;t never told this story, and maybe I shouldn&apos;t be telling it to you.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.f"> Mott said that one early morning in the mid-1960s, the salesman who worked for the office supply business that was attached to the <em>Herald</em> called him in a panic. &quot;He said, &apos;I need to see you right away,&apos;&quot; Mott recalled. &quot;He lived up on the hill near Hayman&apos;s Bluff, and I went up there to see him and he met me with no shirt on, unshaven, and he was holding a .45 pistol.&quot; The salesman told Mott that he had been working undercover for the FBI to help infiltrate the local Klan, but that his cover had been blown, and now he needed $500 so he and his wife and child could leave town. &quot;I didn&apos;t have five hundred dollars, so I called Haley&apos;s uncle.&quot; Together, William and Haley&apos;s mother, LeFlore, who worked as William&apos;s legal secretary, went to meet with the salesman at a local motel&#x2014;and, in exchange for $500, he told them the names of all the local members of the Klan. &quot;&quot;And, the result of that, through economic pressure, some of those would-be Klan leaders were treated just like the blacks were treated who signed that petition,&quot; Mott said.&quot;And they left. No violence. Never. And nothing illegal. Economic pressure. &apos;Hey, you owe me money. Pay me now or I&apos;ll sue.&apos; That kind of stuff. They foreclosed on loans or mortgages and drove you out of business. Gone. And that&apos;s what they did. Now that&apos;s probably not a point, but that&apos;s who they were.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.g"> It is hard not to wonder whether that episode is what Barbour had been referring to when he made his remark about the Citizens Council helping to make sure Klansmen &quot;got their ass run out of town.&quot; He wasn&apos;t just talking about some abstract group of town leaders. He was talking about his uncle and his mother and perhaps repeating a piece of family lore. I asked Mott if, given all that, he thought there was some way that Barbour could talk about race and civil rights and Yazoo City that wouldn&apos;t make him seem so insensitive&#x2014;that wouldn&apos;t feed the perception that Barbour, 40 years later, was still on the wrong side of history.</p><p data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.4.h"> &quot;I wish I knew, I wish I knew,&quot; Mott replied. &quot;I don&apos;t know. He&apos;s smart enough to know, and if there&apos;s a way to figure it out he will.&quot; He paused to think a little more. &quot;But if he hasn&apos;t figured out how you overcome it, or pretty well minimize it, in my opinion he won&apos;t run.&quot; As it turned, Mott knew his old friend awfully well.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".2bx00dr6l8g.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row"
