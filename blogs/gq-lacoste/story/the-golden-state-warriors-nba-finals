  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AI had fully planned to write this column from a bar. Game Six of the 2015 NBA Finals left a lot to be desired and after the superstar showcase of Game Five, it was hardly a fitting end to such an entertaining series. The better team, which also happened to have been the best team in the league since last fall, won a title. It happens.\u000A\u000ABut the more I think about it, the more I really believe that this Warriors team could change the face of professional basketball. We\u0027ve been hearing about a small-ball trend ever since Steve Nash\u0027s Phoenix Suns—now a decade in the rear-view—but this is the first team to win a title while eschewing traditional positions and erring on the side of speed, skill and versatility. And while noble-in-defeat LeBron James has long defied the logic of the game, he\u0027s also been the exception that proves the rule. The Warriors are an outright revolution.\u000A\u000AThe team, which won a staggering 67 games under first-time head coach Steve Kerr, uses and space and spacing like no team in recent memory, opening up lanes and opportunities in a way that makes everything look easy—and presumably, easier for the guys out on the court. A lot of the time, they do so with wide, seemingly reckless passes that, if any less precise or zippy, would be picked off on sight by the league\u0027s top-tier defenders. On defense, they\u0027re similarly fluid, employing team-oriented schemes that allow flexibility while clamping down when they need to.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not just the system, though. In the same way as it would\u0027ve been a challenge to replicate the Suns without Nash, the Warriors rely on Stephen Curry not only to make plays and score baskets but also to set the master plan into motion. If the Warriors are a well-oiled machine, Steph is the spark that makes it all possible. He\u0027s a truly singular player; calling him a shooter, a scorer, or a playmaker shortchanges his ability to be all those three at once, a quality that keeps defenses from ever really being able to settle in against him.\u000A\u000ACurry is omnidirectional. He\u0027s as likely to knife to the basket or reel off a no-look assist as he is drop back for a long three. And he does all of it with the same easygoing, elastic confidence. You can\u0027t check Stephen Curry because you never really know exactly what you\u0027re up against.\u000A\u000ABut there\u0027s the letter of new-fangled basketball and then there\u0027s the spirit, and teams could certainly learn a lot from examining the model of Curry et al. There may not be another Curry on the horizon, or another Klay Thompson (flame-throwing shooter who can also post up smaller guards and get physical on defense) or Draymond Green (athletic hustle guy who can do just about whatever the team needs done on offense while guarding four positions at the other end). That commitment to let players play their respective games, though, is the crucial insight.\u000A\u000AIt also happens to be the exact opposite of how basketball orthodoxy works. There\u0027s no top-down assignation of roles. Rather, there\u0027s a loose framework that can play to the strengths of a Curry, Thompson, Green, Finals MVP Andre Iguodala, or a rando like refurbished guard Shaun Livingston, thus allowing them to flourish.\u000A\u000AWhat\u0027s most remarkable about the Warriors\u0027 title is that they closed it out with an inconsistent, injury-addled Curry, a slumping Thompson, and a line-up so tiny that the 6\u00277\u0022 Green stepped in at center. Iguodala was the team\u0027s strongest contributor and secondary guys like Livingston stepped up as needed. It\u0027s a true basketball democracy, where for lack of a sharper phrase, everyone can be himself as long as they acknowledge the basic ground rules. And it\u0027s a system set up to accommodate all sorts of styles—not out of altruism or tolerance but because that\u0027s simply a smarter, more adaptive way to win basketball games.\u000A\u000AA friend of mine pointed out that the Warriors could survive with Curry and Thompson at less than full-strength because unlike the Cavs, they weren\u0027t wholly dependent on their superstars. That\u0027s a more cutting way of saying that the team has an inclusive philosophy. There\u0027s no real pecking order; the Warriors go out there and play regardless of who is hot or cold. In that sense, Iguodala being honored as the Finals MVP was the most Warriors thing ever.\u000A\u000AWhen the Warriors first started running away with the season, it looked like 2014-15 was going to be one of those transitional years nestled in between dynasties. The title was expected to be up for grabs, which allowed all sorts of unexpected faces and places to get their time in the spotlight. In fact, Golden State\u0027s only other title came in 1975, which was certainly one of those liminal years. As the season progressed, though, other teams and players came and went while the Warriors and Curry reigned supreme. They hit the ground running, a fully-formed idea whose time had come, and never really let up.\u000A\u000AThat Golden State dominated 2014-15 like they did suggests that if other teams are smart, they\u0027ll learn a thing or two from this team. This isn\u0027t a fad or a fluke this isn\u0027t the Suns repeatedly coming up short or getting exposed. We\u0027re seeing a team that plays creative, flexible, and heady basketball, one that truly believes in letting personnel dictate their role on the court, emerge as the team to beat in the NBA.\u000A\u000AIf the Warriors are indeed the shape of basketball to come, that\u0027s a good thing—for players, fans, and coaches or general managers open-minded enough to rise to the challenge. Increasingly, it\u0027s looking like they might set a new benchmark for the game. They aren\u0027t a bridge to whatever comes next. They are the future itself.",

Game Six of the 2015 NBA Finals left a lot to be desired and after the superstar showcase of Game Five, it was hardly a fitting end to such an entertaining series. The better team, which also happened to have been the best team in the league since last fall, won a title. It happens.</p><p data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.4.2">But the more I think about it, the more I really believe that this Warriors team could change the face of professional basketball. We&apos;ve been hearing about a small-ball trend ever since Steve Nash&apos;s Phoenix Suns&#x2014;now a decade in the rear-view&#x2014;but this is the first team to win a title while eschewing traditional positions and erring on the side of speed, skill and versatility. And while noble-in-defeat LeBron James has long defied the logic of the game, he&apos;s also been the exception that proves the rule. The Warriors are an outright revolution.</p><p data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.4.3">The team, which won a staggering 67 games under first-time head coach Steve Kerr, uses and space and spacing like no team in recent memory, opening up lanes and opportunities in a way that makes everything look easy&#x2014;and presumably, easier for the guys out on the court. A lot of the time, they do so with wide, seemingly reckless passes that, if any less precise or zippy, would be picked off on sight by the league&apos;s top-tier defenders. On defense, they&apos;re similarly fluid, employing team-oriented schemes that allow flexibility while clamping down when they need to.</p><p data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.4.5">It&apos;s not just the system, though. In the same way as it would&apos;ve been a challenge to replicate the Suns without Nash, the Warriors rely on Stephen Curry not only to make plays and score baskets but also to set the master plan into motion. If the Warriors are a well-oiled machine, Steph is the spark that makes it all possible. He&apos;s a truly singular player; calling him a shooter, a scorer, or a playmaker shortchanges his ability to be all those three at once, a quality that keeps defenses from ever really being able to settle in against him.</p><p data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.4.6">Curry is omnidirectional. He&apos;s as likely to knife to the basket or reel off a no-look assist as he is drop back for a long three. And he does all of it with the same easygoing, elastic confidence. You can&apos;t check Stephen Curry because you never really know exactly what you&apos;re up against.</p><p data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.4.7">But there&apos;s the letter of new-fangled basketball and then there&apos;s the spirit, and teams could certainly learn a lot from examining the model of Curry et al. There may not be another Curry on the horizon, or another Klay Thompson (flame-throwing shooter who can also post up smaller guards and get physical on defense) or Draymond Green (athletic hustle guy who can do just about whatever the team needs done on offense while guarding four positions at the other end). That commitment to let players play their respective games, though, is the crucial insight.</p><p data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.4.8">It also happens to be the exact opposite of how basketball orthodoxy works. There&apos;s no top-down assignation of roles. Rather, there&apos;s a loose framework that can play to the strengths of a Curry, Thompson, Green, Finals MVP Andre Iguodala, or a rando like refurbished guard Shaun Livingston, thus allowing them to flourish.</p><p data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.4.9">What&apos;s most remarkable about the Warriors&apos; title is that they closed it out with an inconsistent, injury-addled Curry, a slumping Thompson, and a line-up so tiny that the 6&apos;7&quot; Green stepped in at center. Iguodala was the team&apos;s strongest contributor and secondary guys like Livingston stepped up as needed. It&apos;s a true basketball democracy, where for lack of a sharper phrase, everyone can be himself as long as they acknowledge the basic ground rules. And it&apos;s a system set up to accommodate all sorts of styles&#x2014;not out of altruism or tolerance but because that&apos;s simply a smarter, more adaptive way to win basketball games.</p><p data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.4.a">A friend of mine pointed out that the Warriors could survive with Curry and Thompson at less than full-strength because unlike the Cavs, they weren&apos;t wholly dependent on their superstars. That&apos;s a more cutting way of saying that the team has an inclusive philosophy. There&apos;s no real pecking order; the Warriors go out there and play regardless of who is hot or cold. In that sense, Iguodala being honored as the Finals MVP was the most Warriors thing ever.</p><p data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.4.b">When the Warriors first started running away with the season, it looked like 2014-15 was going to be one of those transitional years nestled in between dynasties. The title was expected to be up for grabs, which allowed all sorts of unexpected faces and places to get their time in the spotlight. In fact, Golden State&apos;s only other title came in 1975, which was certainly one of those liminal years. As the season progressed, though, other teams and players came and went while the Warriors and Curry reigned supreme. They hit the ground running, a fully-formed idea whose time had come, and never really let up.</p><p data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.4.c">That Golden State dominated 2014-15 like they did suggests that if other teams are smart, they&apos;ll learn a thing or two from this team. This isn&apos;t a fad or a fluke this isn&apos;t the Suns repeatedly coming up short or getting exposed. We&apos;re seeing a team that plays creative, flexible, and heady basketball, one that truly believes in letting personnel dictate their role on the court, emerge as the team to beat in the NBA.</p><p data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.4.d">If the Warriors are indeed the shape of basketball to come, that&apos;s a good thing&#x2014;for players, fans, and coaches or general managers open-minded enough to rise to the challenge. Increasingly, it&apos;s looking like they might set a new benchmark for the game. They aren&apos;t a bridge to whatever comes next. They are the future itself.</p></div><div class="grid" data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.5"><div class="row" data-reactid=".222z522lmo.1.1.0.0.5.0"><div class="col col-sm-15"
