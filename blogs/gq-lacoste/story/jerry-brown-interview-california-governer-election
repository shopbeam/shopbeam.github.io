  	    "articleBody": "\u000A\u000A He\u0027s back! Thirty-five years ago, Jerry Brown surged into the national spotlight as the doe-eyed young governor of California, with a floppy mop of rumpled hair, a quirky passion for outer space, and some of the earliest initiatives of the coming green revolution. In the span of two terms, between 1975 and 1983, he passed the nation\u0027s first efficiency standards for appliances and homes, made California the global leader in alternative energy (with 90% of the world\u0027s wind power), and set countless new benchmarks for clean air and water, even while presiding over a staggering budget surplus of more than $4 billion. . . that is, until California taxpayers made him give it all back.\u000A\u000A In an infamous 1978 referendum known as Proposition 13, voters slashed their property tas, obliterating state revenue and emptying Brown\u0027s coffers overnight. By the time he left office in 1983, the $4 billion surplus had slumped into a billion-dollar deficit, and today, many political analysts trace the state\u0027s financial decline to that first blow on Brown\u0027s watch. Yet the man himself has proven remarkably resilient. In the years since he left Sacramento, he has served as Mayor of Oakland, competed with Bill Clinton for the presidency, and in 2007, returned to statewide office as California\u0027s Attorney General — even while traversing the world in his spare time to seek spiritual enlightenment from figures like Mother Teresa and Japanese monks. At one point, he actually disappeared inside a Zen center for six months to meditate about \u0022the essential emptiness.\u0022\u000A\u000A Next month, California voters will choose between Brown and Republican candidate Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay. If Brown wins, the 72-year-old will become, by the end of his term, the oldest governor and the longest serving in state history. He will also become the first governor to win a third term since the state made it illegal to serve more than two. (More on that below.) We sat down with the notoriously feisty lifelong pol for two extended sessions, to probe the man nicknamed Governor Moonbeam about his contentious candidacy, his polarizing past, and his grand plan for the ultimate comeback.\u000A\u000A How has this campaign been different than your last run for governor?\u000A\u000A It started earlier. Never stops. Endless barrage of commercials. More expensive.\u000A\u000A So the bullshit quotient is higher?\u000A\u000A Well, the consultants and the manipulation are greater, particularly on the part of the Whitman campaign. She\u0027s a completely invented product, that is financed by the greatest sum of money ever spent in California.\u000A\u000A So why put yourself through it?\u000A\u000A Because California has got to be fid. Who else is gonna do it?\u000A\u000A Nobody else can do it?\u000A\u000A Well, who are they?\u000A\u000A Don\u0027t you have faith that somebody else could be governor?\u000A\u000A Who would it be?\u000A\u000A You tell me.\u000A\u000A I waited for someone else. They all dropped out.\u000A\u000A What about Gavin Newsom? \u000A\u000A He didn\u0027t run. Talk to him. He decided to run for lieutenant governor instead.\u000A\u000A Only because you pushed him out of the race and locked up the unions.\u000A\u000A No. It had nothing to do with that. I didn\u0027t do anything. I declared after he dropped out. I waited.\u000A\u000A That\u0027s not what I hear. \u000A\u000A Are you suggesting I don\u0027t run?\u000A\u000A I\u0027m asking why you want to. \u000A\u000A Why I want to?\u000A\u000A Yeah, from what you described, it sounds like it sucks.\u000A\u000A But this is what I do. I\u0027ve done it before. I understand the process. And I think I can fix it.\u000A\u000A When you were running for Attorney General in 2006, you said you wouldn\u0027t run for governor this year.\u000A\u000A That\u0027s what I was thinking.\u000A\u000A What changed?\u000A\u000A The state is in a huge mess, and I don\u0027t see anybody changing it. You wouldn\u0027t say there\u0027s anything wrong with running, would you?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t know. It might be wrong to run for a third term in a state that only allows two terms.\u000A\u000A Is that wrong?\u000A\u000A Well, the only reason it\u0027s legal is because your last term was before the term-limit law.\u000A\u000A Well, that\u0027s not the law. You have the law, or you don\u0027t have the law.\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s also the spirit of the law.\u000A\u000AWhat does that mean? The law is the law.\u000A\u000A Well, the law was written for a reason: to prevent a third term.\u000A\u000A That\u0027s not the issue in this campaign.\u000A\u000A Maybe not, but it\u0027s the issue I\u0027m asking about.\u000A\u000AWhat? Whether the term limit really applies to me, even though it doesn\u0027t say so?\u000A\u000AWhether it violates the spirit of the law to run for a third term in a two-term state.\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a spirit to the law. They passed the law to achieve a certain goal.\u000A\u000A What was the goal? That\u0027s what I\u0027m asking.\u000A\u000A The goal was kind of—there were a lot of interesting questions. But if you\u0027re asking, \u0022Can other people do this?\u0022 No. But I can. And we need some experience in Sacramento. The state has never been as screwed up as it is today, because of the inability to summon the courage to make the tough choices.\u000A\u000A What does \u0022the courage to make the tough choices\u0022 mean?\u000A\u000A To deal with the budget in an honest way, and lay it out to the people.\u000A\u000A Do you feel like fixing the state\u0027s finances would remedy your history with Proposition 13?\u000A\u000A What\u0027s my history with Prop 13?\u000A\u000A The last time you were governor, voters passed 13, which stunted property tas, gutted state revenue, and has been catastrophic for California\u0027s finances.\u000A\u000A No, that\u0027s not the case.\u000A\u000A You think Prop 13 was good for California\u0027s finances?\u000A\u000A In many ways—it\u0027s kept people in their homes.\u000A\u000A But what has it done to state revenue?\u000A\u000A Real estate revenue is much higher than anyone ever imagined before Prop 13, because of the turnover in property.\u000A\u000A But the rates were much higher before Prop 13, and that money funded schools, which are in a state of crisis now.\u000A\u000A But the value of property is much higher.\u000A\u000A Of course property values have gone up since the 1970s. Expenditures have gone up, too.\u000A\u000A My answer is no. I am not advocating the repeal of Prop 13.\u000A\u000A Do you think you should have stopped it in 1978?\u000A\u000A I should have offered more property-tax relief. But that would have cost the state money. I was too tight-fisted. I\u0027m not a big spender.\u000A\u000A You were also the last governor to have a veto overridden by the legislature, weren\u0027t you?\u000A\u000A I had a lot of tension with the legislature.\u000A\u000A So you\u0027ve had 30 years to look back. Have you used this time to reflect on what you would do differently as governor?\u000A\u000A I hope so.\u000A\u000A How would you operate differently?\u000A\u000A I\u0027ve learned that you\u0027ve got to respect legislators, number one. Because most governors don\u0027t. And that\u0027s very important to move the ball along. Number two, you have to craft a very focused agenda. You really have to build one brick on top of another. The legislature has 4,000 bills. Those bills represent hundreds of lobbyists, hundreds of millions of dollars of investments and concerns and loyalties and desires. Now the governor comes along and says, \u0022Guess what? I\u0027ve got a plan. I want a water plan. I want to change education. I want to do this.\u0022 Well, the governor has to connect that to what the legislature wants.\u000A\u000A Does Meg Whitman understand that?\u000A\u000A No. She\u0027s from a corporate culture.\u000A\u000A What\u0027s the difference?\u000A\u000A Well, she has more of a CEO mindset. Businesses run on a more autocratic process, where the CEO has much greater control than an elected official does. The civil service, collective bargaining, the free press—all these things are very different than a private office where you can shut the door and say, \u0022We\u0027ve got to slash 10% of the work force,\u0022 or, \u0022We\u0027re going into this business and selling that business.\u0022 That flexibility is alien to the government process, which is more cumbersome, more conflict-ridden, and requires compromise at every turn. There are all these conflicting vectors of power pushing against government, and the leader has to persuade. A CEO can coerce.\u000A\u000A Do you think her self-funding is a problem?\u000A\u000A It\u0027s the same problem. When you\u0027re raising money, you\u0027ve got to listen to a lot of people. So you see a diversity that you wouldn\u0027t otherwise see. If you have a billion dollars and just write a check, then all you have to do is make speeches. When you have to raise money, you\u0027re on the telephone, you\u0027ve got to meet people, go to dinners. . .\u000A\u000A Is there any way you can compete with her funding?\u000A\u000A No. Because there\u0027s no limit to what she can spend. If she fills up television, she can do radio. If she fills up radio, she can do mail. If she fills up mail, she can do newspapers. If she fills up newspapers, she can do skywriting. . .\u000A\u000A Let\u0027s talk about illegal immigration, which has the potential to be a flash point in this campaign.\u000A\u000A No.\u000A\u000A You don\u0027t think so?\u000A\u000A No.\u000A\u000A Well, let\u0027s talk about it, anyway. What\u0027s your policy on sanctuary cities [those cities that don\u0027t enforce federal immigration laws]?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t support sanctuary cities. What are we talking about, two or three cities?\u000A\u000A Two or three huge cities: San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego.\u000A\u000A San Francisco has changed. And I\u0027m not familiar with San Diego. The answer is a national reform, which I support. Meg doesn\u0027t. She doesn\u0027t want a path to citizenship and comprehensive reform. I think that\u0027s the only thing to do.\u000A\u000A Do you think we have a problem with illegal immigration?\u000A\u000A I think it\u0027s a problem. Because you have people who are here against the law. They\u0027re living in a shadow world. It\u0027s not a good thing.\u000A\u000A So if you could snap your fingers and have the 11 or 12 million undocumented workers in this country leave, would you do that?\u000A\u000A Well, that\u0027s not possible. That\u0027s a counterfactual.\u000A\u000A It\u0027s a hypothetical. But all questions in political races are hypothetical, such as: What will you do as governor?\u000A\u000A But how would you bring it about?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t know, but the first question is whether you want to: Would you like to see the undocumented workers go home?\u000A\u000A We also have to spend more time worrying about Mexico—they need to raise their standard of living, and that will calm the immigration flow.\u000A\u000A But I\u0027m asking about the people who are already here. Would you want them to stay or go?\u000A\u000A The only way forward is a comprehensive reform bill.\u000A\u000A With amnesty?\u000A\u000A I would call it, \u0022A path to citizenship.\u0022 That\u0027s the only human thing to do.\u000A\u000A Do you think this country is hypocritical about illegal labor?\u000A\u000A There are a lot of contradictions in our individual lives, and in our collective life. That\u0027s been true since Jefferson wrote that all men are created equal, and had slaves. Contradiction is inherent in human nature.\u000A\u000A That\u0027s a pretty big answer to a specific question.\u000A\u000A All right, well, ask it again.\u000A\u000A Do you think it\u0027s hypocritical for us to. . .\u000A\u000A I\u0027m not going to say America is hypocritical, if that\u0027s what you want me to say.\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t want you to say anything. I just want to know what you think.\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t want to say that. I don\u0027t think they\u0027re any more hypocritical than you or I. We don\u0027t always notice all the nuances and contradictions inherent in our lives.\u000A\u000A After leaving the governor\u0027s office, you spent a lot of time just talking with people like Noam Chomsky and Mother Teresa about the big questions.\u000A\u000A I did. A lot of interesting people.\u000A\u000A What did you learn from Mother Teresa?\u000A\u000A Well, she was a very powerful woman. To be in her presence was a very special kind of privilege. It\u0027s totally different than politics. It\u0027s a different aspect of life. And during my life, I\u0027ve always pursued that path, that you might call religion and spirituality. That\u0027s why I studied to be a priest, why I went to Japan.\u000A\u000A Talk to me about your time in Japan.\u000A\u000A Well, I went to the Jesuit university and I met with Father Lassalle, who was an older Jesuit priest, who I learned later was in Hiroshima when the bomb actually dropped. He was a missionary there. And I asked him about Zen practice and we talked, and I decided to come back and practice Zen meditation. I spent six months with him. It was a time for reflection, for lessening the attachment to ways of thinking, habituated perceptions. You\u0027re able to just sit. I would read and write during the day, and then meditate for two hours at night, and then, once a month, there would be a two-day intensive, and then four times I spent six days at a retreat doing meditation.\u000A\u000A Does that make you better as a political leader?\u000A\u000A I think you can see the arbitrary and subjective quality of one\u0027s own views, one\u0027s own thinking, one\u0027s own desires, as well as everyone else\u0027s. And so I think that fosters a certain amount of compassion. A certain amount of empathy.\u000A\u000A That brings up Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage in 2008.\u000A\u000A What about it?\u000A\u000A It seems like you had a hard time finding your political footing on that.\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t think so.\u000A\u000A You don\u0027t think you changed your position on Prop 8?\u000A\u000A I defended the law as Attorney General.\u000A\u000A You defended it until you challenged it.\u000A\u000A No, I defended the law. And the Supreme Court did not take our position, they struck down the existing statute.\u000A\u000A I\u0027m not asking about the previous statute, I\u0027m asking about Proposition 8. When it passed, you said it was okay.\u000A\u000A No, I didn\u0027t say that.\u000A\u000A You didn\u0027t say that?\u000A\u000A What I said was that the existing law was valid.\u000A\u000A Not the existing law, Proposition 8.\u000A\u000A Which Proposition 8?\u000A\u000A The Proposition 8 that banned gay marriage.\u000A\u000A Oh, okay. Well, we\u0027ve got three things here. We have the existing law. We have the Supreme Court opinion striking down that law. Then we have Proposition 8. Then we have the Supreme Court upholding Proposition 8. And then we have the federal case challenging it. Those are five distinct topics.\u000A\u000A Right. And I\u0027m talking about Proposition 8. When it passed, you said you would defend it because it represented \u0022the will of the people.\u0022\u000A\u000ANo, I didn\u0027t say that.\u000A\u000A You did say that.\u000A\u000ANo. No, I didn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t say that.\u000A\u000A All right.\u000A\u000A Show it to me.\u000A\u000A I will.\u000A\u000A I said that I supported Proposition 8?\u000A\u000A You said that you would defend Prop 8 as Attorney General.\u000A\u000A No, what I said was — I did say something right after it passed. I said that I didn\u0027t think it was a Constitutional revision.\u000A\u000A And then later, you said it was.\u000A\u000A No I didn\u0027t.\u000A\u000A You did. You challenged it in court on Constitutional grounds.\u000A\u000A No I didn\u0027t.\u000A\u000A You didn\u0027t?\u000A\u000A No.\u000A\u000A In December?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t think you\u0027re listening.\u000A\u000A Sure I\u0027m listening.\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t think so. You don\u0027t act like it.\u000A\u000A Just because I\u0027m asking questions doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t hear your answers.\u000A\u000A Well, what did I say?\u000A\u000A You said, \u0022No, I didn\u0027t.\u0022 That was the last thing you said — that you didn\u0027t challenge Proposition 8 on Constitutional grounds. But you did.\u000A\u000A This is. . . relatively. . . I don\u0027t think so. What I said was this. I\u0027m going to say it, and you can disagree if you want. I said I didn\u0027t believe it violated the, uh — I didn\u0027t believe that it was a revision. Then, as our office did more and more research, some of the lawyers said it violates a fundamental right created by the Supreme Court. Based on that, we articulated a pretty novel theory that a fundamental right cannot be swept aside by a mere majority. I hadn\u0027t thought of that when I said it didn\u0027t constitute a revision.\u000A\u000A And that\u0027s what I\u0027m asking about.\u000A\u000A The development of an idea by our lawyers.\u000A\u000A Right, which was very different from what you said originally.\u000A\u000A It was totally different. Totally different. I hadn\u0027t thought of it before.\u000A\u000A What about \u0022determinate sentencing,\u0022 which the rest of us call \u0022mandatory minimums\u0022? As governor, you pushed for the law, but as mayor of Oakland, you tried to repeal it. Why?\u000A\u000A Originally, the hope was that it would minimize the arbitrariness of treating some prisoners differently than others. But the way it turns out, when people know exactly when they\u0027re going to leave prison, the motivation to get into education or therapy is reduced. We also didn\u0027t envision that every year the legislature would say, \u0022We\u0027ve got to make the sentence higher!\u0022 Every year, they keep escalating the determinate sentence, and they have created a much harsher regime than we ever had.\u000A\u000A It seems like your thinking on nuclear power has also evolved over the years. Do you consider yourself open to it now?\u000A\u000A Yeah, I\u0027m open to that. Because of climate change.\u000A\u000A So would you be open to a new nuclear plant in California?\u000A\u000A I would like to see a national policy getting serious about climate change, so that\u0027s one of the alternatives. My advisor on this issue is John Holdren, who is the science advisor to the president, and another fellow named James Lovelock, who says the world needs a thousand nuclear power plants almost immediately to prevent catastrophe. Now, that\u0027s an extreme view, but it\u0027s something that people have to think about. The alternatives to burning carbon have to be taken very, very seriously.\u000A\u000A But I\u0027m asking specifically what you would support as governor?\u000A\u000A Whatever I can.\u000A\u000A Including a new nuclear plant?\u000A\u000A Including anything that\u0027s honest and reasonably effective and doesn\u0027t cause undue damage.\u000A\u000A Do you consider it honest and reasonably effective to build a new nuclear plant in California?\u000A\u000A I would not rule out any reasonable scientific steps to block the impending catastrophe of climate change.\u000A\u000A But you won\u0027t say whether you\u0027re in favor of a new nuclear plant?\u000A\u000A No, I won\u0027t. Because I think I\u0027ve said it very clearly. Very clearly.\u000A\u000A You\u0027ve said that you\u0027re open to anything reasonable, but you haven\u0027t said whether or not a new nuclear plant is reasonable.\u000A\u000A Yeah, that\u0027s right. I\u0027m not a nuclear scientist.\u000A\u000A But you want to be governor - you\u0027ll have to make these decisions.\u000A\u000A I\u0027ll have plenty of time to think about it.\u000A\u000A Will you discuss your position on offshore drilling?\u000A\u000A Yes, because I have a long record on that.\u000A\u000A But you have a record on nuclear power, too. In 1975 you stopped a nuclear plant in San Diego, much to the chagrin of the mayor, Pete Wilson.\u000A\u000A I did, and it saved San Diego because they couldn\u0027t afford it.\u000A\u000A So what\u0027s your position on a new plant now?\u000A\u000A I will weigh all the options and look at it. Being deliberative is not bad.\u000A\u000A Being willing to state your position is not bad either.\u000A\u000A Mindful of slogans is not helpful for governance, and my mind is not such.\u000A\u000A I\u0027m not critiquing your mind, but let\u0027s talk about something else: Proposition 19.\u000A\u000A What is Proposition 19?\u000A\u000A It\u0027s on the ballot this fall to legalize marijuana.\u000A\u000A Oh yeah.\u000A\u000A You\u0027ve said that you oppose legalization.\u000A\u000A Those are your words.\u000A\u000A No, you said that.\u000A\u000A Well, I don\u0027t support the legalization of drugs.\u000A\u000A That\u0027s what I just said.\u000A\u000A Right, okay. I\u0027m just being careful.\u000A\u000A Legalizing pot is a serious issue in California these days. In 2008, the state arrested 60,000 people for possession.\u000A\u000A You know, the number one drug on the street is marijuana. The cartels are increasingly taking over. This is a serious problem.\u000A\u000A Do you think legalization would make that better or worse?\u000A\u000A I\u0027ve given you my position.\u000A\u000AYes, you have. I\u0027m asking you why it\u0027s your position.\u000A\u000AI think it\u0027s more prudent for California not to embrace a legalization strategy.\u000A\u000A Why?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t think fostering chemicals is a smart move.\u000A\u000A Should we illegalize alcohol?\u000A\u000A I think the advertising and the excess of alcohol is a serious problem, and even legal drugs in the form of prescriptions is a serious problem.\u000A\u000A I\u0027ve never heard of a cartel killing somebody over ambien.\u000A\u000A I understand you like pot. I don\u0027t.\u000A\u000A I\u0027m not saying I like pot. I\u0027m saying nobody wants to illegalize alcohol, and I\u0027m asking why pot is different.\u000A\u000A What do we call that? A noble experiment.\u000A\u000A If Prop 19 passes, will you challenge it?\u000A\u000A Generally speaking when a law is passed, the Attorney General defends it.\u000A\u000A But you managed to find a \u0022novel theory\u0022 to challenge Proposition 8.\u000A\u000A I did, but that\u0027s unusual.\u000A\u000A So, would you find a novel theory to challenge Proposition 19?\u000A\u000A You know, I\u0027d want to look at that.\u000A\u000A Let me ask you another question about Prop 8, since we just stumbled back onto it. In 1977, you signed a law that illegalized gay marriage.\u000A\u000A No, I didn\u0027t.\u000A\u000A You changed the law from allowing \u0022two persons\u0022 to get married, to saying \u0022a man and a woman.\u0022 Does it bug you that you signed that?\u000A\u000A No.\u000A\u000A Come on.\u000A\u000A Don\u0027t impute your subjectivity to mine.\u000A\u000A I\u0027m trying to understand yours.\u000A\u000A Well, I\u0027ll tell you. Before I was governor, the law was de-gendered. So where we had \u0022workman\u0027s comp,\u0022 it became \u0022worker\u0027s comp.\u0022 Where it was \u0022firemen,\u0022 it became \u0022firefighters.\u0022 And when it came to marriage, it was between \u0022a man and a woman,\u0022 and it became \u0022two persons.\u0022 But when the legislature did that, they did not intend to legalize same-sex marriage. That was not the intention of the governor, nor was it the intent of the legislature. So I felt that I was upholding the law, and effectuating what the legislature intended.\u000A\u000A But that language has become very important again. Do you think the language should say \u0022two persons\u0022 now?\u000A\u000A I think the debate has evolved, and marriage is of far more significance in the gay community than it was 30 years ago, 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. So it definitely is embedded in the sense of a fundamental right.\u000A\u000A What will you do as governor to help gay couples marry?\u000A\u000A We\u0027ll see what happens. Maybe an initiative comes up, and I would certainly support some measure to change the law.\u000A\u000A Are you willing to fight for gay marriage?\u000A\u000A Certainly if the initiative comes up, I would be counted as a supporter.\u000A\u000A Will you propose an initiative?\u000A\u000A I don\u0027t know. My first goal is the budget. Budget and jobs are my first objectives. But we\u0027re out of time.\u000A\u000A You know you want to spend another hour with me.\u000A\u000A No, I don\u0027t.\u000A\u000A Admit it.\u000A\u000A Nope.\u000A\u000A You love this.\u000A\u000A I want to go somewhere. Get out of town. I work too much.",

A candid GQ+A with Jerry Brown</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".2395jhnqz9c.1.1.0.0.4"><div class="embed noscript" data-reactid=".2395jhnqz9c.1.1.0.0.4.0"><noscript></noscript></div><p data-reactid=".2395jhnqz9c.1.1.0.0.4.1"> He&apos;s back! Thirty-five years ago, Jerry Brown surged into the national spotlight as the doe-eyed young governor of California, with a floppy mop of rumpled hair, a quirky passion for outer space, and some of the earliest initiatives of the coming green revolution. In the span of two terms, between 1975 and 1983, he passed the nation&apos;s first efficiency standards for appliances and homes, made California the global leader in alternative energy (with 90% of the world&apos;s wind power), and set countless new benchmarks for clean air and water, even while presiding over a staggering budget surplus of more than $4 billion. . . that is, until California taxpayers made him give it all back.</p><p data-reactid=".2395jhnqz9c.1.1.0.0.4.2"> In an infamous 1978 referendum known as Proposition 13, voters slashed their property tas, obliterating state revenue and emptying Brown&apos;s coffers overnight. By the time he left office in 1983, the $4 billion surplus had slumped into a billion-dollar deficit, and today, many political analysts trace the state&apos;s financial decline to that first blow on Brown&apos;s watch. Yet the man himself has proven remarkably resilient. In the years since he left Sacramento, he has served as Mayor of Oakland, competed with Bill Clinton for the presidency, and in 2007, returned to statewide office as California&apos;s Attorney General &#x2014; even while traversing the world in his spare time to seek spiritual enlightenment from figures like Mother Teresa and Japanese monks. At one point, he actually disappeared inside a Zen center for six months to meditate about &quot;the essential emptiness.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2395jhnqz9c.1.1.0.0.4.3"> Next month, California voters will choose between Brown and Republican candidate Meg Whitman, the former CEO of eBay. If Brown wins, the 72-year-old will become, by the end of his term, the oldest governor and the longest serving in state history. He will also become the first governor to win a third term since the state made it illegal to serve more than two. (More on that below.) We sat down with the notoriously feisty lifelong pol for two extended sessions, to probe the man nicknamed Governor Moonbeam about his contentious candidacy, his polarizing past, and his grand plan for the ultimate comeback.</p><p data-reactid=".2395jhnqz9c.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>How has this campaign been different than your last run for governor?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2395jhnqz9c.1.1.0.0.4.6"> It started earlier.
