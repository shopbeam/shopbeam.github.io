  	    "articleBody": "see the slideshow\u000A\u000Ait\u0027s a sunny afternoon in late October, and Jennifer Aniston and I are having lunch inside the bright, modern Beverly Hills home she uses as an office, talking about the 24/7 unscripted dramacall it The Jen Showwhose mobile production unit is parked right out front. Arriving for our meeting, I\u0027d watched three paparazzi SUVs speed by, rip some Grand Theft Auto-style doughnuts in the street, and station their vehicles facing downhill, positioned for pursuit. There seem to be about a half-dozen paps outsidea slow day on the set. Last week\u0027s episode, \u0022The One Where Jen and John Mayer Get Back Together,\u0022 drew twenty men who trailed her constantly, jockeying for those exclusive photos of the couple that have fetched as much as $20,000. Today\u0027s crew are just staffers, guys who stalk Aniston full-time for photo agencies like X17.\u000A\u000A\u0022Yesterday I pulled up to one truck and rolled down my window,\u0022 she says, leaning in. \u0022I go, \u0027Let me just ask, this is every day? Every day now? Is there a way we could make this a little bit saner?\u0027 It\u0027s just not human to walk around with twenty cars following youthere\u0027s no ease. Maybe they do want you to get all Mariah Carey on yourself and be put into an institution. I miss the days when they hid in the bushes.\u0022\u000A\u000AThere\u0027s an edge to the way Aniston jokes about the public\u0027s obsession with her life, especially when she describes the ill will she harbors for the anonymous parasites who chronicle the burgers she eats, the gas she pumps, the trash she takes out. At one point, I mention that one of the guys out front has a ladder in the back of his 4Runner. \u0022That\u0027s illegal!\u0022 she snaps. The ladder, if used to peep over her towering hedges, would violate California privacy law. \u0022I hope he hits something.\u0022 She pauses, realizing how that sounds. \u0022It\u0027s terrible when you wish horrible things on other human beings.\u0022\u000A\u000AListening to Jen tear into the tabloid circus is entertaining stuff, and for a moment I marvel at just how lucky I am to be inside the iron gate, eating a delicious, Asian-influenced chicken-and-fried-cheese dish with one of the world\u0027s most sought-after women, a woman who has barely talked to the press in two yearsuntil, that is, I remember that I\u0027ve come to Aniston\u0027s office in large part to ask precisely the same sorts of questionsIs this thing with Mayer really going to last? Are you truly over the divorce? Don\u0027t you just fucking hate Angelina?that the scrum of photographers out front seek to answer with their cameras.\u000A\u000AHuh. I guess we could talk about Halloween or some shit. But isn\u0027t the tabloid stuff all anyone really wants to know?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AAniston has been really famous25-million-viewers-a-week famousfor my entire post-pubescent life. And going into our meeting, I\u0027d been fairly convinced that she\u0027d be too familiar to seem sexy in personthat after years of quirky Rachel Green-esque roles, it\u0027d be impossible to see her as anything but merely cute, or that if America\u0027s Sweetheart did seem sexy, it\u0027d be a Mrs. Robinson thing. Not so. Jen looks at least as young, if not younger, than she did during her Friends days, this despite her looming fortieth birthday. She looks better, toofit and sun kissed as always, but somehow in greater possession of herself and seemingly at ease with her age. \u0022I still can\u0027t wrap my head around how old I\u0027m going to be,\u0022 she says. \u0022I feel more comfortable today than I ever did in my twenties or early thirties. I\u0027m healthier. I\u0027m more at peace in my mind and with my body.\u0022\u000A\u000AThat bodywell, as you can see, it defies both time and nature. I ask Jen how she felt about this cover shoot. \u0022There is a moment when you walk in and see the wardrobeit\u0027s basically a tieand you think, Where\u0027s the underwear?\u0022 she replies with a laugh. \u0022But it felt really good to be that comfortable with myselfand to lie on men as furniture.\u0022\u000A\u000AToday, Jen has a bit more to her wardrobe: jeans, sandals, and a gray tank top so form-fitting that, when she\u0027s photographed wearing it a few weeks later, its snugness to her flat stomach is taken as evidence that she is not, in fact, the future mother of Li\u0027l Johnny Mayer. A few weeks after our interview, she\u0027ll make a cameo on 30 Rock, and all anyone will talk about is the French-maid outfit she wore and how perfect her legs looked draped across Tina Fey\u0027s desk. (On whether or not the 30 Rock stint might become a regular gig, she says: \u0022That, to me, is an ideal job: great cast, New York City. We\u0027ll see what I say if they come back and ask meI wouldn\u0027t say yes, I wouldn\u0027t say no.\u0022)\u000A\u000AAs we finish lunch, she talks about the project she seems most excited about: a movie she\u0027s developing called Pumas, in which she hopes to star with Elizabeth Banks.\u000A\u000A\u0022It\u0027s sort of a female Wedding Crashers,\u0022 she says. \u0022It\u0027s these two girls who are aspiring cougars. It is so a comment on the sexual double standardand what\u0027s been ironic is how hard it\u0027s been to get this movie made. Studios want it, but they\u0027re afraid of Middle America. They\u0027d want to change it; they\u0027re saying, Oh, you can\u0027t do that, people just can\u0027t imagine you\u0022 She\u0027s alluding here to Hollywood\u0027s formula for romantic comedies and her default character within themoffbeat, likable, and unlucky in love. As she talks about Pumas, you get the sense that she\u0027s feeling a little hemmed in by the tabloid ber-narrative that frames her lifethe one in which her failure to remarry and procreate is a cause of Deep and Lasting Sadnessespecially when that false story line gets in the way of her career.\u000A\u000A\u0022Look, I think all women at some level just want to rage against the machine,\u0022 she says. \u0022There are just too many movies out there that don\u0027t empower womenmovies in which their only way of being happy is finding a man. And you know, that\u0027s not my favorite theme.\u0022\u000A\u000ARight. Jen, Brad, Angelinathe \u0022insane Bermuda Triangle,\u0022 as Aniston calls it. She and I spend about twenty minutes swirling around in this vortex, but before you follow us in, I should warn you: You may never make it out. Over the course of this discussion, there are exactly two moments when it feels as though she is offering candid, unselfconscious answers. The first is when I wonder if she has any theories on why, four years after her separation from Pitt, the story keeps selling magazines. She responds swiftly. \u0022The funny thing is that people don\u0027t realize we all go away to the Hamptons on the weekends.\u0022\u000A\u000AYeah?\u000A\u000A\u0022No. But can you imagine? That\u0027d be hysterical: I\u0027ve got Zahara on my hip, and Knox?\u0022\u000A\u000ALater, after she describes her current relationship with Pitt (\u0022We don\u0027t not talk. When there\u0027s something to congratulate or celebrate, there\u0027s always an exchange. But there\u0027s no charge on it\u0022), I ask whether she ever speaks to Jolie.\u000A\u000A\u0022No. Nuh-uh,\u0022 she says immediatelyand then, as if to sweeten the message, offers a forced little tongue-biting grin.\u000A\u000ABeyond that, her words are carefully measured. There are trains of thought that begin, then stall, then ultimately halt in smiling demurrals; requests to answer with the tape recorder turned off; facial expressions that say: I may not be answering, but, well, you can probably guess the answer. It\u0027s all weirdly tantalizing. At one point, I ask her about some recent tabloid headlinesangelina stabs jen in the heartand whether she truly was surprised when Jolie said she can\u0027t wait to show her kids Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith because \u0022not a lot of people get to see a movie where their parents fell in love.\u0022 (In the event that you\u0027ve had better things to do, this was the first time Jolie had publicly acknowledged that her love for Pitt began before his marriage to Aniston ended.)\u000A\u000AIt takes her seven days to fully answer. First she says, \u0022Well, you know, that was definitely a confirmation for me of something that wasn\u0027t quite confirmed at the time. But listenyou sit there and you No. No daggers through the heart. I laugh. Am I surprised? Well, how do I say this?\u0022 Then she goes off-the-record for several minutes. Finally, a week later, she calls to deliver an on-the-record statement that\u0027s brief but not without bite: \u0022Considering the source, nothing surprises me.\u0022 She then spends a good deal of time talking about how hard she\u0027s finding it to talk about Jolie after years of silence, this despite having given her now infamous (if hilariously understated) \u0022That was really uncool\u0022 comment to Vogue a few weeks earlier.\u000A\u000ASo what to make of \u0022The One Where Jen Lashes Out for the Second Time in the Six Weeks Leading Up to Her New Film!\u0022? Well, for starters, consider that \u0022what Jen really thinks\u0022 is a commodity worth millions in pre-opening box-office publicity. To believe that Aniston would be in any way cavalier about how she doles it out is to deny her the credit she deserves. Of course she\u0027s aware that this \u0022Considering the source\u0022 jab will be all over the tabloids. Of course she knows that when she answers a question like \u0022Would you ever sell your baby photos to People?\u0022 (\u0022No way, that\u0027s just not somethingno\u0022), she\u0027s also commenting on her rival.\u000A\u000ABut calculation and sincerity aren\u0027t mutually exclusive, and I have no doubt that Aniston\u0027s answers are genuine. In fact, after hearing her speak off-the-record, if only briefly, on the whole Pitt-Jolie saga, let\u0027s just settle it like this: How Jen feels about Angelina is pretty much exactly how you\u0027d think she\u0027d feel.\u000A\u000ANow can we please discuss the work? Aniston has two big movies coming out soon: He\u0027s Just Not That Into You, an ensemble comedy about women struggling to find love that\u0027s due out, depressingly, around Valentine\u0027s Day, and this month\u0027s Marley &amp; Me, in which she stars with Owen Wilsona surprisingly touching movie about a family, their yellow Lab, and mortality. \u0022I just loved the portrait of a marriage, seeing this couple over a span of fifteen years,\u0022 she says of Marley &amp; Me. \u0022You have expectationsit\u0027s all exciting when you\u0027re young and your dreams are big and everything\u0027s ahead of you, and then things don\u0027t always happen the way you expect them to happen and it\u0027s painful.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s statements like this that make interviewing Aniston such a bizarre experience. Our entire conversation seems to take place on two distinct levels. On one, it\u0027s just Jen and mea friendly chat between a journalist and an extremely warm and gracious actress who\u0027s simply talking about her latest film. But she is simultaneously speaking right past me, to the Oprah-watching, US Weekly-reading, movie-ticket-buying public who will interpret her remarks, once they reach the gossip ether, as a sign that her performance in Marley &amp; Me is yet another episode in The Jen Showone surely not to be missed. She herself does nothing to discourage that very conclusion: \u0022My movies always seem to come at the right times. If this role had come to me a couple of years ago, I don\u0027t think I would\u0027ve been able to do it.\u0022\u000A\u000AAfter lunch, we move into the living room, where Jen poses with yogi-perfect posture atop a fantastically shagged white carpet while I slouch against an armchair and ask whether she\u0027ll talk about Mayer.\u000A\u000A\u0022Of course,\u0022 she says cheerfully. \u0022I\u0027ll discuss certain things about my private life to a point, but other things are just nobody\u0027s business.\u0022\u000A\u000ASo what\u0027s the deal with you two?\u000A\u000A\u0022We care deeply for each other, and we\u0027re just trying to figure it out.\u0022\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re not having his baby, then.\u000A\u000A\u0022I am not having his baby. And I have not popped the question.\u0022\u000A\u000AWere you a fan of his music before you started dating?\u000A\u000A\u0022Honestly, I did not know much about him before I met him. I\u0027d heardyou know, uh, \u0027Your Body\u0027that song. But what I can say is that I had no idea what an extraordinary musician he is. And it\u0027s just great to sit and be witness to that. It\u0027s kind of like, Whoa!?\u0022\u000A\u000AIn August, when Aniston and Mayer took some time off, there was widespread speculation that the split was, in part, because Mayer had been too loose-lipped about their relationship. He\u0027s a blogger and prone to speaking directly to paparazzi and gossip reporters, which is something Jen avoids. There are rumors that one of the conditions of the two of them getting back together is that Mayer cuts back on the public proclamations, so I ask her:\u000A\u000AIt seems like John is a fairly self-aware guy and that he enjoys managing his own persona more than the typical celebrityso you see him blogging or\u000A\u000A\u0022Not lately, have you?\u0022\u000A\u000AUh, no. Not recently. Why?\u000A\u000A\u0022Just&amp;things change.\u0022\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s almost time to goJen\u0027s expected just down the street at the new house she\u0027s building for herself, a Balinese-inspired haven that rests on the prow of a hill overlooking West Hollywood. But before I leave, I have to ask about what shereferring earlier to the photo of her and the half-naked dudesdescribed as \u0022sort of a cougar thing.\u0022 Her friend Courteney Cox has just announced a TV show called Cougar Town, there\u0027s that Pumas movie, and of course, the younger man. Sure, it all seems a little heavy-handed, but if Jen\u0027s trying to signal that in the next episode of her life she\u0027ll play a fortysomething sex symbol, well, we\u0027re certainly not going to complain.\u000A\u000ASo what gives? Do she and her friends honestly see themselves that way?\u000A\u000A\u0022No. Not at all,\u0022 she says with a laugh. \u0022First of all, you need to be 40. It\u0027s not like we\u0027re saying, \u0027Oh, you snagged yourself a young one.\u0027?\u0022 But then she pauses, as if there\u0027s maybe at least a little something to it. \u0022Look,\u0022 she says. \u0022I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything wrong with living by your own rulesyou know, whatever blows your hair back.\u0022\u000A\u000AJen gives me a hug, and I walk out of the house, down the driveway, and through the iron gate. Across the street, five paparazzi stand atop their SUVs, cameras ready; another three lie in ambush in the hedges right outside the gate. I get into my car and drive just a little up the street to a place where I can watch their quarry flee.\u000A\u000AA white van filled with tourists on a tour of movie stars\u0027 homes cruises past, then a Honda Pilot with a cameraman surfing on its roof, then a gigantic black Suburban. (I can\u0027t tell whether it\u0027s part of Aniston\u0027s security detail or some sort of paparazzi mother ship.) After about fifteen minutes, the Beverly Hills P.D. arrives to shoo the paps down off their vehicles and, finally, Jen backs out of the driveway.\u000A\u000AThe chase is on! But it\u0027s an absurd one: six SUVs and a cop car trailing a Prius two-tenths of a mile down the street. By the time I even start my engine, Aniston has already arrived at her new place, unscathed and unphotographed. Not so lucky is the guy with the ladder in back of his 4Runner. Halfway down the hill, in hot pursuit, he loses control of his vehicle, careens into the neighbor\u0027s mailbox, and thenjust as Jen had hopedcrashes into a tree.\u000A\u000Amark kirby is a GQ senior editor.",

But <strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong> is in control (does that look like a body under duress?), overhauling her image (she&#39;s ready to play a cougar!), and getting what she needs from a notorious swordsman eight years her junior (not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that)</h2><div class="body-text" data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.0"><a href="../gallery/lordy-lordy-this-woman-is-40">see the slideshow</a></p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.1">it&apos;s a sunny afternoon in late October, and Jennifer Aniston and I are having lunch inside the bright, modern Beverly Hills home she uses as an office, talking about the 24/7 unscripted dramacall it <em>The Jen Show</em>whose mobile production unit is parked right out front. Arriving for our meeting, I&apos;d watched three paparazzi SUVs speed by, rip some <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>-style doughnuts in the street, and station their vehicles facing downhill, positioned for pursuit. There seem to be about a half-dozen paps outsidea slow day on the set. Last week&apos;s episode, &quot;The One Where Jen and John Mayer Get Back Together,&quot; drew twenty men who trailed her constantly, jockeying for those exclusive photos of the couple that have fetched as much as $20,000. Today&apos;s crew are just staffers, guys who stalk Aniston full-time for photo agencies like X17.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.2">&quot;Yesterday I pulled up to one truck and rolled down my window,&quot; she says, leaning in. &quot;I go, &apos;Let me just ask, this is every day? <em>Every</em> day now? Is there a way we could make this a little bit saner?&apos; It&apos;s just not human to walk around with twenty cars following youthere&apos;s no ease. Maybe they <em>do</em> want you to get all Mariah Carey on yourself and be put into an institution. I miss the days when they hid in the bushes.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.3">There&apos;s an edge to the way Aniston jokes about the public&apos;s obsession with her life, especially when she describes the ill will she harbors for the anonymous parasites who chronicle the burgers she eats, the gas she pumps, the trash she takes out. At one point, I mention that one of the guys out front has a ladder in the back of his 4Runner. &quot;That&apos;s illegal!&quot; she snaps. The ladder, if used to peep over her towering hedges, would violate California privacy law. &quot;I hope he hits something.&quot; She pauses, realizing how that sounds. &quot;It&apos;s terrible when you wish horrible things on other human beings.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.5">Listening to Jen tear into the tabloid circus is entertaining stuff, and for a moment I marvel at just how<em> lucky</em> I am to be <em>inside </em>the iron gate, eating a delicious, Asian-influenced chicken-and-fried-cheese dish with one of the world&apos;s most sought-after women, a woman who has barely talked to the press in two yearsuntil, that is, I remember that I&apos;ve come to Aniston&apos;s office in large part to ask precisely the same sorts of questionsIs this thing with Mayer really going to last? Are you truly over the divorce? Don&apos;t you just <em>fucking hate </em>Angelina?that the scrum of photographers out front seek to answer with their cameras.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.6">Huh. I guess we could talk about Halloween or some shit. But isn&apos;t the tabloid stuff all anyone really wants to know?</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.7"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.8">Aniston has been <em>really</em> famous25-million-viewers-a-week famousfor my entire post-pubescent life. And going into our meeting, I&apos;d been fairly convinced that she&apos;d be too familiar to seem sexy in personthat after years of quirky Rachel Green-esque roles, it&apos;d be impossible to see her as anything but merely cute, or that if America&apos;s Sweetheart <em>did</em> seem sexy, it&apos;d be a Mrs. Robinson thing. Not so. Jen looks at least as young, if not younger, than she did during her <em>Friends</em> days, this despite her looming fortieth birthday. She looks <em>better</em>, toofit and sun kissed as always, but somehow in greater possession of herself and seemingly at ease with her age. &quot;I still can&apos;t wrap my head around how old I&apos;m going to be,&quot; she says. &quot;I feel more comfortable today than I ever did in my twenties or early thirties. I&apos;m healthier. I&apos;m more at peace in my mind and with my body.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.9">That bodywell, as you can see, it defies both time and nature. I ask Jen how she felt about this cover shoot. &quot;There is a moment when you walk in and see the wardrobeit&apos;s basically a tieand you think, Where&apos;s the underwear?&quot; she replies with a laugh. &quot;But it felt really good to be that comfortable with myselfand to lie on men as furniture.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.a">Today, Jen has a bit more to her wardrobe: jeans, sandals, and a gray tank top so form-fitting that, when she&apos;s photographed wearing it a few weeks later, its snugness to her flat stomach is taken as evidence that she is not, in fact, the future mother of Li&apos;l Johnny Mayer. A few weeks after our interview, she&apos;ll make a cameo on <em>30 Rock</em>, and all anyone will talk about is the French-maid outfit she wore and how perfect her legs looked draped across Tina Fey&apos;s desk. (On whether or not the 30 Rock stint might become a regular gig, she says: &quot;That, to me, is an ideal job: great cast, New York City. We&apos;ll see what I say if they come back and ask meI wouldn&apos;t say yes, I wouldn&apos;t say no.&quot;)</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.b">As we finish lunch, she talks about the project she seems most excited about: a movie she&apos;s developing called <em>Pumas</em>, in which she hopes to star with Elizabeth Banks.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.c">&quot;It&apos;s sort of a female <em>Wedding Crashers</em>,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s these two girls who are aspiring cougars. It is so a comment on the sexual double standardand what&apos;s been ironic is how hard it&apos;s been to get this movie made. Studios want it, but they&apos;re afraid of Middle America. They&apos;d want to change it; they&apos;re saying, <em>Oh, you can&apos;t do that, people just can&apos;t imagine you</em>&quot; She&apos;s alluding here to Hollywood&apos;s formula for romantic comedies and her default character within themoffbeat, likable, and unlucky in love. As she talks about Pumas, you get the sense that she&apos;s feeling a little hemmed in by the tabloid ber-narrative that frames her lifethe one in which her failure to remarry and procreate is a cause of Deep and Lasting Sadnessespecially when that false story line gets in the way of her career.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.d">&quot;Look, I think all women at some level just want to rage against the machine,&quot; she says. &quot;There are just too many movies out there that don&apos;t empower womenmovies in which their only way of being happy is finding a man. And you know, that&apos;s not my favorite theme.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.e">Right. Jen, Brad, Angelinathe &quot;insane Bermuda Triangle,&quot; as Aniston calls it. She and I spend about twenty minutes swirling around in this vortex, but before you follow us in, I should warn you: You may never make it out. Over the course of this discussion, there are exactly two moments when it feels as though she is offering candid, unselfconscious answers. The first is when I wonder if she has any theories on why, <em>four years</em> after her separation from Pitt, the story keeps selling magazines. She responds swiftly. &quot;The funny thing is that people don&apos;t realize we all go away to the Hamptons on the weekends.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.f">Yeah?</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.g">&quot;No. But can you imagine? That&apos;d be hysterical: I&apos;ve got Zahara on my hip, and Knox?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.h">Later, after she describes her current relationship with Pitt (&quot;We don&apos;t <em>not</em> talk. When there&apos;s something to congratulate or celebrate, there&apos;s always an exchange. But there&apos;s no charge on it&quot;), I ask whether she ever speaks to Jolie.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.i">&quot;No. Nuh-uh,&quot; she says immediatelyand then, as if to sweeten the message, offers a forced little tongue-biting grin.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.j">Beyond that, her words are carefully measured. There are trains of thought that begin, then stall, then ultimately halt in smiling demurrals; requests to answer with the tape recorder turned off; facial expressions that say: I may not be answering, but, well,<em> you can probably guess the answer.</em> It&apos;s all weirdly tantalizing. At one point, I ask her about some recent tabloid headlinesangelina stabs jen in the heartand whether she truly was surprised when Jolie said she can&apos;t wait to show her kids <em>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith</em> because &quot;not a lot of people get to see a movie where their parents fell in love.&quot; (In the event that you&apos;ve had better things to do, this was the first time Jolie had publicly acknowledged that her love for Pitt began before his marriage to Aniston ended.)</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.k">It takes her seven days to fully answer. First she says, &quot;Well, you know, that was definitely a confirmation for me of something that wasn&apos;t quite confirmed at the time. But listenyou sit there and you No. No daggers through the heart. I laugh. Am I surprised? Well, how do I say <em>this</em>?&quot; Then she goes off-the-record for several minutes. Finally, a week later, she calls to deliver an on-the-record statement that&apos;s brief but not without bite: &quot;Considering the source, nothing surprises me.&quot; She then spends a good deal of time talking about how hard she&apos;s finding it to talk about Jolie after years of silence, this despite having given her now infamous (if hilariously understated) &quot;That was really uncool&quot; comment to <em>Vogue</em> a few weeks earlier.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.l">So what to make of &quot;The One Where Jen Lashes Out for the Second Time in the Six Weeks Leading Up to Her New Film!&quot;? Well, for starters, consider that &quot;what Jen really thinks&quot; is a commodity worth millions in pre-opening box-office publicity. To believe that Aniston would be in any way cavalier about how she doles it out is to deny her the credit she deserves. <em>Of course</em> she&apos;s aware that this &quot;Considering the source&quot; jab will be all over the tabloids. <em>Of course</em> she knows that when she answers a question like &quot;Would you ever sell your baby photos to People?&quot; (&quot;No way, that&apos;s just not somethingno&quot;), she&apos;s also commenting on her rival.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.m">But calculation and sincerity aren&apos;t mutually exclusive, and I have no doubt that Aniston&apos;s answers are genuine. In fact, after hearing her speak off-the-record, if only briefly, on the whole Pitt-Jolie saga, let&apos;s just settle it like this: How Jen feels about Angelina is pretty much exactly how you&apos;d think she&apos;d feel.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.n">Now can we please discuss the work? Aniston has two big movies coming out soon: <em>He&apos;s Just Not That Into You</em>, an ensemble comedy about women struggling to find love that&apos;s due out, depressingly, around Valentine&apos;s Day, and this month&apos;s <em>Marley &amp; Me</em>, in which she stars with Owen Wilsona surprisingly touching movie about a family, their yellow Lab, and mortality. &quot;I just loved the portrait of a marriage, seeing this couple over a span of fifteen years,&quot; she says of <em>Marley &amp; Me</em>. &quot;You have expectationsit&apos;s all exciting when you&apos;re young and your dreams are big and everything&apos;s ahead of you, and then things don&apos;t always happen the way you expect them to happen and it&apos;s painful.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.o">It&apos;s statements like this that make interviewing Aniston such a bizarre experience. Our entire conversation seems to take place on two distinct levels. On one, it&apos;s just Jen and mea friendly chat between a journalist and an extremely warm and gracious actress who&apos;s simply talking about her latest film. But she is simultaneously speaking right past me, to the Oprah-watching, <em>US Weekly</em>-reading, movie-ticket-buying public who will interpret her remarks, once they reach the gossip ether, as a sign that her performance in <em>Marley &amp; Me</em> is yet another episode in The Jen Showone surely not to be missed. She herself does nothing to discourage that very conclusion: &quot;My movies always seem to come at the right times. If this role had come to me a couple of years ago, I don&apos;t think I would&apos;ve been able to do it.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.p">After lunch, we move into the living room, where Jen poses with yogi-perfect posture atop a fantastically shagged white carpet while I slouch against an armchair and ask whether she&apos;ll talk about Mayer.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.q">&quot;Of course,&quot; she says cheerfully. &quot;I&apos;ll discuss certain things about my private life to a point, but other things are just nobody&apos;s business.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.r"><em>So what&apos;s the deal with you two?</em></p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.s">&quot;We care deeply for each other, and we&apos;re just trying to figure it out.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.t"><em>You&apos;re not having his baby, then.</em></p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.u">&quot;I am not having his baby. And I have not popped the question.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.v"><em>Were you a fan of his music before you started dating?</em></p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.w">&quot;Honestly, I did not know much about him before I met him. I&apos;d heardyou know, uh, &apos;Your Body&apos;<em>that song</em>. But what I can say is that I had no idea what an extraordinary musician he is. And it&apos;s just great to sit and be witness to that. It&apos;s kind of like, <em>Whoa!</em>?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.x">In August, when Aniston and Mayer took some time off, there was widespread speculation that the split was, in part, because Mayer had been too loose-lipped about their relationship. He&apos;s a blogger and prone to speaking directly to paparazzi and gossip reporters, which is something Jen avoids. There are rumors that one of the conditions of the two of them getting back together is that Mayer cuts back on the public proclamations, so I ask her:</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.y"><em>It seems like John is a fairly self-aware guy and that he enjoys managing his own persona more than the typical celebrityso you see him blogging or</em></p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.z">&quot;Not lately, have you?&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.10"><em>Uh, no. Not recently. Why?</em></p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.11">&quot;Just&amp;things change.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.12">It&apos;s almost time to goJen&apos;s expected just down the street at the new house she&apos;s building for herself, a Balinese-inspired haven that rests on the prow of a hill overlooking West Hollywood. But before I leave, I have to ask about what shereferring earlier to the photo of her and the half-naked dudesdescribed as &quot;sort of a cougar thing.&quot; Her friend Courteney Cox has just announced a TV show called <em>Cougar Town</em>, there&apos;s that Pumas movie, and of course, the younger man. Sure, it all seems a little heavy-handed, but if Jen&apos;s trying to signal that in the next episode of her life she&apos;ll play a fortysomething sex symbol, well, <em>we&apos;re certainly</em> not going to complain.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.13">So what gives? Do she and her friends honestly see themselves that way?</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.14">&quot;No. Not at all,&quot; she says with a laugh. &quot;First of all, you need to be 40. It&apos;s not like we&apos;re saying, &apos;Oh, you snagged yourself a<em> young</em> one.&apos;?&quot; But then she pauses, as if there&apos;s maybe at least a little something to it. &quot;Look,&quot; she says. &quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything wrong with living by your own rulesyou know, whatever blows your hair back.&quot;</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.15">Jen gives me a hug, and I walk out of the house, down the driveway, and through the iron gate. Across the street, five paparazzi stand atop their SUVs, cameras ready; another three lie in ambush in the hedges right outside the gate. I get into my car and drive just a little up the street to a place where I can watch their quarry flee.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.16">A white van filled with tourists on a tour of movie stars&apos; homes cruises past, then a Honda Pilot with a cameraman surfing on its roof, then a gigantic black Suburban. (I can&apos;t tell whether it&apos;s part of Aniston&apos;s security detail or some sort of paparazzi mother ship.) After about fifteen minutes, the Beverly Hills P.D. arrives to shoo the paps down off their vehicles and, finally, Jen backs out of the driveway.</p><p data-reactid=".2clwlza2ry8.1.1.0.0.4.17"><em>The chase is on!</em> But it&apos;s an absurd one: six SUVs and a cop car trailing a Prius two-tenths of a mile down the street. By the time I even start my engine, Aniston has already arrived at her new place, unscathed and unphotographed. Not so lucky is the guy with the ladder in back of his 4Runner. Halfway down the hill, in hot pursuit, he loses control of his vehicle, careens into the neighbor&apos;s mailbox, and thenjust as Jen had hopedcrashes into a tree.</p><p
