  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterestGetty Images\u000A\u000AMatt Towery, 53, is an Atlanta-based pollster for InsiderAdvantage and former top Gingrich aide who still has a D.C. cell phone number. He\u0027s been one of Newt\u0027s closest pals for three decades, and, like Gingrich, he loves to talk. Below, Towery says some things—about Newt\u0027s second marriage, idiotic campaign consultants, what\u0027s really going to happen in Florida, and his own admiration for Obama—that he knows might get him \u0022shot.\u0022\u000A\u000AGQ: How long have you known Newt Gingrich?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: [Laughs] My relationship with Newt Gingrich is thirty years long. In the early 1980s I worked for Mack Mattingly, the U.S. Senator from Georgia. I was on his payroll. But I had helped Newt in three debates that he had in 1980. I had won the national bicentennial debate championship. So Newt asked me to help him, because I helped his daughter in a debate workshop. And over the years, I stayed in touch with him. I knew Newt Gingrich through all these times that everyone is talking about.\u000A\u000AGQ: How would you describe your friendship?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: It\u0027s two fists in each other\u0027s face. I won\u0027t put up with his bull. And he won\u0027t put up with mine. I\u0027m not very nice to him, by the way. I\u0027m the only person in the world who stands up to him and just beats him up. I\u0027m probably the only person in America who will tell Newt Gingrich \u0022Your pants are down\u0022 or whatever. I have to tell you, Newt has changed. He\u0027s a different person.\u000A\u000AGQ: How so?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: Much kinder. Much more caring. Not the mean-spirited type folks thought.\u000A\u000AGQ: So he was indeed mean-spirited?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: No, no. I\u0027m not saying that. That\u0027s just what people thought. He was tough. And, you know, I was one of the few who was tough enough to fight him back. And I think that\u0027s why our friendship has endured 30 plus years. He was never mean. He was always thoughtful. But he\u0027s turned into someone who\u0027s almost soft.\u000A\u000AGQ: In his debate performances he doesn\u0027t appear to be soft.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: I know that. Yes. I\u0027m not that stupid. I mean, in debates he debates. He\u0027s the king of debating. But, in his personal life, in personal dealing with us, I\u0027ve seen a huge difference. I would not even talk to him now if he were the guy from 1990.\u000A\u000AGQ: Because in 1990...he was what?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery:Tough. But I was tough, too. The two of us fought like animals.\u000A\u000AGQ: You speak regularly? Do you still give him advice?\u000A\u000ATowery: I give him the polling numbers. And I tell him what I\u0027m thinking. But, you\u0027ve gotta understand that I\u0027d do that for Romney if he called me. I\u0027m sort of an even broker. My firm\u0027s reputation is far more important to me than Newt. And we were the first in South Carolina to show Newt up. But what people don\u0027t realize is we were also the first to show him down. So, you know, I\u0027m not . . . Newt does not consider me someone that he has in his pocket.\u000A\u000AGQ: Was it surprising to you that he took South Carolina as easily as he did?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: I thought he\u0027d win by five percent. I could not believe that number.\u000A\u000AGQ: Do you think he believed that number?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: Now, yes. But not then. I went down the aisle with him. I was right behind him. And it was overwhelming. The Gingrich people booked the Hilton when they thought they were gonna lose. Because the room was overcrowded, overwhelmed. It was probably a thousand people trying to get into a 250-person room. And, quite frankly — I\u0027ll say this on the record —I was fearing for his life. People were reaching in left and right and I thought, my goodness, this could be Bobby Kennedy all over again.\u000A\u000AGQ: And he\u0027s surrounded by bodyguards.\u000A\u000ATowery: Sort of.\u000A\u000AGQ: How big a guy is he?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: Newt? Huge. I mean, come on, let\u0027s not play around. He\u0027s big. Too big. He\u0027s always been that big.\u000A\u000AGQ: You\u0027ve written that he \u0022has only one enemy, himself.\u0022 How is he his own worst enemy?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: He talks too much. He says too many things. And when he does that, it hurts him. That\u0027s his Achilles heel.\u000A\u000AGQ: How about his competition?\u000A\u000ATowery: Romney is, to me, a very attractive candidate. But he\u0027s extremely plastic. And he is run by the too-cool-for-school crowd. And they make people upset. I think that Newt has sort of gotten into that groove even though Newt, normally, would not have understood that was the groove he was getting into. I mean, Newt was in D.C. for a long time. He\u0027s no neophyte. But now, all of a sudden, he\u0027s the outsider.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: Did the allegations from his ex-wife surprise you?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: No. I\u0027m gonna tell you more about that than anybody else will, and I\u0027ll just be shot, okay? I knew Marianne from 1981 on. I liked her. She was a friend of mine. But that marriage was severely flawed from 1990 on. And Marianne did not tell the truth.\u000A\u000AGQ: She didn\u0027t tell the truth in that instance?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A She did not tell the truth about the marriage.\u000A\u000AGQ: Regarding the open marriage question?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Regarding everything.\u000A\u000AGQ: What were her motives? Bitterness?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: Yes. And I feel for her. In the sense that Marianne does feel left behind. But Marianne was a . . . I\u0027ll say it, on the record . . . when he was speaker, she was a mean-spirited nasty person who took advantage of Newt being speaker.\u000A\u000AGQ: Took advantage in what way?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: Every way possible. Tickets to shows, telling Newt to do this that and the other. She was a nasty person. And she did not own up to her own failings.\u000A\u000AGQ: So the marriage was doomed?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: It\u0027s a sham. A sham.\u000A\u000AGQ: But they stayed together for how many years?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: Whatever a sham can take.\u000A\u000AGQ: Is this the worst field of Republican candidates you\u0027ve seen in a while?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: The worst were four years ago. John McCain, who was worthless. Huckabee, who was a great guy, but could not get traction. Guiliani, who was fatally flawed. A terrible group. I think this group is actually pretty good.\u000A\u000AGQ: Really, because in a piece you wrote . . .\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: I know, I know. I wrote it. But if you read that piece, I\u0027m talking about their consultants. The consultants suck. They are neophytes. They\u0027re idiots. And they don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing. And if they stay this course, Barack Obama will be reelected. They are children.\u000A\u000AGQ: And you wrote that they\u0027re not \u0022honest brokers,\u0022 these candidates.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: Yeah, they\u0027re all being told to say stuff that\u0027s not true. We need these candidates to be run by the professionals that know what they\u0027re saying. Where are the Ed Rollins\u0027s, the . . . Atwater is gone, but . . . where are the folks that can run these campaigns? Jimmy Carville, who by the way is one of my favorite people, knows how to run a campaign. These folks don\u0027t. They\u0027re neophytes. The folks running the Romney campaign are too cool for school, and the folks running the Gingrich campaign, they don\u0027t know what they\u0027re doing.\u000A\u000AGQ: And you\u0027ve said as much to Newt?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: I have.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AGQ: Did Gingrich\u0027s debate performances in Florida surprise you?\u000A\u000A Towery: Yeah, I was totally surprised. I think he was too tired. I had a chance to look over his schedule in Florida last night, and I\u0027ve never seen a candidate so over-scheduled. I can\u0027t tell you how many events, but there was never any down time. Just one thing to the next, next, next, next. If you\u0027re doing that and then debating, you just have no hope. I think he went into the first debate sort of feeling that he was on top, and not prepared for Romney being sharper. The second debate, he had two problems: he was tired, and Wolf Blitzer ran that thing beautifully. So Gingrich wasn\u0027t able to pull his usual media castigation. The debate was run very tightly. And that didn\u0027t meet his sort of more rambling style.\u000A\u000AGQ: What\u0027s the vibe like around the Gingrich campaign right now?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: I wouldn\u0027t know. I\u0027m over at Disney World. [Laughs] I\u0027ve been around these things too long to want to be around all that crap. I\u0027ll be over there tonight. Today, my fianc&amp;#xC3;&amp;#xA9;e and I are going to go and ride a couple rides over in Epcot.\u000A\u000AGQ: Knowing Newt as well as you do, do you think he\u0027s privately optimistic?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: He\u0027s always privately optimistic, but I think he\u0027s also probably realistic. I don\u0027t think he thinks he\u0027s going to win Florida, although he thinks probably there\u0027s some potential for an upset. I think that they\u0027re ready to map a strategy beyond Florida, and that he really is looking—this is just my guess —at what has taken place here, over the last four to five days, and trying to figure out how he can capture that in a bottle and take it to some of these other similar states. Georgia, Tennessee, Alaska, maybe even Ohio. I don\u0027t think they have a lot of hope on these caucuses, because they\u0027re just too quick and too well-organized by the candidacies.\u000A\u000AGQ: What\u0027s happened over the past four to five days?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: He got more aggressive, his ads went up, and I think they\u0027ve learned the value of having the money in place to buy the ads. I think there has also been sort of a coalescing of some conservative figures who have .... in their mind, there\u0027s not just a Democratic elite, there\u0027s a conservative elite. And it\u0027s made up of a lot of folks who generally stay in Washington all the time. But who nevertheless are very influential in their writings. You look at an Ann Coulter, for example. I mean, fine writer. But I haven\u0027t seen her name on a ballot ever. You look at Charles Krauthammer: extremely brilliant guy, but I don\u0027t think he\u0027s been out of a Washington, D.C. studio in years. George Will: same thing. Almost all of these people...in their minds, suspiciously at once, began to beat Newt to a bloody pulp. It\u0027s sort of a good thing, because these are just writers. It caused the Gingrich campaign to reach out to people like Fred Thompson, and to Sarah Palin, and to Herman Cain. And say, Look, these are not your friends, these are the same people who put you down. So he\u0027s got the beginnings of an Us-vs.-Them campaign. Which is what he\u0027s gonna need if he\u0027s gonna keep Romney from getting enough delegates to win this thing on the first ballot... Look, we\u0027re headed towards a brokered convention. And people don\u0027t realize that. This thing will not be decided. Romney is too strong and Gingrich is too popular.\u000A\u000AGQ: Where do you have Gingrich polling at this moment?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: We last polled Sunday night and we had him down six points. You could say, Wow, that\u0027s a hell of a lot different from being down twenty. Anybody could be wrong: Florida is very hard to peg. But I pegged it for Politico in 2008, when I had Obama winning by one. The reason I think it might be a little closer for Newt is that ours was the only poll to poll just on the 29th, which was after the endorsement by Cain and Sarah Palin did her thing. In South Carolina, it was the Palin thing that really bucked Newt up. I hate to put so much stock in one person, but she does have an effect. Particularly on men. Our poll showed that Newt had pulled away from Romney on men. But he was getting slaughtered among women. That slaughter I attribute partly to some of the rather grandiose statements he made: saying we\u0027re going to colonize the moon doesn\u0027t appeal to female voters. They want to think their president will be a strong stable person—not that he\u0027s not, but he\u0027s being portrayed as unstable. At least in these television commercials.\u000A\u000AGQ: So do you think the race has tightened at all since Sunday night?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: It could have tightened or it could have expanded back out. But I don\u0027t think this is going to be a 15 point blow-out. The exit polls may show that, but I don\u0027t put much faith in exit polls. The intensity of people who are for him is pretty high.\u000A\u000AGQ: What\u0027s going to happen in the general?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: Barack Obama is by far stronger than any Republican thinks. They do not understand how strong this guy is. He\u0027s a great debater. The economy will start to improve. And people do not understand why he is \u0022unelectable.\u0022 And I believe that, in the end, Barack Obama will be . . . a stronger force than any Republican thinks. And I polled this thing for Politico . . . I know that they don\u0027t use me now, but I was right in every poll I did. I had North Carolina going for Barack Obama. Florida going for Barack Obama. Georgia at 48 percent. I was an honest broker. I think this thing will be right back where it was back four years ago.\u000A\u000AGQ: So you think Obama will win again?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: I\u0027m not saying that. I think it will be very tight. But I think that people who think Barack Obama is finished are nuts. I . . . let me tell you, there are some nights when I would vote for Barack Obama. I mean, I\u0027m not right wing nut. I make my decisions based on what I see. And this guy is going to be much stronger. They are underestimating him and they are writing him off to history, and that\u0027s a mistake.\u000A\u000AGQ: Who would you vote for today?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: I wouldn\u0027t vote. I never do. But who would I say would win today? Barack Obama.\u000A\u000AGQ: Does Gingrich have as good a chance as Romney to beat Obama?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: I think he actually has a better chance, because he has passion. Either one has a good chance. But the problem is: Obama is so smart and so good. I mean, these guys underestimate his organization, his ability, the advantage someone has as president. Let\u0027s put it this way: I used to be a politician and I wouldn\u0027t run against him.\u000A\u000AGQ: Yeah, he has a lot of intangibles.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000A Towery: Yes. They all write him off, and I don\u0027t. I\u0027ve been around for a long, long time and I do not put people down because of their party. I actually respect President Obama. And I\u0027m probably one of the few people who is Republican who does. The man took on an incredibly disastrous situation. He\u0027s very strong. He\u0027s a smart guy. He\u0027s no dummy. Look, I respect him immensely. He\u0027s the President of the United States.\u000A\u000ACharles Bethea is a contributing writer to Atlanta Magazine.",

He&#x2019;s been one of Newt&#x2019;s closest pals for three decades, and, like Gingrich, he loves to talk. Below, Towery says some things&#x2014;about Newt&#x2019;s second marriage, idiotic campaign consultants, what&#x2019;s really going to happen in Florida, and his own admiration for Obama&#x2014;that he knows might get him &quot;shot.&quot;</em></p><p data-reactid=".kuunle85j4.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>GQ: How long have you known Newt Gingrich?</strong></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".kuunle85j4.1.1.0.0.4.3"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".kuunle85j4.1.1.0.0.4.5"> <strong>Towery:</strong> [<em>Laughs</em>] My relationship with Newt Gingrich is thirty years long. In the early 1980s I worked for Mack Mattingly, the U.S. Senator from Georgia. I was on his payroll. But I had helped Newt in three debates that he had in 1980. I had won the national bicentennial debate championship. So Newt asked me to help him, because I helped his daughter in a debate workshop. And over the years, I stayed in touch with him. I knew Newt Gingrich through all these times that everyone is talking about.</p><p data-reactid=".kuunle85j4.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>GQ: How would you describe your friendship?</strong></p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".kuunle85j4.1.1.0.0.4.7"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".kuunle85j4.1.1.0.0.4.8"> <strong>Towery:</strong> It&#x2019;s two fists in each other&#x2019;s face.

I&#x2019;m the only person in the world who stands up to him and just beats him up. I&#x2019;m probably the only person in America who will tell Newt Gingrich &quot;Your pants are down&quot; or whatever. I have to tell you, Newt has changed.

And I think that&#x2019;s why our friendship has endured 30 plus years. He was never mean. He was always thoughtful.

And we were the first in South Carolina to show Newt up. But what people don&#x2019;t realize is we were also the first to show him down. So, you know, I&#x2019;m not . . .

Because the room was overcrowded, overwhelmed. It was probably a thousand people trying to get into a 250-person room. And, quite frankly &#x2014; I&#x2019;ll say this on the record &#x2014;I was fearing for his life.

I think he went into the first debate sort of feeling that he was on top, and not prepared for Romney being sharper. The second debate, he had two problems: he was tired, and Wolf Blitzer ran that thing beautifully. So Gingrich wasn&#x2019;t able to pull his usual media castigation. The debate was run very tightly.

I think there has also been sort of a coalescing of some conservative figures who have .... in their mind, there&#x2019;s not just a Democratic elite, there&#x2019;s a conservative elite. And it&#x2019;s made up of a lot of folks who generally stay in Washington all the time. But who nevertheless are very influential in their writings. You look at an Ann Coulter, for example. I mean, fine writer. But I haven&#x2019;t seen her name on a ballot ever. You look at Charles Krauthammer: extremely brilliant guy, but I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s been out of a Washington, D.C. studio in years. George Will: same thing. Almost all of these people...in their minds, suspiciously at once, began to beat Newt to a bloody pulp. It&#x2019;s sort of a good thing, because these are just writers. It caused the Gingrich campaign to reach out to people like Fred Thompson, and to Sarah Palin, and to Herman Cain. And say, Look, these are not your friends, these are the same people who put you down. So he&#x2019;s got the beginnings of an Us-vs.-Them campaign. Which is what he&#x2019;s gonna need if he&#x2019;s gonna keep Romney from getting enough delegates to win this thing on the first ballot... Look, we&#x2019;re headed towards a brokered convention.

You could say, Wow, that&#x2019;s a hell of a lot different from being down twenty. Anybody could be wrong: Florida is very hard to peg. But I pegged it for Politico in 2008, when I had Obama winning by one. The reason I think it might be a little closer for Newt is that ours was the only poll to poll just on the 29th, which was after the endorsement by Cain and Sarah Palin did her thing. In South Carolina, it was the Palin thing that really bucked Newt up. I hate to put so much stock in one person, but she does have an effect. Particularly on men. Our poll showed that Newt had pulled away from Romney on men. But he was getting slaughtered among women. That slaughter I attribute partly to some of the rather grandiose statements he made: saying we&#x2019;re going to colonize the moon doesn&#x2019;t appeal to female voters. They want to think their president will be a strong stable person&#x2014;not that he&#x2019;s not, but he&#x2019;s being portrayed as unstable.
