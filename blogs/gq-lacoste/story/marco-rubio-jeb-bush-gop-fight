  	    "articleBody": "FacebookPinterest\u000A\u000AEarlier this year, as Jeb Bush hopscotched across the country from one big-dollar fundraiser to the next, his aides gave a name to his strategy. They called it \u0022shock and awe\u0022—the goal being, as they explained to The Wall Street Journal at the time, to essentially cow the rest of the GOP presidential field into submission by hoovering up all the available campaign cash and locking down all of the major donors.\u000A\u000AIt was a strategy Jeb\u0027s brother, George W. Bush, had employed to great success in the run-up to his own 2000 presidential campaign, essentially sewing up the nomination before the first caucus or primary vote was even cast. Except, of course, Dubya\u0027s folks didn\u0027t call his strategy \u0022shock and awe\u0022 back then. It wasn\u0027t until the early days of the Iraq War—when Dubya tried bombing Baghdad into the stone age and scaring Saddam Hussein into surrendering—that the term would become part of the popular lexicon. Which is why, when you consider how desperate Jeb is to distinguish (and distance) himself from his brother, \u0022shock and awe\u0022 seems like a pretty stupid way to describe his battle plan.\u000A\u000AAnd now, just like in Iraq, it turns out that Jeb\u0027s \u0022shock and awe\u0022 strategy has been a failure—and he\u0027s girding himself for a long campaign, if not a quagmire. As The New York Times\u0027s Nicholas Confessore and Maggie Haberman noted the other day, not only have the grassroots and the donor class not jumped on board the Jeb bandwagon; other Republican presidential wannabes have not been cowed, either, including Marco Rubio, who officially launches his campaign later today and who likely poses the most serious threat to Bush. In other words, Jeb was unable to be like his brother in the one way he actually wanted to.\u000A\u000ASo, if Dubya\u0027s path to his party\u0027s nomination won\u0027t work for Jeb, what route could? The best-case scenario could look a lot like Mitt Romney\u0027s run in 2012.Romney was the favorite of most establishment Republicans but was never able to gin up much support among conservative activists and Tea Party-types. Yet, the Tea Partiers were never able to unite behind one candidate, alternating their affections among a rotating cast of candidates. One week, it\u0027d be Herman Cain, the next it would be Newt Gingrich, then it would be Rick Santorum. All the while, Romney plodded along and, eventually, he was the last man standing.\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s not hard to see a similar scenario playing out for Jeb in 2016. Although the current race has barely begun, we\u0027ve already seen something of a boom-and-bust cycle for various candidates. Scott Walker garnered praise after a barn-burning speech to Iowa conservative activists in January only to quickly fall out of some of their favor will all get their turns. But none will be able to maintain the momentum, and eventually—maybe in February, maybe in March, maybe even as late as April—enough GOP voters will turn (or return) to Jeb, giving him the nomination, albeit unenthusiastically.\u000A\u000AAnd that\u0027s best-case. The worst-case scenario is that Jeb 2016 will be a replay of Hillary 2008—the last candidate who so clearly tried to cultivate an air of inevitability. Of course, we know how that turned out. But it\u0027s important to examine why it turned out that way. In the 2008 book The Party Decides—which is kind of an academic DaVinci Code for figuring out the presidential primary process—a group of four political scientists argued that for both Democrats and Republicans, the party elites control the nomination, and that they ultimately award it to the candidate they deem the most ideologically reliable but also the most electable. That\u0027s why insurgent candidates (like John McCain in 2000 and Gary Hart in 1984) generally lose (Barry Goldwater and George McGovern being notable exceptions).\u000A\u000AIt\u0027s easy to misremember, but Barack Obama didn\u0027t win in 2008 because he was a shock to the system. On the contrary. \u0022Obama was a challenger but he wasn\u0027t a maverick,\u0022 says David Karol, a University of Maryland political scientist and one of the book\u0027s co-authors. \u0022Obama wasn\u0027t scary to party elites.\u0022 Indeed, after the election, Mark Halperin and John Heilemann revealed that some of those party elites—namely Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer—were actually encouraging Obama to run against Hillary.\u000A\u000ASo if Obama\u0027s win is anything for Jeb, it\u0027s a cautionary tale—a reminder that he now must worry about the wandering eyes of GOP elites. And that\u0027s where Rubio comes in. Yes, the first-term Florida Senator isn\u0027t lighting up the polls: He\u0027s at 5 percent in Iowa and New Hampshire. But he\u0027s making serious inroads in the invisible primary. In January, he wowed GOP donors at a Palm Springs candidate forum sponsored by the Koch Brothers. Last week, he won over a small crowd of mega-rich Republicans at Paul Singer\u0027s New York apartment: \u0022[P]eople who walked out of the room were totally in love,\u0022 one attendee told BuzzFeed\u0027s Rosie Gray.\u000A\u000AThe reasons for the attraction are obvious. Rubio\u0027s come out with a perfectly pitched tax proposal that features popular (with voters) cuts for working families and popular (with GOP elites) cuts for high-income individuals—or, as Josh Barro has termed it, a \u0022Puppies and Rainbows Tax Plan.\u0022 His past support for immigration reform—since somewhat (and unconvincingly) disavowed—is similarly looked upon favorably by the big-money GOP crowd. And then there\u0027s foreign policy. Where Walker has revealed his provincialism (\u0022I can pretty well guarantee you that he is not a subscriber to Foreign Affairs,\u0022 Elliott Abrams told The Washington Post), Paul is being attacked as an isolationist, and even Jeb has, by dint of his associations, angered the pro-Israel crowd, Rubio offers a muscular—and, thanks to his six years in the Senate, seemingly well-informed—view of America\u0027s role in the world. That\u0027s music to GOP elites\u0027 ears.\u000A\u000AThe kickoff of the Rubio campaign will garner for him an inordinate amount of media attention. In other words, he\u0027s about to have his moment, just as Cruz and Paul have recently enjoyed theirs. The big worry for Bush is that, in Rubio\u0027s case, his moment will actually last.\u000A\u000AJason Zengerle is GQ\u0027s political correspondent.",

as Jeb Bush hopscotched across the country from one big-dollar fundraiser to the next, his aides gave a name to his strategy. They called it &quot;shock and awe&quot;&#x2014;the goal being, as they explained to <em><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/jeb-bushs-blitz-to-lock-in-donors-aims-to-squeeze-potential-rivals-1421976835">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> at the time, to essentially cow the rest of the GOP presidential field into submission by hoovering up all the available campaign cash and locking down all of the major donors.</p><p data-reactid=".1t5oa045f5s.1.1.0.0.4.2">It was a strategy Jeb&#x2019;s brother, George W. Bush, had employed to great success in the run-up to his own 2000 presidential campaign, essentially sewing up the nomination before the first caucus or primary vote was even cast. Except, of course, Dubya&#x2019;s folks didn&#x2019;t call his strategy &quot;shock and awe&quot; back then. It wasn&#x2019;t until the early days of the Iraq War&#x2014;when Dubya tried bombing Baghdad into the stone age and scaring Saddam Hussein into surrendering&#x2014;that the term would become part of the popular lexicon. Which is why, when you consider how desperate Jeb is to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/18/us-usa-politics-bush-jeb-idUSKBN0LM06F20150218">distinguish (and distance)</a> himself from his brother, &quot;shock and awe&quot; seems like a pretty stupid way to describe his battle plan.</p><p data-reactid=".1t5oa045f5s.1.1.0.0.4.3">And now, just like in Iraq, it turns out that Jeb&#x2019;s &quot;shock and awe&quot; strategy has been a failure&#x2014;and he&#x2019;s girding himself for a long campaign, if not a quagmire. As <em>The New York Times</em>&#x2019;s Nicholas Confessore and Maggie Haberman <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/us/politics/jeb-bush-as-inevitable-choice-republicans-say-not-so-fast.html?rref=politics&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=context&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=Politics&amp;pgtype=article">noted</a> the other day, not only have the grassroots and the donor class not jumped on board the Jeb bandwagon; other Republican presidential wannabes have not been cowed, either, including Marco Rubio, who officially launches his campaign later today and who likely poses the most serious threat to Bush. In other words, Jeb was unable to be like his brother in the one way he actually wanted to.</p><p data-reactid=".1t5oa045f5s.1.1.0.0.4.5">So, if Dubya&#x2019;s path to his party&#x2019;s nomination won&#x2019;t work for Jeb, what route could? The best-case scenario could look a lot like Mitt Romney&#x2019;s run in 2012.Romney was the favorite of most establishment Republicans but was never able to gin up much support among conservative activists and Tea Party-types. Yet, the Tea Partiers were never able to unite behind one candidate, alternating their affections among a rotating cast of candidates. One week, it&#x2019;d be Herman Cain, the next it would be Newt Gingrich, then it would be Rick Santorum. All the while, Romney plodded along and, eventually, he was the last man standing.</p><p data-reactid=".1t5oa045f5s.1.1.0.0.4.6">It&#x2019;s not hard to see a similar scenario playing out for Jeb in 2016. Although the current race has barely begun, we&#x2019;ve already seen something of a boom-and-bust cycle for various candidates. Scott Walker garnered praise after a barn-burning speech to Iowa conservative activists in January only to quickly <a href="http://theiowarepublican.com/2015/walker-the-biggest-flip-flopper-you-will-ever-find/) for various policy flip-flops. Between his well-received campaign launch and [the news](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-08/exclusive-new-ted-cruz-super-pacs-take-in-record-haul) that his Super PACs have amassed a whopping $31 million in contributions, Ted Cruz is having bit of a moment. So is Rand Paul, whose own campaign launch last week prompted Joe Scarborough to [deem him](http://www.politico.com/playbook/?ml=fo)" title="a very, very important candidate for the Republican Party.&quot; At some point, Bobby Jindal, Rick Perry, maybe even [Chris Christie](http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2015/02/why-chris-christies-demise-is-inevitable.html) (as Romney himself [recently said](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-mitt-romney-has-to-say-about-2016-2015-3) of the New Jersey governor, &quot;America loves a comeback">fall out of some of their favor</a> will all get their turns. But none will be able to maintain the momentum, and eventually&#x2014;maybe in February, maybe in March, maybe even as late as April&#x2014;enough GOP voters will turn (or return) to Jeb, giving him the nomination, albeit unenthusiastically.</p><p data-reactid=".1t5oa045f5s.1.1.0.0.4.7">And that&#x2019;s best-case. The worst-case scenario is that Jeb 2016 will be a replay of Hillary 2008&#x2014;the last candidate who so clearly tried to cultivate an air of inevitability. Of course, we know how that turned out. But it&#x2019;s important to examine why it turned out that way. In the 2008 book <em>The Party Decides</em>&#x2014;which is kind of an academic <em>DaVinci Code</em> for figuring out the presidential primary process&#x2014;a group of four political scientists argued that for both Democrats and Republicans, the party elites control the nomination, and that they ultimately award it to the candidate they deem the most ideologically reliable but also the most electable. That&#x2019;s why insurgent candidates (like John McCain in 2000 and Gary Hart in 1984) generally lose (Barry Goldwater and George McGovern being notable exceptions).</p><p data-reactid=".1t5oa045f5s.1.1.0.0.4.8">It&#x2019;s easy to misremember, but Barack Obama didn&#x2019;t win in 2008 because he was a shock to the system. On the contrary. &quot;Obama was a challenger but he wasn&#x2019;t a maverick,&quot; says David Karol, a University of Maryland political scientist and one of the book&#x2019;s co-authors. &quot;Obama wasn&#x2019;t scary to party elites.&quot; Indeed, after the election, Mark Halperin and John Heilemann <a href="http://nypost.com/2010/01/10/chuck-schumer-hatched-secret-plan-to-get-obama-to-run/">revealed</a> that some of those party elites&#x2014;namely Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer&#x2014;were actually encouraging Obama to run against Hillary.</p><p data-reactid=".1t5oa045f5s.1.1.0.0.4.9">So if Obama&#x2019;s win is anything for Jeb, it&#x2019;s a cautionary tale&#x2014;a reminder that he now must worry about the wandering eyes of GOP elites. And that&#x2019;s where Rubio comes in. Yes, the first-term Florida Senator isn&#x2019;t lighting up the polls: He&#x2019;s at 5 percent in <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ia/iowa_republican_presidential_caucus-3194.html">Iowa</a> and <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/nh/new_hampshire_republican_presidential_primary-3350.html">New Hampshire</a>. But he&#x2019;s making serious inroads in <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/marco-rubio-new-hampshire-iowa-popularily-116840.html">the invisible primary</a>. In January, he <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/rubio-shines-koch-forum_824428.html">wowed GOP donors</a> at a Palm Springs candidate forum sponsored by the Koch Brothers. Last week, he won over a small crowd of mega-rich Republicans at Paul Singer&#x2019;s New York apartment: &quot;[P]eople who walked out of the room were totally in love,&quot; one attendee <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/rubio-wooed-pro-israel-crowd-at-paul-singers-house#.goG4onNmp">told</a> BuzzFeed&#x2019;s Rosie Gray.</p><p data-reactid=".1t5oa045f5s.1.1.0.0.4.a">The reasons for the attraction are obvious. Rubio&#x2019;s come out with a perfectly pitched tax proposal that features popular (with voters) cuts for working families <em>and</em> popular (with GOP elites) cuts for high-income individuals&#x2014;or, as Josh Barro has termed it, a &quot;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/upshot/marco-rubios-puppies-and-rainbows-tax-plan.html">Puppies and Rainbows Tax Plan</a>.&quot; His past support for immigration reform&#x2014;since <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/08/27/marco-rubios-immigration-answer">somewhat (and unconvincingly) disavowed</a>&#x2014;is similarly looked upon favorably by the big-money GOP crowd. And then there&#x2019;s foreign policy. Where Walker has revealed his provincialism (&quot;I can pretty well guarantee you that he is not a subscriber to Foreign Affairs,&quot; Elliott Abrams <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-making-of-scott-walker-statesman/2015/03/06/43b347b0-c286-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html">told</a> <em>The Washington Post</em>), Paul is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/04/06/ad-attacking-rand-paul-on-iran-will-coincide-with-opening-of-his-presidential-campaign/">being attacked</a> as an isolationist, and even Jeb has, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/us/politics/republicans-criticize-james-baker-for-speech-on-benjamin-netanyahu.html">by dint of his associations</a>, angered the pro-Israel crowd, Rubio offers a muscular&#x2014;and, thanks to his six years in the Senate, seemingly well-informed&#x2014;<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/17/marco-rubio-calls-more-muscular-foreign-policy/">view of America&#x2019;s role in the world</a>. That&#x2019;s music to GOP elites&#x2019; ears.</p><p data-reactid=".1t5oa045f5s.1.1.0.0.4.b">The kickoff of the Rubio campaign will garner for him an inordinate amount of media attention. In other words, he&#x2019;s about to have his moment, just as Cruz and Paul have recently enjoyed theirs. The big worry for Bush is that, in Rubio&#x2019;s case, his moment will actually last.</p><p data-reactid=".1t5oa045f5s.1.1.0.0.4.c"><em>Jason Zengerle is GQ&#x2019;s political
