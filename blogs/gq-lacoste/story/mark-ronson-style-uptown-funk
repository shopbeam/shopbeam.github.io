The DJ-turnt-producer-turnt-chart-god has long epitomized what it means to be ahead of the curveregistering all the major shifts in music and fashion culture in a way that still looks and feels authentic and highly personal. It\u0027s way easier said than donewhich is why the guy who made \u0022Uptown Funk\u0022 also made our 2015 Most Stylish list.\u000A\u000ACongratulations on being one of the 20 most stylish men on planet earth, dude! Let\u0027s talk about how your style has evolved through the years. In the late \u002790s, when you were DJing in downtown New York, it was all about sneakers and T-shirts, right?\u000A\u000A It was pretty much Air Max or Air Force 1\u0027s, jeansnot too baggy but certainly not like today. There was almost the downtown hip-hop dress code, you know? As a DJ, you were just in a corner, an unlit booth, you weren\u0027t on display, no one really cared. You didn\u0027t feel like you had to dress for the show or anything. You just kind of wore a cool T-shirt from Supreme or Union, or a Knicks jersey. That was it.\u000A\u000AOccasionally, I\u0027d DJ these high-end parties, and I remember having this one slightly surreal experience of Puffy taking me to Paris to DJ for him, and going to the Versace store with him and Andre Harrell, and buying some suit that I thought was so cool that I could only ever wear once. Just ridiculous.\u000A\u000AIt seems like, back then, the sneakers you chose or the store that you bought your T-shirt fromthat was everything. That was your coded language and your way of signifying.\u000A\u000A Yeah, how cool your T-shirt was, that was your chance to show your thing. So people wore T-shirts with old school hip-hop images, or Biggie\u0027s face, or some sort of ironic hip-hop quote. My theory of why people in California and beach cultures have so many tattoos is because nobody wears clothes, so the tattoo is your only chance to show off or have any kind of signifiers or something individual on yourself.\u000A\u000ASo I had my collection of what I thought were cool T-shirts. This was definitely before hipster culture. The first time that I felt there was something much cooler going on fashion-wise and style-wise that I didn\u0027t know about was when the Strokes ushered in the skinny-jeans era. It was like, Whoa. I remember going to Don Hill\u0027s on Misshapes nights and being like, OK, something happened when I wasn\u0027t looking.\u000A\u000ASo how did you react to that?\u000A\u000A So I\u0027m a DJ but there was this new indie rock subculture. I left it alone for a little while, but like everybody else, you know, your clothes started to get a little slimmer. I remember, the most I\u0027d ever paid for something in a store was probably $300 bucks for a rare pair of Air Max or something, and I went into that Dior store on 57th St. and tried on a jacket. I took it to the counter and they rang it up. It was like $1,900 dollars. You know that moment in the movie when everything freezes?\u000A\u000ADid you pull the trigger?\u000A\u000A I did, because it was too late. But I didn\u0027t have a concept that clothes could cost that much money. And then I guess I was doing that [Hedi-Slimane-era] Dior stuff not just for the rock \u0027n\u0027 roll side of it but just to have some nice suits and tailoring. I wasn\u0027t quite skinny enough to fit into it, but I did alright. After that, when I started doing some different stuff stylistically it was with you guys, actually. With GQ and [fashion director] Madeleine [Weeks]that shoot was my real introduction to nice clothes in a way.\u000A\u000AOnce you had that introduction on that 2007 GQ shoot in Paris, where did you take it from there? It doesn\u0027t just take money to keep your style evolving, it takes time and effort.\u000A\u000A I approach the style thing the same way I approach my music. You have sounds from certain eras that you like, but you\u0027re never trying to ape or recreate a certain era. You\u0027re trying to put it out there in a way that it feels like it\u0027s your own.\u000A\u000AWhat were you thinking when you decided to bleach your hair? Was it considered or spur of the moment?\u000A\u000A To be honest, I\u0027m gonna blame it on being wasted for most of 2010. That was really just an impulsive thing. I was at a shoot for BlackBook and they asked if I\u0027d be down to do it. But at the time, I was working on an album with Duran Duran. And I think I was trying to swear off anything that had to do with Version, because, especially in the English press, I was getting all this flack, like, \u0022Oh, it\u0027s the horn guy! It\u0027s the \u002760s trumpet guy!\u0022 So I was like, OK, this album will have no horns, and I will do ridiculous things to my hair, and whatever else it takes [to distance myself]. But there wasn\u0027t a lot of thought that went into it, to be honest. They were just like, \u0022Hey, would you mind dyeing your hair this morning?\u0022 My wife dug it, and I was kind of allright.\u000A\u000AIn a way you were trying to mark a transition.\u000A\u000A I think so. I was definitely trying to shake off some of whatever had been going on for the past few years.\u000A\u000AYou\u0027re generally known for skinny suits, but the first time I saw you in a full-cut, 1940\u0027s style suit was two years ago at your Grammy party at the Chateau Marmont. What\u0027s the feeling that you get when it\u0027s time to switch-up to something nobody else is doing like that?\u000A\u000A I think you just get a little bored. A silhouette\u0027s not that different to a drum sound to me. You do it for a while, you know it works, and then you lean on it too hardthe same way I leaned on the Dap-Kings\u0027 sound for a bitand then you realize that it\u0027s definitely time to do something else. I guess the difference is that I used to be quite extreme about it. Like, \u0022I\u0027m going to wear this kind of thing only for the next year.\u0022 Now it\u0027s just like, fuck it. If you have something that you like, and one\u0027s a wide leg pant and the other\u0027s a skinny pant, there\u0027s no reason you can\u0027t wear one today and the other the next. You\u0027re not declaring that this new thing is my life from now on. Maybe if I was 25 and in a subculture I would do that, but now I feel like I\u0027m just a little beyond that. They\u0027re both a classic look that\u0027s been worn by some of my heroes. So you try to put your own spin on it.\u000A\u000AYou told me one time that you were in the studio producing the Kaiser Chiefs, and you wore a tie every day because it commanded a certain attention that fit your role with that band. \u000A\u000A Right. And the day I didn\u0027t wear a tie, no one would listen to me. It was laundry day.\u000A\u000ASo how does the way you dress affect the tone you set for your work?\u000A\u000A I like the idea of dressing for the studio, because it means you take your work seriously. But it\u0027s ridiculous to say that\u0027s a rule, because some of my favorite music ever was made by people who were probably wearing sweatpants and T-shirts, hunched over an MPC. So it really depends. I think five years ago, I would have declared: I\u0027m only about this one thing, this is what I\u0027m going to do every day for the next six months. But I\u0027ve tried to loosen up on those types of thingsand in life in general. That said, I do have a lot of respect for those greats, like Quincy [Jones] and whoever else, and I can\u0027t imagine them going to the studio wearing a T-shirt.",

chart the movements of cool-guy style for the past fifteen to twenty years, you could put together a really complex flow chart, or you could just look at pictures of Mark Ronson through the years. The DJ-turnt-producer-turnt-chart-god has long epitomized what it means to be ahead of the curveregistering all the major shifts in music and fashion culture in a way that still looks and feels authentic and highly personal. It&apos;s way easier said than donewhich is why the guy who made &quot;Uptown Funk&quot; also made our 2015 Most Stylish list.</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.2"><strong>Congratulations on being one of the 20 most stylish men on planet earth, dude! Let&apos;s talk about how your style has evolved through the years. In the late &apos;90s, when you were DJing in downtown New York, it was all about sneakers and T-shirts, right?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.3"> It was pretty much Air Max or Air Force 1&apos;s, jeansnot too baggy but certainly not like today. There was almost the downtown hip-hop dress code, you know? As a DJ, you were just in a corner, an unlit booth, you weren&apos;t on display, no one really cared. You didn&apos;t feel like you had to dress for the show or anything. You just kind of wore a cool T-shirt from Supreme or Union, or a Knicks jersey. That was it.</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.5">Occasionally, I&apos;d DJ these high-end parties, and I remember having this one slightly surreal experience of Puffy taking me to Paris to DJ for him, and going to the Versace store with him and Andre Harrell, and buying some suit that I thought was so cool that I could only ever wear once. Just ridiculous.</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.6"><strong>It seems like, back then, the sneakers you chose or the store that you bought your T-shirt fromthat was everything. That was your coded language and your way of signifying.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.7"> Yeah, how cool your T-shirt was, that was your chance to show your thing. So people wore T-shirts with old school hip-hop images, or Biggie&apos;s face, or some sort of ironic hip-hop quote. My theory of why people in California and beach cultures have so many tattoos is because nobody wears clothes, so the tattoo is your only chance to show off or have any kind of signifiers or something individual on yourself.</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.8">So I had my collection of what I thought were cool T-shirts. This was definitely before hipster culture. The first time that I felt there was something much cooler going on fashion-wise and style-wise that I didn&apos;t know about was when the Strokes ushered in the skinny-jeans era. It was like, Whoa. I remember going to Don Hill&apos;s on Misshapes nights and being like, OK, something happened when I wasn&apos;t looking.</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.9"><strong>So how did you react to that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.a"> So I&apos;m a DJ but there was this new indie rock subculture. I left it alone for a little while, but like everybody else, you know, your clothes started to get a little slimmer. I remember, the most I&apos;d ever paid for something in a store was probably $300 bucks for a rare pair of Air Max or something, and I went into that Dior store on 57th St. and tried on a jacket. I took it to the counter and they rang it up. It was like $1,900 dollars. You know that moment in the movie when everything freezes?</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.b"><strong>Did you pull the trigger?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.c"> I did, because it was too late. But I didn&apos;t have a concept that clothes could cost that much money. And then I guess I was doing that [Hedi-Slimane-era] Dior stuff not just for the rock &apos;n&apos; roll side of it but just to have some nice suits and tailoring. I wasn&apos;t quite skinny enough to fit into it, but I did alright. After that, when I started doing some different stuff stylistically it was with you guys, actually. With GQ and [fashion director] Madeleine [Weeks]that shoot was my real introduction to nice clothes in a way.</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.d"><strong>Once you had that introduction on that 2007 GQ shoot in Paris, where did you take it from there? It doesn&apos;t just take money to keep your style evolving, it takes time and effort.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.e"> I approach the style thing the same way I approach my music. You have sounds from certain eras that you like, but you&apos;re never trying to ape or recreate a certain era. You&apos;re trying to put it out there in a way that it feels like it&apos;s your own.</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.f"><strong>What were you thinking when you decided to bleach your hair? Was it considered or spur of the moment?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.g"> To be honest, I&apos;m gonna blame it on being wasted for most of 2010. That was really just an impulsive thing. I was at a shoot for BlackBook and they asked if I&apos;d be down to do it. But at the time, I was working on an album with Duran Duran. And I think I was trying to swear off anything that had to do with Version, because, especially in the English press, I was getting all this flack, like, &quot;Oh, it&apos;s the horn guy! It&apos;s the &apos;60s trumpet guy!&quot; So I was like, OK, this album will have no horns, and I will do ridiculous things to my hair, and whatever else it takes [to distance myself]. But there wasn&apos;t a lot of thought that went into it, to be honest. They were just like, &quot;Hey, would you mind dyeing your hair this morning?&quot; My wife dug it, and I was kind of allright.</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.h"><strong>In a way you were trying to mark a transition.</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.i"> I think so. I was definitely trying to shake off some of whatever had been going on for the past few years.</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.j"><strong>You&apos;re generally known for skinny suits, but the first time I saw you in a full-cut, 1940&apos;s style suit was two years ago at your Grammy party at the Chateau Marmont. What&apos;s the feeling that you get when it&apos;s time to switch-up to something nobody else is doing like that?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.k"> I think you just get a little bored. A silhouette&apos;s not that different to a drum sound to me. You do it for a while, you know it works, and then you lean on it too hardthe same way I leaned on the Dap-Kings&apos; sound for a bitand then you realize that it&apos;s definitely time to do something else. I guess the difference is that I used to be quite extreme about it. Like, &quot;I&apos;m going to wear this kind of thing only for the next year.&quot; Now it&apos;s just like, fuck it. If you have something that you like, and one&apos;s a wide leg pant and the other&apos;s a skinny pant, there&apos;s no reason you can&apos;t wear one today and the other the next. You&apos;re not declaring that this new thing is my life from now on. Maybe if I was 25 and in a subculture I would do that, but now I feel like I&apos;m just a little beyond that. They&apos;re both a classic look that&apos;s been worn by some of my heroes. So you try to put your own spin on it.</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.l"><strong>You told me one time that you were in the studio producing the Kaiser Chiefs, and you wore a tie every day because it commanded a certain attention that fit your role with that band. </strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.m"> Right. And the day I didn&apos;t wear a tie, no one would listen to me. It was laundry day.</p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.n"><strong>So how does the way you dress affect the tone you set for your work?</strong></p><p data-reactid=".2cku0eb29kw.1.1.0.0.4.o"> I like the idea of dressing for the studio, because it means you take your work seriously. But it&apos;s ridiculous to say that&apos;s a rule, because some of my favorite music ever was made by people who were probably wearing sweatpants and T-shirts, hunched over an MPC. So it really depends. I think five years ago, I would have declared: I&apos;m only about this one thing, this is what I&apos;m going to do every day for the next six months. But I&apos;ve tried to loosen up on those types of thingsand in life in general. That said, I do have a lot of respect for those greats, like Quincy [Jones] and whoever else, and I can&apos;t imagine them going to the studio wearing a T-shirt.</p></div><div class="grid"
