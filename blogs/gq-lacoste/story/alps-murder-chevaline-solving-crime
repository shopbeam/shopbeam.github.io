  	    "articleBody": "Four dead, an ever-expanding list of suspects, dozens of detectives on the case. Three years after the fact, a mysterious shooting in the French Alps has evolved into one of the most confounding, globe-spanning criminal investigations in decades. On this, the third anniversary, Sean Flynn returns to the scene of the crime in an attempt to crack the unsolvable murders on the mountain. This is the first of six parts—to see the full series so far, go here\u000A\u000AThe driver was a British engineer born in Iraq who worked on satellite systems in Surrey, and maybe that\u0027s why he was dead and all the others were, too. On a Wednesday afternoon in September 2012, Saad al-Hilli drove his maroon BMW from a campground on the shore of Lake Annecy, in the French Alps, and into a tiny community called Chevaline, at the far edge of which the pavement slips into the trees. The path rising out of Chevaline is steep and pocked and hyphenated by tight bridges crossing a noisy froth of water. For three kilometers, there is nowhere to turn around and nowhere to go but up, and then there is nowhere to go at all. The public road ends at a small parking area, where Saad nosed his BMW to the tree line.\u000A\u000ASeptember 5 was a spectacular day, sunlight drizzling through foliage that twitched with the breeze. Saad, who was 50, stood with his elder daughter, 7-year-old Zainab, maybe talking to a local cyclist who\u0027d pedaled up the mountain or maybe just absorbed in the scenery. It is impossible to say for sure.\u000A\u000AAlmost certainly, though, he didn\u0027t see the shooter in the trees before he heard the ﬁrst shots.\u000A\u000ASaad screamed at Zainab to get in the car. He quickstepped to the driver\u0027s door, twisted into the seat. But Zainab hadn\u0027t moved, just stood there, frozen. Saad probably didn\u0027t realize that. What man leaves his daughter to get shot? He slapped the gearshift into reverse, cranked the wheel hard to the left, stomped on the gas. The BMW skittered backward in an arc, a jittery half circle. The shooter was out of the woods by then, standing in the center of the arc like a pivot point. The car completed the turn, the rear against the tree line, got stuck, wheels trenching divots into the loose soil at the edge of the forest.\u000A\u000ASaad had clipped the French cyclist with the bumper, dragged him through the turn, left him bleeding in the dirt.\u000A\u000AMost likely Saad already was dead. He was shot four times, twice in the head. His wife, a 47-year-old dentist named Iqbal, was dead in the backseat, also shot four times, also twice in the head. Her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, was dead, too, shot three times, twice in the head. The cyclist was shot ﬁve times, including twice in the head. Zainab was still alive, though barely: She was shot once in the shoulder, then clubbed in the skull with the butt of the gun.\u000A\u000AThe shooter had ﬁred 21 times, mostly at a moving vehicle. Seventeen bullets hit people. None of them struck the frame or the doors or the fenders or any other part of the BMW. Eight of them were head shots.\u000A\u000AApparently he was a professional.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AThe EMTs arrived minutes after Zainab was found collapsed in the road by a British cyclist who happened upon the scene. The gendarmes, who are part of the French military and responsible for policing the rural districts, swarmed the mountain close behind them.\u000A\u000AUniformed officers closed off the road, the Route de la Combe d\u0027Ire, and forensic technicians gathered shell casings and marked where they fell and photographed the blood and studied Saad\u0027s BMW without disturbing any of the bodies. They did this with such delicacy that they did not notice for almost eight hours that Saad\u0027s younger daughter, 4-year-old Zeena, was alive and physically unharmed, hiding beneath the folds of her dead mother\u0027s skirt.\u000A\u000AInvestigators are not supposed to embrace reﬂexive theories in the moments immediately following a crime, and the prosecutor in Annecy insists they did not. \u0022The only thing that came to mind,\u0022 Eric Maillaud says of all the blood and bodies, \u0022is that we have someone who has no respect for human life.\u0022 He says this slowly, deliberately. Maillaud, who is 53 years old, has been a prosecutor for eleven years, ﬁve of them in Annecy, which is a small, serene city unaccustomed to spectacular spasms of violence. Only one or two people are murdered in a typical year, and those are routine as killings go: domestics or robberies or escalated arguments, single ﬂashes of rage. But this on the mountain? \u0022There are very few people who are capable of killing so many people,\u0022 Maillaud says. \u0022And to try to kill children?\u0022 He shakes his head slowly. \u0022So we know we are dealing with savages. That is the only thing that comes to mind.\u0022\u000A\u000ASavages was perhaps the ﬁrst thing to come to mind, but other thoughts—obvious and understandable thoughts—surely followed in quick succession. Detectives, no matter how well trained and dispassionate, are plagued by the same instincts and bias toward common sense as any layman. There were four dead people in the forest, a crime heretofore unimaginable in Annecy. One of those people was a local man known to be an ardent cyclist. The other three were strangers, foreigners, the patriarch of whom was an Arab engineer with technical data and complicated schematics—the matériel of spies and terrorists—on laptops and thumb drives in his camper by the lake.\u000A\u000AThey\u0027d all gotten two in the head, the way special ops and assassins are trained to do it.\u000A\u000AIt all seemed so obvious three years ago, exactly what happened. Saad al-Hilli got whacked. He was stupid enough to have his family with him, so they got killed, too. The Frenchman? Poor bastard just had the miserable luck of being in the wrong place at the worst time.\u000A\u000AWhat other explanation could there be?\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AZaid al-Hilli found out his brother was dead the day after the murders, on September 6. He learned this from a friend whose wife had seen it on television, a quadruple murder in the French Alps being the kind of story that gets a signiﬁcant amount of attention in the European press.\u000A\u000AHe went to his local police station, in Esher, England, that afternoon to ask for details, but neither the officers there nor a detective in major crimes knew any more than he did.\u000A\u000AThe next day, the police came to his ﬂat to officially tell him his brother was dead. There was a swarm of reporters on the sidewalk out front, so the officers kindly escorted him out and put him up in a barracks—\u0022like a little hotel room, really,\u0022 Zaid says—ﬁrst in Surrey, then in Sussex. The English detectives asked Zaid to account for his whereabouts between August 25 and September 5, and they asked for his mobile phone and his laptop. After two weeks as a guest of the local constabulary, after the press had ﬁnally dispersed, Zaid went home.\u000A\u000AEnglish investigators had been assisting their French counterparts from the beginning, which is a matter of routine in international homicides. To ﬁgure out why someone was murdered, it is useful to understand who that person was—to know his routines and habits, his skeletons and foibles. So the French came across the channel, Maillaud among them, to ask questions and pull records and request searches. They were convinced, just days after the killings, that someone wanted Saad al-Hilli dead. \u0022Without a doubt,\u0022 Maillaud told reporters near London on September 13, \u0022the reasons and the causes have their origins in this country.\u0022\u000A\u000AZaid had no idea what those reasons and causes might be. Nor did he know his brother had been in France. He knew he liked to travel, towing a Bürstner camper behind his BMW, and he knew Saad owned a broken-down ruin of a house in Burgundy he thought he might rebuild someday. But Zaid had never known him to go to Annecy, except for that one time when they were children on holiday in Geneva. Zaid remembered being on a boat beneath a smudgy gray sky, but little else. And it was slightly peculiar, he thought, Saad going camping with the girls so late in the summer, when the school year was beginning.\u000A\u000ATruth is, Zaid didn\u0027t know much of anything Saad did anymore. The brothers hadn\u0027t spoken in almost a year, since October 2011, except through solicitors sorting out their late father\u0027s estate. There were more than a million dollars in a Swiss account and a house south of London in Claygate and a small studio in Spain and considerable disagreement about who should get what. It was contentious and sad, but Zaid believed they were civil about it, he and his brother. \u0022There was no feud,\u0022 he says. \u0022We weren\u0027t riding around on horses shooting at each other.\u0022 They let their lawyers write letters and ﬁle briefs instead.\u000A\u000AHe knew that Saad worked on satellite systems. But he found the theory that intrigued the French and delighted the tabloids—that Saad was killed, and got everyone else killed, because he was selling secrets—preposterous. Zaid was certain his brother was not a spy, industrial or otherwise. Saad was a freelance mechanical engineer. He wasn\u0027t involved in classiﬁed optics or encrypted communications technology; he had no secrets, nor access to them. And anyway, he would have made a lousy spy. \u0022Saad is outspoken,\u0022 he says, \u0022and outspoken people aren\u0027t capable of anything like that.\u0022\u000A\u000AEric Maillaud was wrong, then. Zaid believed that, too. The reasons and causes of four murders in the Alps did not have their origins in England. Why would they? Even if someone had wanted Saad dead, it would have been much simpler to kill him at home. Why go all the way to France and slaughter his family, too? To Zaid, this was plainly logical: Saad and his family were in the wrong place at the wrong time, casualties of a local killing, not the other way around. Surely the authorities would quickly ﬁgure that out.\u000A\u000ATwenty-three days after the murders, on Friday, September 28, the police knocked on Zaid\u0027s door again. They had a warrant to search his ﬂat.\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000AFacebookPinterest\u000A\u000ASolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part OneSolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part TwoSolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part Three: The CyclistSolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part Four\u000ASolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part Five\u000ASolving the Perfect Murders of L\u0027Affaire de Chevaline: Part Six\u000A\u000A\u000A\u000ASean Flynn is a GQ correspondent.",

data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4"><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.0"><em>Four dead, an ever-expanding list of suspects, dozens of detectives on the case. Three years after the fact, a mysterious shooting in the French Alps has evolved into one of the most confounding, globe-spanning criminal investigations in decades. On this, the third anniversary, Sean Flynn returns to the scene of the crime in an attempt to crack the unsolvable murders on the mountain. <strong>This is the first of six parts&#x2014;to see the full series so far, go <a href="../search?tags=perfect%2520crime">here</a></strong></em></p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.1">The driver was a British engineer born in Iraq who worked on satellite systems in Surrey, and maybe that&#x2019;s why he was dead and all the others were, too. On a Wednesday afternoon in September 2012, Saad al-Hilli drove his maroon BMW from a campground on the shore of Lake Annecy, in the French Alps, and into a tiny community called Chevaline, at the far edge of which the pavement slips into the trees. The path rising out of Chevaline is steep and pocked and hyphenated by tight bridges crossing a noisy froth of water. For three kilometers, there is nowhere to turn around and nowhere to go but up, and then there is nowhere to go at all. The public road ends at a small parking area, where Saad nosed his BMW to the tree line.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.2">September 5 was a spectacular day, sunlight drizzling through foliage that twitched with the breeze. Saad, who was 50, stood with his elder daughter, 7-year-old Zainab, maybe talking to a local cyclist who&#x2019;d pedaled up the mountain or maybe just absorbed in the scenery. It is impossible to say for sure.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.3">Almost certainly, though, he didn&#x2019;t see the shooter in the trees before he heard the &#xFB01;rst shots.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.5">Saad screamed at Zainab to get in the car. He quickstepped to the driver&#x2019;s door, twisted into the seat. But Zainab hadn&#x2019;t moved, just stood there, frozen. Saad probably didn&#x2019;t realize that. What man leaves his daughter to get shot? He slapped the gearshift into reverse, cranked the wheel hard to the left, stomped on the gas. The BMW skittered backward in an arc, a jittery half circle. The shooter was out of the woods by then, standing in the center of the arc like a pivot point. The car completed the turn, the rear against the tree line, got stuck, wheels trenching divots into the loose soil at the edge of the forest.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.6">Saad had clipped the French cyclist with the bumper, dragged him through the turn, left him bleeding in the dirt.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.7">Most likely Saad already was dead. He was shot four times, twice in the head. His wife, a 47-year-old dentist named Iqbal, was dead in the backseat, also shot four times, also twice in the head. Her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, was dead, too, shot three times, twice in the head. The cyclist was shot &#xFB01;ve times, including twice in the head. Zainab was still alive, though barely: She was shot once in the shoulder, then clubbed in the skull with the butt of the gun.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.8">The shooter had &#xFB01;red 21 times, mostly at a moving vehicle. Seventeen bullets hit people. None of them struck the frame or the doors or the fenders or any other part of the BMW. Eight of them were head shots.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.9">Apparently he was a professional.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.a"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.b">The EMTs arrived minutes after Zainab was found collapsed in the road by a British cyclist who happened upon the scene. The gendarmes, who are part of the French military and responsible for policing the rural districts, swarmed the mountain close behind them.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.c">Uniformed officers closed off the road, the Route de la Combe d&#x2019;Ire, and forensic technicians gathered shell casings and marked where they fell and photographed the blood and studied Saad&#x2019;s BMW without disturbing any of the bodies. They did this with such delicacy that they did not notice for almost eight hours that Saad&#x2019;s younger daughter, 4-year-old Zeena, was alive and physically unharmed, hiding beneath the folds of her dead mother&#x2019;s skirt.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.d">Investigators are not supposed to embrace re&#xFB02;exive theories in the moments immediately following a crime, and the prosecutor in Annecy insists they did not. &#x201C;The only thing that came to mind,&#x201D; Eric Maillaud says of all the blood and bodies, &#x201C;is that we have someone who has no respect for human life.&#x201D; He says this slowly, deliberately. Maillaud, who is 53 years old, has been a prosecutor for eleven years, &#xFB01;ve of them in Annecy, which is a small, serene city unaccustomed to spectacular spasms of violence. Only one or two people are murdered in a typical year, and those are routine as killings go: domestics or robberies or escalated arguments, single &#xFB02;ashes of rage. But this on the mountain? &#x201C;There are very few people who are capable of killing so many people,&#x201D; Maillaud says. &#x201C;And to try to kill children?&#x201D; He shakes his head slowly. &#x201C;So we know we are dealing with savages. That is the only thing that comes to mind.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.e"><em>Savages</em> was perhaps the <em>&#xFB01;rst</em> thing to come to mind, but other thoughts&#x2014;obvious and understandable thoughts&#x2014;surely followed in quick succession. Detectives, no matter how well trained and dispassionate, are plagued by the same instincts and bias toward common sense as any layman. There were four dead people in the forest, a crime heretofore unimaginable in Annecy. One of those people was a local man known to be an ardent cyclist. The other three were strangers, foreigners, the patriarch of whom was an Arab engineer with technical data and complicated schematics&#x2014;the mat&#xE9;riel of spies and terrorists&#x2014;on laptops and thumb drives in his camper by the lake.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.f">They&#x2019;d all gotten two in the head, the way special ops and assassins are trained to do it.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.g">It all seemed so obvious three years ago, exactly what happened. Saad al-Hilli got whacked. He was stupid enough to have his family with him, so they got killed, too. The Frenchman? Poor bastard just had the miserable luck of being in the wrong place at the worst time.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.h">What other explanation could there be?</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.i"><hr></div><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.j">Zaid al-Hilli found out his brother was dead the day after the murders, on September 6. He learned this from a friend whose wife had seen it on television, a quadruple murder in the French Alps being the kind of story that gets a signi&#xFB01;cant amount of attention in the European press.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.k">He went to his local police station, in Esher, England, that afternoon to ask for details, but neither the officers there nor a detective in major crimes knew any more than he did.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.l">The next day, the police came to his &#xFB02;at to officially tell him his brother was dead. There was a swarm of reporters on the sidewalk out front, so the officers kindly escorted him out and put him up in a barracks&#x2014;&#x201D;like a little hotel room, really,&#x201D; Zaid says&#x2014;&#xFB01;rst in Surrey, then in Sussex. The English detectives asked Zaid to account for his whereabouts between August 25 and September 5, and they asked for his mobile phone and his laptop. After two weeks as a guest of the local constabulary, after the press had &#xFB01;nally dispersed, Zaid went home.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.m">English investigators had been assisting their French counterparts from the beginning, which is a matter of routine in international homicides. To &#xFB01;gure out why someone was murdered, it is useful to understand who that person was&#x2014;to know his routines and habits, his skeletons and foibles. So the French came across the channel, Maillaud among them, to ask questions and pull records and request searches. They were convinced, just days after the killings, that someone wanted Saad al-Hilli dead. &#x201C;Without a doubt,&#x201D; Maillaud told reporters near London on September 13, &#x201C;the reasons and the causes have their origins in this country.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.n">Zaid had no idea what those reasons and causes might be. Nor did he know his brother had been in France. He knew he liked to travel, towing a B&#xFC;rstner camper behind his BMW, and he knew Saad owned a broken-down ruin of a house in Burgundy he thought he might rebuild someday. But Zaid had never known him to go to Annecy, except for that one time when they were children on holiday in Geneva. Zaid remembered being on a boat beneath a smudgy gray sky, but little else. And it was slightly peculiar, he thought, Saad going camping with the girls so late in the summer, when the school year was beginning.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.o">Truth is, Zaid didn&#x2019;t know much of anything Saad did anymore. The brothers hadn&#x2019;t spoken in almost a year, since October 2011, except through solicitors sorting out their late father&#x2019;s estate. There were more than a million dollars in a Swiss account and a house south of London in Claygate and a small studio in Spain and considerable disagreement about who should get what. It was contentious and sad, but Zaid believed they were civil about it, he and his brother. &#x201C;There was no <em>feud,</em>&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;We weren&#x2019;t riding around on horses shooting at each other.&#x201D; They let their lawyers write letters and &#xFB01;le briefs instead.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.p">He knew that Saad worked on satellite systems. But he found the theory that intrigued the French and delighted the tabloids&#x2014;that Saad was killed, and got everyone else killed, because he was selling secrets&#x2014;preposterous. Zaid was certain his brother was not a spy, industrial or otherwise. Saad was a freelance mechanical engineer. He wasn&#x2019;t involved in classi&#xFB01;ed optics or encrypted communications technology; he had no secrets, nor access to them. And anyway, he would have made a lousy spy. &#x201C;Saad is outspoken,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;and outspoken people aren&#x2019;t capable of anything like that.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.q">Eric Maillaud was wrong, then. Zaid believed that, too. The reasons and causes of four murders in the Alps did not have their origins in England. Why would they? Even if someone had wanted Saad dead, it would have been much simpler to kill him at home. Why go all the way to France and slaughter his family, too? To Zaid, this was plainly logical: Saad and his family were in the wrong place at the wrong time, casualties of a local killing, not the other way around. Surely the authorities would quickly &#xFB01;gure that out.</p><p data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.r">Twenty-three days after the murders, on Friday, September 28, the police knocked on Zaid&#x2019;s door again. They had a warrant to search his &#xFB02;at.</p><div class="embed hr" data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.s"><hr></div><div class="embed callout" data-reactid=".15eteg7mscg.1.1.0.0.4.t"><div class="callout omfg" data-type="callout"><figure class="embedded-image" data-type="image"><div class="image-content"><div class="component-rendition"><div class="component-image loaded"><span><img src="http://media.gq.com/photos/55f34e3b89c0d3e261b21cad/master/w_806/banner-square.1c.jpg" alt="banner-square.1c.jpg"></span></div></div><div class="component-social-share default"><div class="share-item facebook" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Falps-murder-chevaline-solving-crime&amp;t=banner-square.1c.jpg"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Falps-murder-chevaline-solving-crime&amp;t=banner-square.1c.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Facebook"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="share-item pinterest" data-href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Falps-murder-chevaline-solving-crime&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f34e3b89c0d3e261b21cad%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fbanner-square.1c.jpg&amp;description=banner-square.1c.jpg"><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Falps-murder-chevaline-solving-crime&amp;media=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gq.com%2Fphotos%2F55f34e3b89c0d3e261b21cad%2F1%3A1%2Fw_680%2Cc_limit%2Fbanner-square.1c.jpg&amp;description=banner-square.1c.jpg" target="_blank" aria-label="Pinterest"><span class="icon"></span><span class="label">Pinterest</span></a></div></div></div></figure>
